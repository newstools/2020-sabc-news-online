The African National Congress (ANC) NEC will resume the second day of its virtual Lekgotla on Monday. Issues that are expected to top the agenda are the economic recovery plan and corruption. This comes at a time when some ANC leaders are involved in allegations of corruption linked to PPE contracts awarded during the COVID-19 lockdown. The Lekgotla brings together Alliance partners and ANC deployees in national, provincial, and local sphere government as well as strategic sectors in society, including business, civil society, and traditional leaders. The ANC NEC Lekgotla takes place during the worst economic crisis as a result of the coronavirus. The local economy plunged 51% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, during the hard lockdown. Unemployment remains stubbornly high with inflation rising and growth stagnant. It will now be all hands-on deck at the governing party’s NEC Lekgotla to find ways to re-ignite the economy. Corruption remains an issue that would be hard for the ANC to ignore this after the recent countrywide police swoop on people accused of corruption.
