The State Capture Inquiry continues Thursday afternoon, with more testimony related to power utility Eskom. Earlier, former Eskom board member Venete Klein testified that she recalled seeing former board chairperson Ben Ngubane appearing relentless on the phone with former Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown before a major decision was made. She has told the commission that the decision related to the inclusion of the power utilityâ€™s former finance director on the list of executives who were to be suspended in 2015.
