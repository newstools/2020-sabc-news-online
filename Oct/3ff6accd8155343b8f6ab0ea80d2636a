It is believed Luqmaan Jardien was playing in the backyard of his home when the incident occurred. Police Spokesperson, FC Van Wyk, says they have opened an inquest docket for investigation. “Philippi police are investigating an inquest after a death of a three-year-old boy on Monday, the 26th of October at about eight in the evening.
