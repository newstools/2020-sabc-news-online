The Special Tribunal, sitting in the High Court in Johannesburg, has postponed the appeal to the freezing of R38.7 million belonging to 40 companies that scored Personal Protective Equipment  (PPE) deals in Gauteng. Judge Billy Motlhe postponed the case to the 20th of  November for arguments. In August, the Special Tribunal was granted an interim order to freeze several bank accounts of the contractors. The judge clarified that the order only relates to money obtained through the Gauteng PPE contracts. That’s after it emerged that some banks have frozen money that are not linked to the PPE corruption scandal. Judge Motlhe has set aside two days for arguments, including a Saturday to avoid the matter dragging into December. “It means that the ruling is extended to the 20th and we will sit on the 20th and 21st November for the hearing. The 1st, 13th and 14th respondents and any other respondents who want to file answering affidavits shall file their answering affidavits by 12 October 2020,” says Judge Motlhe.
