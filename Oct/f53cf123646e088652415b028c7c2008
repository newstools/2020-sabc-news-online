The Gift of the Givers has donated a hundred beds, 30 high nasal oxygen machines and supplementary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the Bhisho hospital. Organisation coordinator, Corene Conradie says, “Due to this donation the hospital was able to open the COVID-19 ward. At this moment they have plus-minus 50 patients and if it wasn’t for the donation from us as a partnership with this hospital this would have not been possible.” Meanwhile, the cumulative number of  COVID-19 cases in South Africa has increased to 719 714 with 1 863 new cases.
