Chairperson of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL), Professor David Mosoma, says the commission is trying to get to the bottom of allegations of abuse at the KwaSizabantu Mission in Kranskop in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The mission has come under the spotlight following allegations of abuse and money laundering by some of its members.
