Former advisor Siyabonga Mahlangu to then Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba has backtracked on his initial statement to the State Capture Commission, admitting that he had in fact advised Gigaba about former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama’s possible reinstatement and settlement. Mahlangu says he had no independent recollection of the two emails that he had sent to Gigaba regarding the Gama matter at the time of his initial affidavit to the commission. He made the revelation in his supplementary statement to the Commission after he was implicated by former Transnet legal head Siyabulela Mapoma. Mahlangu was responding to questions posed by Advocate Anton Myburg at the State Capture Inquiry in Johannesburg. “In fact what the emails show … [is] that you have no independent recollection, is that you had had a series of discussions with Mr Mkwanazi, you had reported on those discussions to your boss, and in fact you had given your boss advice in relation to them, is that correct? That is correct.” The video below is today’s live stream:
