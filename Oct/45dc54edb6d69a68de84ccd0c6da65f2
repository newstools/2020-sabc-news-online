Enlightened Christian Church pastor Shepherd Bushiri, his wife Mary and three other co-accused Landiwe Ntlokwana, Willah and Zetu Mudolo, are on Monday scheduled to continue their bail application in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. The group is charged with fraud to the tune of R100 million, money laundering and the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Scores of Bushiri’s supporters are expected to flock to the court again to show support for the man they regard as their spiritual father. Bushiri and his co-accused, his wife Mary and Landiwe Ntlokwana, spent the weekend in custody at the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre after their bail application was postponed to Monday.
