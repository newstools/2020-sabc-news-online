The Department of Mineral Resources has welcomed the second significant discovery of gas by its offshore exploration rig off the Southern Cape coast. Ministry Spokesperson, Natie Shabangu, says the gas was discovered by the Deep-Sea Stavanger, which is currently drilling in the Luiperd Field, 182 kilometres from Mossel Bay. The same rig was successful after drilling in the nearby Brulpadda field last year. Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe, said last week that a positive gas haul would help boost the economy. Shabangu agrees, “The minister described this discovery as a game changer. He further welcomed the employment of 195 South African professionals during the exploration. The minister congratulates Total and its partners for a successful project. We are hopeful that we will see more investments in this sector in order to grow our economy in line with the economic reconstruction and recovery plan.” WE WELCOME THE DISCOVERY OF GAS CONDENSATE IN LUIPERD EXPLORATION We congratulate @Total & its partners on a successful project.
