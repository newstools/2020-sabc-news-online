Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu says government is committed to dealing with farm attacks because failure to do so would threaten food security. The Cabinet met this week to discuss the latest developments in the country following widespread protests in Senekal in the Free State. A farm worker was killed, leading to public violence during the court appearance by the two suspects in the murder case of 21-year-old farm manager Brendin Horner. Farmers in the Free State call for the return of the death penalty:  The EFF also took to Senekal to express its unhappiness at what it called the vandalism of public property. Mthembu says government is fast-tracking the implementation of the revised rural safety strategy to ensure that food security is not compromised. “A threat, not only to farmworkers and owners but also the country’s food security. Government is fast-tracking the implementation of the revised rural safety strategy to respond to the security needs of rural communities and support socio-economic development,” adds the minister.
