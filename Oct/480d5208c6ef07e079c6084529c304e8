Members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) working at the Gautrain have embarked on an indefinite strike. They’re picketing at the Midrand depot of the company that runs the Gautrain, Bombela Operations Company, demanding an 8% wage increase. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says the company has offered a 4% increase without engaging or negotiating with them. “At the heart of the strike is the fact that management doesn’t want to meaningfully engage with us as the employees. They are trying to impose a 4.1% increase; our members are demanding an 8% increase. We believe very strongly as Numsa that between us and the management of Gautrain that we can find one another, we are not that far from each other. We need an opportunity to engage meaningfully.” Our members are picketing outside the Gautrain depot in Midrand as part of the #GautrainStrike
