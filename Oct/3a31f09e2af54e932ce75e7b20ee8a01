The Chairperson of the parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) Mkhuleko Hlengwa says the committee will have to discuss the content of the letter sent by United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader,  Bantu Holomisa. Holomisa requested in his letter for the committee to investigate if there is a need for the establishment of a competent judiciary commission of an inquiry to probe a possible misconduct at Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). Hlengwa who has since confirmed the receipt of the document says among other things-the committee will have first to look if the issues Holomisa has raised fall within the ambit of the committee to ensure that the rules of parliament are complied with. ” I will be ensuring that members of the committee receive that correspondence in order for the committee to discuss it and make a determination on the content, merits and demerits of what retired general Holomisa has raised. We will of course have to make a determination on whether the issues he has raised are within the competency of the committee and in this regard-we will be consulting with the parliamentary legal services to advice and give guidance. “
