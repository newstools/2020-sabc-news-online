Supporters of the leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering church pastor Shepherd Bushiri are back at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court where he and his wife, Mary, are due to appear shortly. The couple and three other accused are expected to find out if they will be granted bail. They are charged with fraud to the tune of more than R100 million, money laundering and the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crimes Act. Proceedings ran longer than expected on Monday and the court adjourned. The legal representatives of the Bushiri’s wanted the application to resume on Tuesday. However, the magistrate in the case was not available until Friday. The Bushiri’s are also facing another trial in May 2021, also related to fraud and money laundering.
