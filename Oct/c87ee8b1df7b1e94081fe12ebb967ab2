The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has reiterated its call for the reversal of Ranjeni Munusamy’s appointment to the Department of Finance. The party says Munusamy is a compromised former political journalist because her name came up frequently at the State Capture Commission. EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu says the party has sent a letter to Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, articulating its demand. However, Mboweni has defended Munusamy’s employment, saying it’s his prerogative to make appointments to the ministry and that is outlined in the ministerial hand-book. Shivambu says, if needs be, they will take this matter to the Public Protector for further investigation. “There is nothing that she is doing there, except the private work of Tito Mboweni which I’m sure later on will come up when he responds to the letter we sent him. And if he doesn’t discontinue that relationship, we are going to explore a variety of options that include going to the Public Protector, the Public Service Commission to check even if the appointment was procedural.” Munusamy’s appointment questioned:  In 2019, a witness at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry accused Munusamy of having benefitted from the misappropriation of the Crime Intelligence slush fund. At the time, she requested permission to cross-examine the witness and abandoned the bid. She also used to manage the Friends of the Jacob Zuma page. The DA has also called on the Finance Minister to reconsider his decision on the former journalist.
