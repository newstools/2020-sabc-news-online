Two schools in Britstown in the Northern Cape have been closed following an outbreak of the Coronavirus at both schools. 38 teachers and learners at the Van Rensburg Primary School and Theron High School tested positive for the virus with others still awaiting the results of their COVID-19 tests. The teachers and learners at the schools tested positive for COVID-19 after allegedly attending a farewell function with a teacher who had contracted the virus. In a statement the provincial education department said it had instructed both schools to close for deep cleaning and called the outbreak unfortunate. The schools are expected to reopen on October 19, 2020. COVID-19 effects in schools to be felt for at least three years: Motshekga Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has warned that the effects of the coronavirus pandemic will be with schools for at least three years. She says although they have trimmed down the curriculum, learners will only finish about 70% of the work they are supposed to do this year. The remaining 30% will be incorporated into next year’s curriculum, and the work not finished in 2021 will be carried over to 2022. She says they plan to have the curriculum back to normal in three years’ time. Motsekga says it would have been a catastrophe if the school year was completely lost. “Honestly, it would have been catastrophic. For me, it’s even catastrophic as it is to have especially poor kids who do not have access to reading materials and ICT access at home. Since March up to now, they have not been going to school. For me, it’s a disaster. Even when we had trimmed the curriculum we still won’t be able to clawback what we lost. So it’s a disaster. So I think we should clawback the little that we can.”
