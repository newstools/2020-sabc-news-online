Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Blade Nzimande has condemned a shooting incident, which claimed the life of the head of the infrastructure development at the Coastal TVET college in KwaMakhutha, on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Lindinkosi Mazibuko was shot dead on Friday in the staff parking lot by an unknown assailant, who disappeared after the incident. The department says the incident follows another shooting of three students from the college a week ago. Smanga Zulu was killed in that incident. Department spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi says: “The Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Dr Blade Nzimande, passes his heartfelt condolences to Mr Lindinkosi Mazibuko’s family, friends and the entire Coastal TVET College community in KwaZulu-Natal. Minister Nzimande urges law enforcement agencies to act decisively and swiftly in arresting the perpetrators of this inhumane and shameful act against Mr Mazibuko.” Minister Nzimande urges anyone with information on the suspect’s whereabouts to contact the police. “Minister Nzimande also calls upon members of the community who might have information that leads to the arrest of these criminals to contact the KwaMakhutha SAPS,” says Mnisi.
