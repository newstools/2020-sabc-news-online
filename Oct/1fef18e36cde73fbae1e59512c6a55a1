The Hawks say two more suspects, in the case involving Durban businessman Thoshan Panday, are still at large. Warrants of arrest have been issued for the suspects. This relates to a fraudulent 2010 World Cup police accommodation tender, worth R47 million. The controversial businessman, together with Police Colonel, Navin Madhoe, appeared earlier in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on fraud charges. Panday was released on R100 000 bail. While former KZN Police Commissioner, Mammonye Ngobeni’s name appears on the charge sheet she was not in court with her fellow accused. Hawks Investigating Directorate Spokesperson, Sindisiwe Twala, has called on the two suspects to hand themselves over. “Two people appeared before the Durban Magistrate’s Court today. Their names are businessman Thoshan Panday and Colonel Navin Madhoe. They have been released on bail while Madhoe was granted R10 000 bail. Both accused are among the four whose warrants of arrest had already been issued. However, the other two are still at large. The suspects have been charged in relation to allegation of defrauding the SAPS by hugely inflating the prices of accommodation for police members during the World Cup. The subsequent attempts to bribe the policers are also central component now before court. That the other two suspects who are still at large need to make arrangements to appear before a police station in order for them to be formally charged.”
