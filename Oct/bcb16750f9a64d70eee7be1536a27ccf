The Councillor of Ward 33 in Samora Machel in Phillipi on the Cape Flats, Sithembiso Mzobe, says residents complaints about a lack of basic services in a new area known as the Eyadini informal settlement are justified. A group of former backyard dwellers is currently squatting on the land owned by rail agency PRASA. On Saturday Samora Machel residents accused their local ward councillor of failing to listen to the concerns:  Residents blame Mzobe for not helping them to get proper toilets and electricity in their area. But, Mzobe says he’s trying his best to solve the problem although the complaining residents’ area doesn’t fall under his ward. “Those issues are relevant because those issues are reported to the officials, to the council and the council didn’t help us when I spoke with them last week. The sub-council manager and I asked them, the roads need to be fixed and she answered that there is money allocated, the roads must be fixed and I asked when I didn’t even get an answer, I spoke the officials but it didn’t help.”
