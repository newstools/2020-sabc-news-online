A motivational campaign to help matric learners in their final push towards their National Senior Certificate exams has been launched by the Western Cape Education Department. COVID-19 has disrupted the academic year and stimulated online learning. Provincial Education MEC, Debbie Schafer, says the #CommitToFinish campaign aims to encourage, motivate and support Grade 12 learners up until their final exams. The exams are scheduled to start on 5 November. “It focuses on the future you, an older version on you, an older version of the matriculant thanking the younger version for making the right choice to finish their matric. Past experience has shown that some learners become despondent following their trial exams and may make the decision to drop out. This choice will change their life and the life of those around them, hence the campaign line… You will thank yourself,” says Schafer.

Basic Education (@DBE_SA) October 2, 2020  Earlier this year, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga launched the Matric Catchup programme that will make use of various broadcast platforms to help learners. Four hours of lessons will be available on television every day. Matric learners can catch the programmes on the SABC, DStv and Open View channels. Motshekga said that the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has forced her department to find innovative ways of reaching learners. “This ladies and gentlemen means a four hour broadcast of the curriculum content for matriculants every day from 1 September to 30 November 2020. There will also be interactive exam preparations during and after holidays. This catchup campaign has sourced high quality curriculum content.” The video below is on the Woza Matrics, free catch-up TV initiative:
