Political analyst professor Somadoda Fikeni has warned that the credibility of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture would be dented if it were to succumb to former President Jacob Zuma’s demands. Zuma’s legal team has written a letter requesting for Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo to recuse himself as the chairperson of the commission accusing him of being biased against their client. Zuma believes that Zondo cannot give him a fair hearing in his next appearance which is due next month. Fikeni says Zuma’s move is not surprising. “If you look at the legal challenges of President Zuma including the one of the Arms Deal, it’s the same Modus Operandi to fight it to the end and yet present to the public that you get your day in court and also when the public starts making allegations of you being implicated you say but the courts have not yet found me guilty. I do think you’d still have a situation where it continues, of course, it would suffer huge credibility challenge in a sense but I don’t think it would come undone.” In the video below, Jacob Zuma wants Justice Zondo to recuse himself:
