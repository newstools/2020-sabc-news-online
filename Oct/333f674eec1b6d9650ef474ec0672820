Supporters of President Donald Trump waved US and campaign flags on Sunday outside the military hospital where he is being treated for COVID-19. Trump, who was taken to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre on Friday, released a four-minute video on Saturday in which he said he felt better and the “real test” of his conditionwill come over the next few days. Trump’s illness has upended the campaign ahead of the November presidential election and cast a spotlight on the president’s handling of the pandemic. The Republican president is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls. Trump’s video came after differing assessments of his health from administration officials on Saturday left it unclear how ill the president had become since he tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday night. President Donald Trump says “real test” ahead in his COVID-19 fight:  A White House team of doctors said on Saturday morning Trump’s condition was improving and that he was already talking about returning to the White House.  Within minutes, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave reporters a less rosy assessment, saying, “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.” Meadows, whose initial comments were delivered on condition that he not be identified, altered his tone hours later, telling Reuters that Trump was doing “very well” and that “doctors are very pleased with his vital signs.” Meadows did not clarify the discrepancy in his comments. A Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said the president was not happy to learn of Meadows’ initial remarks. Administration officials have described the move to Walter Reed as precautionary and said Trump would stay for several days.
