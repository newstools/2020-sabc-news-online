Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and party MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi are back at the Randburg Magistrates Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday for an assault case. It was meant to resume earlier this month where policeman Johannes Venter was to give evidence. Venter laid a charge of assault against Malema and Ndlozi after they allegedly assaulted him during the funeral of the late struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 2018. The trial was postponed to allow the media to carry the court proceedings live. EFF members are expected to gather outside court in support of their leaders. Trial proceedings to be broadcast live During their previous court appearance, Malema said he would not allow Venter to testify without media presence. The court has since approved an application to broadcast the trial live as it continues today. There was an altercation inside the courtroom as some members of AfriForum refused to make way for the media houses that were there to listen to the proceedings. Malema and some of the party’s top leadership tried to force the AfriForum members out of the court, but officials intervened and sorted the scuffle. Addressing members of the EFF outside the court, Malema said Venter must apologise to them for what happened during Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral in 2018. He said even the state owes them an apology because it was disrespectful for their name to be dragged in the mud, as seen in the video below: CIC Julius Malema Appearance At Randburg Magistrate Court https://t.co/pcs2wCsGXA — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) October 13, 2020
