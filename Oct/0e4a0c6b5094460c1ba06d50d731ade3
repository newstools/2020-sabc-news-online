The case against 13 suspects, including nine police officers and a company, charged in the multi-million rand police warning lights tender scandal has been postponed to November. Former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is among the accused. On Monday, another high-ranking police official was nabbed in a pre-dawn raid. Deputy National Commissioner for Human Resources management, Bonang Mgwenya, appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrate Court and has been granted R20 000 bail. Mgwenya faces charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering. According to the National Prosecuting Authority, Mgwenya enjoyed a close relationship with the owner of Instrumentation for Traffic Law Enforcement (Pty) Ltd, Vimpie Manthata. His company had won the tender. The group stands accused of colluding to ensure that the firm was awarded a contract to install 1 555 police motor vehicles with warning lights at an inflated price. The state alleges that during the procurement process, the accused ignored the competitive bidding process and committed SAPS to financial exposure of R191 million in favour of Manthata’s company in exchange for benefits they received. The company is said to have been paid R65 million and another payment of R22 million was halted amid a probe into the deal. The accused are expected back in court on the 16th of November.
