President Ramaphosa answers questions in NCOP:  On the Prasa matter, President Ramaphosa says government will deploy drones and armed response to conduct virtual patrols as part of a R900 million security plan to protect the infrastructure of the Passenger Rail Agency. He has told the NCOP that the vandalism and sabotage of rail infrastructure is one of the worst economic crimes in the country. He says it has a direct impact on the lives of millions of South Africans who rely on the commuter rail service to travel to work or to study. He says an e-guarding solution will be introduced for the protection of critical assets such as substations, relay rooms, and communication sites. “Part of the plan is to immediately appoint security personnel and to deploy remotely piloted aircraft systems to conduct virtual patrols of high risk infrastructure. This capability will work together with specialised investigations and armed response.”
