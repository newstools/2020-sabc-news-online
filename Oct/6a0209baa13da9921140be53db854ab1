The legal representatives of the 45-year-old Cassious Sejake say the arrest of their client by the Hawks is a political ploy. Sejake was arrested on Monday at the Ratlou Local Municipality offices. He is facing four counts of contravention of Municipal Finance Management Act for allegedly awarding four tenders worth R5 million in the 2018/2019 financial year. He was the acting municipal manager then. It was a busy morning for the Hawks, as they arrested the former acting municipal manager of the Ratlou Local Municipality. Cassius Sejake arrested by the Hawks:  He was formally charged at the local police station. Subsequent to that, the accused appeared briefly at the Atamelang Magistrate’s Court. However, his lawyer Bongani Siziwe says this is nothing but a stunt. “Now, this postponement tomorrow in particular will enable (us) to gather all evidence including all the administrator’s reports, all the investigation report, all the High Court orders he has obtained against the Ratlou Local Municipality to demonstrate to the magistrate (who) will be hearing this matter, to demonstrate to him that this is just a political plot by certain law enforcement agencies to try and embarrass him,” says Siziwe. However, Hawks Spokesperson in North West, Tlangelani Rikhotso says the accused has been implicated in tender irregularities. “Processes were not followed in awarding of tenders. So, he was charged today under municipal finance management act where it means that he, as the accounting officer, for the municipality during the time he was acting he did not take necessary steps to ensure that there is no wasteful expenditure and processes where followed,” says Rikhotso. Sejake is expected to make a formal bail application on Tuesday in the Atamelang Magistrate’s Court. Hawks arrest senior official at Ratlou municipal official:
