The State Capture Commission in Johannesburg is hearing Transnet-related evidence from the former Managing Director of Rail at Hatch, Henk Bester, and also from the former Transnet Executive Management of Capital Development, Deidre Strydom. Earlier Bester told the State Capture Commission that he was approached by Gupta associate Salim Essa who wanted Hatch to include Essa’s company as a supplier partner for a Transnet Rail Project worth R27 billion. Bester says Essa demanded at the Melrose Arch meeting in April 2013 that he be partnered with Hatch for the Transnet business at a cost of R80 million.
