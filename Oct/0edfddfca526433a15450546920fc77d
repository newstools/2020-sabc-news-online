Two of the four people accused in the double murder of a Polokwane businesswoman and her mother have been denied bail by the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo. Magistrate Janine Ungerer said that Zimbabwean Casper Mudau might evade trial as he is in the country illegally. The magistrate also considered Sophie Mmako a flight risk as she has provided the police with more than two addresses. The remaining accused abandoned their bail application. The deceased, Lizette Deacon and Hettie were killed at their Welgelegen home in Polokwane last month. Their bodies were found found in the back of their abandoned vehicle on the R37 road. Magistrate Ungerer says the state has a strong case against the accused. “Applicant number one is illegal in the country. As regards to applicant two, the state case against her is very strong as well as the fact that she has several addresses and this court deems her to be a flight risk as well. There has been an outcry since the death of the deceased. The deceased were well known in Polokwane and there were also public demonstrations. These were heinous crimes committed against the deceased and this court is of the view that both are flight risk and thus bail for both accused are denied.” In the video below, suspects in court for murders of businesswoman and mother:
