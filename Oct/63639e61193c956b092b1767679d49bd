The Western Cape Health Department says they are preparing for a potential second wave of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The department says this follows several European countries reporting a rise in coronavirus cases for a second time. Despite South Africa’s recovery rate now standing at 90%, authorities are urging people against complacency and have called on them to continue adhering to health protocols. The Western Cape Health Department’s Chief of Operations, Dr Saadiq Kariem says, “We have to keep our surveillance systems up and running. The whole country will be concerned about the second wave, like what happened in many other cities and countries around the world. So we have to remain highly vigilant. I would advise that we learn lessons from the first wave and prepare ourselves for the second wave, if it does come.” Below is the full radio interview with Dr Kariem:  As of Sunday, the cumulative number of detected COVID-19 cases in South Africa stands at 681 289. The death toll has increased to 16 976 following the passing of 38 South Africans overnight. The majority of the deaths are from Gauteng with 37 residents having succumbed to the disease. One is from the Western Cape. The total number of recoveries is now at 614 781.
