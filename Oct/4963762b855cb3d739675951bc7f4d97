Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip in Parliament Natasha Mazzone has laid criminal charges against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Member of Parliament, Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, for inciting violence. This comes after Ndlozi sang the song “call the fire brigade, burn these Boers” at the EFF gathering in Senekal in the Free State during the court appearance of the two accused in the Brendin Horner murder case. Mazzone says her party will further approach the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) asking it to declare the song illegal. “I have just furnished laying charges of inciting violence against Dr Ndlozi, Member of Parliament, following his singing of the song talking about calling the fire brigade and setting the boer on fire. We are seeing massive fires erupting in the Free State. It may be concerning that these may be related. We are now going to approach the Human Rights Commission to ensure that singing setting the Boer on fire is also declared … [illegal],” adds Mazzone.
