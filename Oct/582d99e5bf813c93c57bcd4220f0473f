Pastor Timothy Omotoso remains a prohibited person in the country. The state prosecutor in the bail application of the pastor, Adv Nceba Ntelwa, confirmed it through an official from the Department of Home Affairs. This means Omotoso can be deported if he is granted bail. Omotosoâ€™s legal counsel, Adv Terry Price, argued that bail cannot be denied purely on him being a prohibited person as he has no legal documents or permits. Price says the court can issue an order with strict restrictions which could include an amount to be paid, house arrest and that he report to court for the trial. He says Omotoso will appeal the matter of being a prohibited person. Documentation was served on him three weeks ago. Omotoso is applying for bail in the Port Elizabeth high court. He is currently in custody while on trial with two co-accused, Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Solani, on several sex-related and human trafficking charges involving young women from his Jesus Dominion International Church. The bail hearing continues on Thursday. State is opposing bail:
