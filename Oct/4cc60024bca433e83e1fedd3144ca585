Worker representatives of SA Express have welcomed the extension of the embattled airline’s final provisional liquidation. The High Court in Johannesburg had granted SA Express an extension of nearly two months ending on Wednesday to conclude talks with potential investors to sell the state-owned airline. The airline owes creditors more than R2.5 billion. It has been in the airline business for about 26 years. Over 600 workers have not received their salaries since February this year due. Worker representative, Thabisile Sikhakhane, speaks for the workers. “We are quite happy with the extension as it gives the time to finalize the issues around the sale of SA Express. We are also quite happy that it gives our colleagues enough to conclude processes with the Human Rights Commission and others to finalize the payment of our salaries. The salaries we received was in February.” SA Express workers march to the Union Buildings:
