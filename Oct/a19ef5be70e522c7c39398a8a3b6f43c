Today marks the 43rd anniversary of Black Wednesday when the apartheid government banned 19 Black Consciousness organisations and several anti- government newspapers such as the World and the Weekend World on 19 October 1977. A number of events are planned for today, including the 10th Annual Percy Qoboza Memorial Lecture. Qoboza was the then editor of The World newspaper. Now to reflect on the importance of this day we are joined via Zoom by Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of Pretoria Professor Tawana Kupe.
