The State Capture Commission in Johannesburg is hearing Transnet-related evidence from the former Transnet Board Chairperson, Mafika Mkwanazi. Earlier, Mkwanazi conceded that he and his then board members acted irresponsibly in their decision to reinstated former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama following an inquiry which found Gama guilty of over 30 counts of misconduct. Mkwanazi denied that he was instructed by former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba to reinstate Gama. State Capture Commission proceedings:
