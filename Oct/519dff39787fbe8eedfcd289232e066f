A 15-year-old girl has allegedly been raped by her biological father and her suspected boyfriend in the Giyani area of Limpopo on separate occasions. The men aged 40 and 25 have been arrested. Police say the 40-year-old father first opened a statutory rape case against the suspected boyfriend. However, police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe says the father was then accused of raping the child since last year. “Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has strongly condemned the incident in which a 40-year-old biological father of a 15-year-old girl and the alleged boyfriend of this minor were on Tuesday arrested for rape and statutory rape. The incidents allegedly occurred separately from 2019 up to date. The suspects will appear before the Giyani Magistrate’s Court.” Many social issues have come under the spotlight as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown, and domestic violence is one that continues to impact thousands of South Africans who are confined to their homes. The spike in Gender-Based Violence (GBV) since the start of the lockdown has sent shockwaves across the country. In the first week alone, the South African Police Service (SAPS) recorded 2 300 complaints of GBV. However, many remain unreported.
