Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) pastor Shepherd Bushiri and his co-accused, his wife Mary as well as Landiwe Ntlokwana, will spend the weekend in custody at the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre after their bail application was postponed to Monday at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. Bushiri argued in court that he should be released on bail as he does not have any reason to try and evade the trial. His advocate, Annelene van den Heever, read out Bushiri’s affidavit. “I fail to appreciate why I would be a flight risk. I have no reason to run away, I have no reason to evade the trial as I know I have not committed any offence let alone the offence for which I should be in prison. I’m a very religious person living my life according to the strict principles of my religion. I’m a pastor of the Enlightened Christian Gatherings Church with a following of about 2.1 million members.” Prophet Shepherd and Mary Bushiri court hearing:
