South African police are now working with their Sudanese counterparts in an investigation that implicates South Africa’s deputy ambassador to Sudan in a double murder. Two women were killed in Zabantu Ngcobo’s apartment in Khartoum allegedly by the embassy’s driver and another local man. The arrested pair told Sudanese police that they were ordered to kill an intelligence official that is apparently sending bad reviews of Ngcobo back to Pretoria. International Relations spokesperson, Lunga Ngqengelele says they are aware of the situation which law enforcement is now handling in both countries.
