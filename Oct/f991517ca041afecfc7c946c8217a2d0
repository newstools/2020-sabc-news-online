The commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume on Monday, looking at allegations of corruption related to Denel. The commission is expected to hear evidence from former board member Nonyameko Mandindi. It is also expected to also hear evidence from the current chairperson, Monhla Hlahla. Mandindi and four other executives resigned in 2017 due to alleged allegations of corruption between Denel Asia joint venture with Gupta linked VR Asia. The board members were appointed in 2015 by then Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown as a rotation board. Other witnesses who appeared before the commission have alleged that the 2015 Denel board under former chairperson, Daniel Mantsha, was ill-equipped and made poor decisions for the state-owned entity that led to millions of losses.
