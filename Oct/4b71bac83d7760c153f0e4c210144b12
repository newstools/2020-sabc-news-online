“To accommodate delegates with no internet connectivity, we’ve provided 38 hybrid venues with WiFi and internet connectivity where these delegates can take part in this congress. We will be using the Zoom webinar poling system to vote for constitutional amendments as well as congress resolutions. For electing the new federal leadership we will be using the Opa voting system and we have tested this system in two provincial congresses, one in the Eastern Cape and one in Mpumalanga. This system was successfully tested and I have absolute confidence in the integrity of this system.” Both candidates for the leadership position have expressed confidence in winning the race.  The party’s former youth leader now KZN MPL, Mbali Ntuli said she has worked hard to reach many of the party’s delegates. Current interim leader, John Steenhuisen, says he is certain he has ticked all the boxes to garner favour from the majority of the voting delegates.  Political Analyst Aubrey Matshiqi believes that the party will have its work cut out in dealing with issues it faces. Two other positions will be contested at the congress. Gauteng Chair Mike Moriarty is challenging Helen Zille for the powerful position of the DA Federal Council Chair. Other four candidates including Refiloe Ntsheke, Anton Bredell, Annelie Lotriet  and Jacques Smalle are vying for the position of third deputy Federal Chair. The congress was postponed earlier in the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. – Report by Nomalizo Mandela
