Hundreds of thousands of litres of alcohol will literally go down the drain across Gauteng in the next two weeks. Gauteng police say they will dispose of alcohol confiscated following the contravention of lockdown regulations and other laws. They say most of the storage rooms in the province are packed to capacity with confiscated liquor. Gauteng Police Commissioner Elias Mawela says, “We have more than 300 000 litres of alcohol. It differs from one suburb, township and informal settlement. In the township, you would find this. It’s Nigerian liquor, but it’s here in the country illegally. When it comes to pricing it’s difficult for me to give the price, but it’s worth millions of rands.” The video below shows the alcohol being disposed of:
