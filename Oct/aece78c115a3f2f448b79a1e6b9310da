The Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Gauteng has ordered that all cameras filming the live court proceedings involving Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leaders Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlovu to be switched off. Magistrate Lieland Poonsamy told camera operators to switch the cameras off after one of the operators had his phone ring in court. This means all media houses will not be able to carry the trial live. Malema, Ndlozi back in court

Police Colonel Johannes Venter has been giving evidence on what happened the day he was allegedly assaulted by Ndlozi and Malema during the funeral of the late struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 2018. “In a shocking turn of events, the magistrate ordered the cameras be switched off. This after the trial was postponed to today to allow the media to make applications to be allowed to stream the court proceedings. Colonel Johannes Venter continues to be cross-examined by Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi’s legal team on how he was assaulted by the two. It’s not yet clear whether the media will be allowed back in court tomorrow as this trial will be continuing.” CIC Julius Malema and Commissar Mbuyiseni Ndlozi Appeareance at Randurg Magistrate Court https://t.co/qK4lod2TmL — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) October 28, 2020  EFF Deputy President @FloydShivambu says our message is simple: Venter is not here to seek justice, he is here to pursue a political agenda of AfriForum. #HandsOffCIC pic.twitter.com/1Gna30lFLs — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) October 28, 2020  [MUST WATCH]: Deputy President @FloydShivambu updating Fighters outside on the case against our CIC @Julius_S_Malema.
