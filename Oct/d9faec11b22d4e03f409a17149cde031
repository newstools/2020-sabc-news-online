Former SABC News anchor Palesa Chubisi wants her dismissal to be set aside. Chubisi made an urgent application in the Labour Court in Braamfontein, Johannesburg earlier today, to have the termination of her contract declared void and invalid. She’s among a group of employees that the public broadcaster fired last week. The SABC said it had found that the group had unduly benefited from promotions and jobs. The SABC argued that the matter was not urgent and Chubisi could have approached the CCMA, therefore this matter should be dismissed with costs. Chubisi argues through her lawyer, William Mukhari that the SABC‘s decision to dismiss her is unlawful and wants to be reinstated with immediate effect. The SABC argues that the dismissal was based on the Public Protector’s report, as well as its own internal investigation which found she was among almost 30 employees who were appointed or promoted without due process by former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The Judge asked why the SABC opted for an outright dismissal after it had informed Chubisi when she was invited to make representations that her previous position was still available. The SABC says that position is no longer available. Chubisi’s lawyer says her client should have at least been given other options.
