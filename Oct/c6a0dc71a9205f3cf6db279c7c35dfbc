In August 2020, the Right2Know organisation calliedon the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to speed up the prosecutions of all those implicated in the Marikana massacre. In August marked eight years since the tragedy occurred, where 34 mineworkers were gunned down by the police at a Lonmin Platinum Mine during a strike. More than 200 others were injured. The incident was described as the deadliest use of force by the police in South Africa, since the 1976 Soweto June 16 uprisings:  In a statement, Right2Know said: “We have seen hardly no one whatsoever, being held to account for the massacre that remains a painful dent on our young democracy.” Adding that: “We remain committed to challenging the establishment for the increase in the militarised policing response of the police towards protests and dissent in our country since the Marikana massacre. We cannot continue to have protesters suffering injuries and at times death at the hands of those who are meant to serve and protect them.”
