He was appointed by former Eskom Chairperson Zola Tsotsi to conduct an independent inquiry which resulted in the suspension of four senior Eskom executives including former CEO Tshediso Matona. Tsotsi who gave evidence at the commission last month alleged that former President Jacob Zuma instructed him to appoint Linnell to implement the inquiry. Linnell is alleged to have had close ties with Dudu Myeni, a close friend of  Zuma.

He was suspended in March 2015 and later left the power utility. Matona had told the Eskom Inquiry he did not know what was happening nor take any action when he signed off critical coal contracts in 2015 – some linked to the Gupta family. Matona is expected to shed more light on what happened at the power utility when he was CEO and what allegations were levelled against him when he was suspended. It was during his tenure that the former Gupta owned New Age Media secured a R43 million sponsorship deal from Eskom.  The CEO was cleared of all wrongdoing by the Eskom Inquiry.
