The Senekal Magistrate’s Court in the Free State has heard that there is no physical evidence that links the accused to the murder of young farm manager Brendin Horner. Horner was killed on a Farm in Paul Roux, his body was found with a rope around his neck and tied to a pole. The lawyers representing murder accused Sekwetje Mahlamba and Sekola Matlaletsa have told the court that murder allegations against their clients are baseless and the two didn’t commit the murder. The lawyers have been cross-examining the investigating officer – Gerhardus Myburgh – following his testimony that the release of the accused on bail will create unrest in Paul Roux and surrounding areas. Defence lawyer  Machini Motloung says he has trust in the country’s law enforcement agencies to maintain law and order.  Earlier, Myburgh said DNA test results of samples taken from the accused are still outstanding. The bail application is still underway. The state is opposing bail on the grounds that if the two are released on bail it would cause a public outcry. Myburgh has told the court that he is of the view that the accused might interfere with witnesses if they are released. The brutal murder of 21-year-old farm manager Brendin Horner has stirred emotions in the farming community.
