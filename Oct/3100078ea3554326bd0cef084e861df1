The bail application of Pastor Timothy Omotoso has been postponed to next week Monday, following a brief appearance in the Port Elizabeth high court on Friday morning. The postponement is due to a witness for the defence not being available on Friday and the other witness is only being available on Monday. The case resumed on Tuesday but has still not gained much momentum with Judge Phillip Zilwa saying that it has become messy.
