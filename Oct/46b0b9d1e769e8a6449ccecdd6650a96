The Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank (TDB) has donated US$500,000 to support COVID-19 response across Africa by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The donation is being made to the African Union through the COVID-19 Response Fund as part of TDB’s COVID-19 Emergency Response Programme (CERP). With this contribution, TDB, alongside a group of multilateral, sovereign, private sector and philanthropic partners, contributes to the implementation of the Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak, which aims to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19 infections in African Union Member States, and minimize social disruption and economic consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks. In a statement, President and Chief Executive of TDB, Admassu Tadesse says, “It is our duty to respond to African Union’s call for solidarity to address today’s greatest global public health crisis. The pooling of resources and fusion of efforts of global and African institutions is certainly crucial to halting the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact on the health and socio-economic situation of our peoples. We commend the African Union for bringing African countries together to act as one, with more power and greater effectiveness.” Below is the full statement:
