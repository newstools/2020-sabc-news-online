Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) President Velenkosini Hlabisa has described as disappointing President Cyril Ramaphosa’s economic recovery plan. Hlabisa was opening the party’s Gauteng provincial workshop to map out a game plan for the 2021 local government elections. He says that the President’s plan presented no new ideas.. The IFP in Gauteng will be seeking to increase its less than one percent support garnered in the province in the 2019 national elections. Its traditional support is scattered across Soweto and the hostels located along the industrial and mining belt of central Johannesburg. “We were expecting the President of our country to be specific that we have so much money that is available now and as from next week we will see action, not plans. We will see action in this particular industry so many will be employed in this particular industry. We were expecting specifics with timelines unfortunately plan after plan” Hlabisa says South African’s should be prioritised for all job opportunities. He says that given the dire economic situation that the country finds itself in, jobs must be preserved for citizens first. He says there is nothing xenophobic about prioritising citizens: “The economic situation of this country is getting overstretched as it is already broken down. It is our view that every job opportunity should prioritise South Africans. Yes on specialised skills that we do not have as a country,  we warmly welcome and say that opportunity should be given to every person that is within the borders of our country.” Ramaphosa said the implementation for the plan will raise growth to around three-percent in the next ten years.
