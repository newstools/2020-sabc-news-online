The Mpianzi family lawyer, Wikus Steyl, says although the family welcomes the dismissal of the principal of Parktown Boys in Johannesburg, they still feel the truth remains elusive about what happened to their son, Enoch, in his final days leading to his tragic death at a school camp at Nyathi Bush River Break in Brits in January this year. The grade 8 learner drowned after his makeshift raft capsized in a strong current. Mpianzi’s body was only discovered the next morning. Steyl says the family is going ahead with the criminal case against the school, the principal, the governing body, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, and management of the camping site where the boy died. “The family still feels that they do not know the true facts of what happened on the Wednesday of Enoch dying and the Friday when his body was discovered. The family is hoping that even though those circumstances are not in the report … the family’s satisfaction that either in the civil or criminal case they will finally find closure and know how Enoch spent the last few hours and the last days of his life,” adds Steyl.
