A former KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner and a police captain are expected to hand themselves to the police in Durban on Monday. This after the Hawks had obtained a warrant of arrest for the two. Two others, Durban businessman Thoshan Panday and police Colonel Navin Madhoe, were arrested and appeared in court on Friday on fraud and corruption charges linked to a R47-million tender in 2010. The tender related to police accommodation during the FIFA World Cup. Panday and Madhoe were granted bail of R100 000 and R10 000 respectively. NPA spokesperson Sipho Ngwema says, “Indeed the investigating Directorate has two outstanding warrants of arrest, one for a police captain and former police commissioner in KZN. This is in connection with a R47 million corruption matter – which is connected to the World Cup 2010 activities in KwaZulu-Natal.” The video below is on the warrants of arrest:
