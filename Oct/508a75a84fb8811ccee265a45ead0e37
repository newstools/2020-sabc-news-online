The woman accusing Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng interim leader, Solly Msimanga of sexual assault says Msimanga must step aside from his duties until he proves his innocence. DA Gauteng MPL Nkele Molapo opened a sexual assault case against Msimanga after she lodged a complaint with the party earlier this month. Molapo says she has lost confidence in the party’s internal disciplinary measures after it failed to acknowledge her complaint. She was allegedly harassed by Msimanga in 2014. Msimanga has since refuted the allegations and opened a case of crimen injuria against Molapo. Molapo believes party procedure must also be applied with this matter. “There are precedents, so when I was accused of leaking the screen shot, even before I was charged, I was suspended from all caucus activities. I had to campaign for 2019 whilst not being a member of my caucus. When the last constitutionally elected mayor of Tshwane [Stevens Mokgalapa] was accused of having what sounded like a consensual intercourse, he was then taken for DC and is no longer mayor,” explains Molapo. “So I actually expected that to happen with the accused now because there’s been a precedent. This is how we do things. Why are we doing things differently when it comes to him,” adds Molapo. In the video below, Msimang denies the allegations:
