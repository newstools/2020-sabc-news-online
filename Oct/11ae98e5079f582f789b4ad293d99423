Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane says the Dawid Kruiper Municipality in the Northern Cape must reverse the appointments of three officials within 30 days as they were irregular. This follows complaints that the three officials who were appointed in 2016 were given positions without following proper procedures. The Public Protector’s spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says the appointments resulted in irregular expenditure. “Upon investigating, the public protector confirmed all of these allegations that what was alleged by Mr Van der Steen was in fact what happened. And therefore some of the evidence that came up during the investigation was that these positions were never advertised. The recruitment and selection process which is prescribed by the municipal policy for that purpose was not followed,” explains Segalwe.
