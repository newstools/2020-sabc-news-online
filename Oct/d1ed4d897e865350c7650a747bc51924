Two siblings have been arrested for allegedly leading a mob justice incident in which a man was assaulted and set alight at Mashavhela village, outside Giyani, in Limpopo, last week. This brings the number of suspects to 22. The men were accused of the disappearance and death of 25-year-old, Mahlori Maluleke, whose body was discovered hanging from a tree in the nearby bushes. Police Spokesperson, Moatshe Ngoepe, says the two additional suspects are Maluleke’s siblings. “We can confirm that the police in Giyani have arrested two more suspects who are the families of the late Mahlori Maluleke who was found hanging last week. These suspects will appear before the Giyani Magistrate’s Court soon on a charge of murder.” Meanwhile, the Spokesperson for the Maluleke family, Matimu Maluleke, has accused the police of harassment. “The police have decided to arrest my brother and my sister. They are saying that the man who was burned has pointed out (sic) their names as the culprits. They called my brother telling him that there are documents that need to be signed. So, they arrested him. After doing that, they came here with many many vans to come and arrest my sister. So, that’s a case of harassment.”
