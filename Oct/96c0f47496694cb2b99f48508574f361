The Western Cape government has dismissed social media messages, alleging a spike in coronavirus infections in the province as fake news. Premier, Alan Winde, says they’ve become aware of certain messages being shared on social media platforms. Winde says the province continues to record an average COVID-19 test positivity rate below 10%. He says hospital admissions make up just 5% of the total number of people hospitalised in the province. #FakeNews is spreading regarding Groote Schuur Hospital #coronavirus cases.
