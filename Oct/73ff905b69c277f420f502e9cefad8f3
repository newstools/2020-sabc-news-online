About 13 nine-millimetre pistol and R5 rifle cartridges were found at Lonmin’s K3 shaft in Marikana, when five men were killed on 13 August 2012. This was revealed by Lieutenant Colonel Moses Mushwana, who was giving testimony regarding role in the police’s local crime recording unit. This emerged in the Mahikeng High Court where former North West Deputy Police Commissioner, Major-General William Mpembe and five others are facing charges including murder and attempted murder, relating to the Marikana massacre eight years ago. Old wounds opened at the Marikana trial:  The 25th witness, Moses Mushwana, who is attached to the local Crime Recording Centre in Rustenburg, attended two scenes where he says he saw two bodies of mineworkers and those of two police officers. This was on the 13th August 2012. According to his observation, the bodies had multiple stab and gunshot wounds. He says he also took blood swabs from a knobkierrie and from a home-made spear. Mushwana is expected to be cross-examined by legal representatives for the former North West Deputy Police Commissioner William Mpembe and his five co-accused, when the case continues on Tuesday. They allegedly chased after and shot at a group of mine workers who reportedly stole an R5 rifle from a police officer. One mineworker was killed. The six men have pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them. The trial continues. Remembering Marikana Massacre | Advocate Dali Mpofu
