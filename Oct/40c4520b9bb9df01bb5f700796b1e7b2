Former Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku’s lawyer says his client wants to have his name cleared following a damning report by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) regarding a multi-million rand Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender scandal. Masuku was fired from his position earlier this month, after the preliminary report was released. Masuku and Presidency spokesperson, Khusela Diko, are now facing an African National Congress (ANC) disciplinary hearing over the scandal, which involves Diko’s husband. Masuku’s legal representative, Mojalefa Motalane, has filed for an urgent court application in the High Court in Pretoria to have the findings of the SIU report set aside. It found Masuku to have failed to execute his duties, thus violating the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act (PMFA). “What our client is primarily focused on is to set the record straight and to basically dismiss the findings made by the SIU, as I have said they are not factual. It has caused quite considerable damage to his reputation and integrity and the primary purpose of the application is to clarify the wrongful aspects that were made by the SIU,” says Motalane. Diko, Masuku to appear before disciplinary committee over PPE tender fraud:  Motalane says their objections are primarily to the report and  would like to call it a letter as they don’t believe the SIU has issued a report. Their objection is based on the findings that the MEC has breached his constitutional duties and obligations and certain provisions of the PFMA in carrying out his duties – which they do not believe is the case – based on “irrational” findings and determinations by the SIU.
