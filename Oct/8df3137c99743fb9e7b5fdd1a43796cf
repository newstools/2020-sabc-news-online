The joint operational team at OR Tambo International Airport enhanced its interventions both proactively and re-actively.” “Since then these types of incidents started to show a steady decline with no cases reported in the last few months. The conviction and sentencing of these two men will serve as a huge deterrent to other such would-be criminals.” Meanwhile, in July seven suspects appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court, east of Johannesburg, after being arrested during a robbery at OR Tambo International Airport.
