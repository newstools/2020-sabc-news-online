Video footage of August 2012 showing the Marikana Massacre incident is expected to be shown at the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Monday. Former North West deputy police commissioner William Mpembe and five co-accused are implicated in the Marikana killings. The accused are facing four murder charges, six of attempted murder, including defeating the ends of justice. They allegedly unlawfully while under oath, gave false information regarding Mpembe’s instructions to police officers to shoot striking miners with teargas canisters as well as stun grenades. The incident happened during the Lonmin Platinum mineworkers unprotected wage increase strike. On 16 August 2012, 34 mineworkers were shot and killed by the police at Wonderkop in Marikana, at a location known as the Kopie. Right2Know calls for speedy prosecution In August, the Right2Know organisation called on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to speed up the prosecutions of all those implicated in the Marikana massacre. The month also marked eight years since the tragedy occurred. “We have seen hardly anyone whatsoever, being held to account for the massacre that remains a painful dent on our young democracy,” said Right2Know in a statement. The incident has been described as the deadliest use of force by the police in South Africa, since the 1976 Soweto June 16 uprisings. The video below outlines more of what is expected during the trial:
