The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is adamant that it has a strong case against the five men accused of the murder of soccer star Senzo Meyiwa and says more arrests are imminent. Soweto Mandlanzi, author of soccer star’s biography, fears for his life

Earlier today, Themba Sibiya, Bongani Ntanzi, Mthobisi Ncube, Mthokozisi Maphisa and Sifiso Ntuli appeared in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court east of Johannesburg. This is a good case, but some work still needs to be done: Sipho Ngwema, NPA

They’ve been charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery with aggravated circumstances and possession of ammunition and unlicensed firearms. Some of the accused are serving prison sentences while others are awaiting trial for separate crimes. The case has been postponed to the 27th of next month. The NPA’s Sipho Ngwema has also called for the responsible handling of a document, naming Meyiwa’s girlfriend Kelly Khumalo, which was erroneously sent to the media. Murder case postponed to the 27th November 2020, prosecution document leaked:

“We owe it to the family. We owe it to the football community. We owe it to all South Africans that those who killed Senzo must pay. But if we mishandle documents and people get free on a technicality, then we are all complicit in the murder of Senzo. So, we need to act responsibly and we need to make sure that we do our work responsibly and ethically.”
