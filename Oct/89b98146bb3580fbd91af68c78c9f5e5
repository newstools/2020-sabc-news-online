An East London couple were nabbed by the Hawks for alleged tax fraud amounting to R2.6 million. Momgezi Mayizole and his wife, Eunice appeared in court before being released on a warning. Hawks spokesperson Lwando Zenzile says it is alleged that the couple presented themselves as tax practitioners assisting people with filing their tax returns, which gave them access to the SARS e-filing accounts of their victims. The state alleges that they would submit fraudulent information resulting in unlawful refunds and then demanding a 10 percent payment on each refund. The case has been remanded to January 13, 2021 for further investigations.
