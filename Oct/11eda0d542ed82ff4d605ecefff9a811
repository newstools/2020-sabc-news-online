Arms manufacturer, Denel’s former non-executive Board director, Nonyameko Mandindi, says that she was taken aback when certain items were mysteriously added to the agendas of Board meetings. Mandindi is testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. Mandindi who was appointed to the Denel Board by the former Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown resigned in 2016. She says they were asked to hand over cellphones and were given tablets on which most of the information was given back to the company. Commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo sought more details from Mandindi: “During this meeting, questions were raised by certain Board members which were not part of the Board pack, as someone who reads Board packs meticulously I pointed out that such issues cannot be discussed because it was not in the Board pack.” State Capture Inquiry:
