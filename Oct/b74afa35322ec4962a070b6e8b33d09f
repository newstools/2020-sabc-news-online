A former police commissioner in KwaZulu-Natal and a police captain who are allegedly connected to a 2010 tender fraud are expected to hand themselves over at the Durban Central Police Station on Monday morning. The two are the remaining suspects in the corruption case involving controversial Durban businessman Thoshan Panday and Police Colonel Navin Madhoe who were arrested and appeared in court on Friday. All four accused are linked to a R47 million fraudulent police accommodation tender awarded during the 2010 World Cup. Panday and Madhoe were granted bail of R100 000 and R10 000 respectively.
