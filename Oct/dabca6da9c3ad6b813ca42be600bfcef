The trial of former North West deputy police Commissioner William Mpembe and his five co-accused is continuing in the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Tuesday morning. Mpembe is facing charges of murder in connection with the death of two mineworkers and two police officers in Marikana in August 2012. The state is arguing that Mpembe who was the overall commander of the police on the day gave instruction that tear gas and stun grenades be used to disperse a group of striking mineworkers. This they say led to the death of the four men. His co-accused are facing a charge of murder for allegedly killing a mine worker who took an R5 rifle from a police official. The state will continue with the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Jacobus Botha from the policeâ€™s local criminal record centre. The state provided a list of more than a 100 witnesses in this trial that started on Monday. The incident has been described as the deadliest use of force by the police in South Africa, since the 1976 Soweto June 16 uprisings.
