Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, says they are opposed to the looming retrenchments at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). He told a media briefing in Johannesburg earlier this afternoon that the public broadcaster needs to be seen to be protecting its workers. The SABC has issued suspension letters to more than 10 employees believed to have been appointed irregularly and more retrenchments are on the cards if things go according to plan. Malema says the public broadcaster should not be used to settle political factional battles. “We don’t want that, We oppose that and we are with the workers. They must find the money and finance that SABC to work properly and it must work objectively, particularly SABC News and not create an ENCA light as we see now.” Cross-examination of Gordhan Malema says the cross-examination of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan by former SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane is long overdue. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo ruled that Moyane may cross-examine Gordhan, subject to certain conditions. His questions must pertain, for example, to Gordhan’s allegation that the laying of criminal charges against him was motivated by Moyane’s malicious pursuit of state capture objectives. Malema says it is not fair that former President Jacob Zuma is treated differently from Gordhan. “You’ve never called a press conference to address us about Pravin when Pravin said on the morning, ‘Sorry I’m going to work today.’ Cabinet is where Pravin works, Zondo didn’t have harsh words for Pravin, and because Pravin is a darling he controls the investigations and the leading person there.” Malema briefs the media:
