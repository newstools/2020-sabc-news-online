Accusations of bribes and sex in exchange for jobs have marred the completion of a multimillion rand Lerato Park Housing project in Kimberley. Workers recently protested at the site accusing the local councillor and the community liaison officer of soliciting sexual favours and bribes for jobs such as painting and installing paving. They have also accused the councillor of facilitating the removal of workers from the project when they voiced concerns about underpayment and side lining of others. The local Human Settlements department has confirmed that a complaint of sexual harassment has been laid but the local councilor refuted the claims. Workers have called on Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul to intervene and have shared some of their experiences. “The premier must come and repeat what he said that every project that comes here must employ locals because we are bullied by the councillor.” “They told me that it is Friday and I should give them something to buy a cooldrink if I want to work. I refused to do that. I should not have to pay to work.” “What about the people who live here? where is our work and where are the jobs that we are supposed to benefit from so that we can feed our families?”
