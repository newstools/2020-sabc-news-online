Nurses’ union, DENOSA, wants Gauteng Premier David Makhura to take special leave. DENOSA Gauteng Chairperson Simphiwe Gada says the union will work with Makhura once the Special Investigating Unit’s investigation into PPE procurement in the province is complete and his name is cleared. The union says the Premier has a tendency of escaping accountability amid scandals rocking his administration. It cited the Life Esidimeni tragedy as one such instances, saying “we think that he must go and rest for six week – or for the duration that the SIU investigation is happening.” The union’s Gauteng branch held a special Provincial Executive Committee meeting this weekend. Briefing the media on Sunday, Gada expressed disappointment over the sacking of the provincial health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku. DENOSA has thrown its weight behind Masuku, saying he did a good job until the COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment scandal broke. The union, however, criticised Makhura for saying he will reinstate him should the ongoing SIU find him not to have colluded in any corrupt activity. “We need decisive leadership. The Premier must make a decision and fire or hire.” DENOSA has also raised concern over instability in the health department sparked by recent resignations of the head of department, the chief financial officer and the sacking of Masuku. “You know when there is no PPE; you know who is going to be blamed is the nurse,” he says.
