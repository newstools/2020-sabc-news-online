The office of the Minister of Communications – Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams – has confirmed to SABC News that one of the board members of the Post Office, Colleen Makhubele, has been shown the door. It says a resolution of the Special General Meeting by the shareholder was taken to fire Makhubele. Ministry spokesperson, Mish Molakeng, says there was agreement among other individual board members that Makhubele’s behaviour warranted her departure. Molakeng says details of the resolution are confidential for now and the minister is expected to inform the public about the matter soon. Ndabeni-Abrahams denies intefering in SAPO tender Earlier in October, Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams denied she interfered in a lucrative R2.1 billion e-commerce platform tender at the South African Post Office (SAPO). She says the allegations that she flouted procurement processes are malicious, untrue and irresponsible. She brought along the Acting Chairperson of SAPO, Tia van der Sand, and the Acting Director-General of her department, Nomvuyiso Batyi, to also address the media on the issue. They both denied that Ndabeni-Abrahams acted improperly. Ndabeni-Abrahams says chasing headlines with unsubstantiated facts will not remove the rot of corruption in society. “I don’t know why they are attacking me. It bothers me that they are misleading people. It bothers me that they are breaking the ethics of journalism. But it doesn’t bother me as a person because as I said at the end of the day I’m not here to be liked by anyone. In the work that I do, there are those who like me and those who dislike me, and I welcome them all because it’s my responsibility to serve both.”
