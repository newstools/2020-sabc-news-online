The High Court in Johannesburg will on Friday morning hand down judgment in the bail appeal of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. Agrizzi has been in jail since October 14 after the Specialised Commercial Crime Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court refused to grant him bail. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi denied bail:  He is facing a corruption charge which relates to the payments made to former ANC MP Vincent Smith who is also on bail for fraud and corruption. Although Agrizzi is in jail, he is at a private hospital under police guard after having a heart attack. Police have argued that his release on bail could result in him possibly evading the trial. State Advocate Arno Rossouw insists Agrizzi misled the court about his off-shore assets at his earlier bail application. But his his lawyer Mannie Wirtz says denying him bail is detrimental to his health. Justice Mokgoatlheng will deliver his judgment at 10am this morning.
