The African National Congress (ANC) branch chairperson from Ward 4 at Camperdown in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands says he is still living in fear as his attackers are still at large. Sbu Mchunu has been in hiding since a shooting attack at his home in March this year. Mchunu says he can’t even go back to work as he continues to receive death threats despite police investigating his attempted murder case. On the 5th of March, Mchunu was attacked by gunmen while closing his gate, but managed to escape unharmed. Months later, the ANC branch leader says his life remains in danger and he can’t even return to work. Mchunu says he had begun receiving death threats months before the shooting. He says although he opened a case with the police, nothing has been done. Police say the matter is still under investigation. Police Spokesperson Jay Naicker says there have been several incidents in the past where ANC leaders were attacked and also killed in the area. In 2017, Ward Councillor Kwazi Mkhize was gunned down after a community meeting. Naicker says police are doing everything to arrest the suspects. “A case of attempted murder was opened. The suspect in this matter is not known. The branch commander and the investigating officer have been in constant contact with the victim. They are not aware of any threats made towards the victim.”
