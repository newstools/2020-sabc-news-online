The state is opposing Agrizzi’s bail application in his corruption case. Joooo Agrizzi such a lot of money offshore  and doesn’t disclose. The Banks must be held accountable. — Sophie Mokoena (@Sophie_Mokoena) October 14, 2020  Agrizzi is a co-accused in the R800 000 fraud and corruption case against former ANC MP, Vincent Smith. Smith is accused of accepting so-called “gratifications” from Bosasa to act in its interest in Parliament.

Measures have been put in place to recoup the funds.
