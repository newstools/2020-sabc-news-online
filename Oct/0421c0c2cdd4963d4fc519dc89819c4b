A project to install WIFI to Buffalo City residents in the Eastern Cape hangs in the balance. The R18 million project was launched in 2017 to install 88 WIFI hotspots across the metro, but to date only a handful are operational. Questions are being raised on whether funds spent on the project were used wisely. About 52 hotspot points were installed, but later removed as they were not operational. This project was aimed at assisting students and job seekers in the metro. “It’s difficult for us to do our personal stuff. There’s no WIFI available around BCM. That’s all l can say. It’s a challenge to us. We so wish that something can be done,” says job seeker, Aphiwe Shai. “It saves us money as I am a student. I would have been able to apply for NSFAS and access online study material,” says student Inganathi Nqayi. Buffalo City Metro has cited financial challenges for the delay. “The project did very well until we picked up some issues that there were high maintenance costs as well as licensing and on top of that, we also experienced issues of vandalism that led us to take decisions to suspend it,” says Metro Spokesperson, Samkelo Ngwenya. The metro has committed to engage stakeholders to ensure this project is up and running soon. WiFi project in the Eastern Cape hangs in the balance:
