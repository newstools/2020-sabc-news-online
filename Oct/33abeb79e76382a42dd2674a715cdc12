The High Court in Cape Town has ordered a group of seven queer activists occupying a rental property in Camps Bay to vacate the property by October 8. This comes after an urgent application for the eviction order was heard in court on Friday. Some in the group argued that they will become homeless if they are evicted from the property. The City of Cape Town says that alternative shelter will be available next Thursday in Philippi if the group meets minimum requirements. Group representative Sarah Summers says the judge favoured them. “I think the Judge gave us the best judgment he could, and it opened a lot of options for us to seek, ja, like the human rights that we want to see happen. I don’t know what all the implications are in the paper yet, but I really feel like we got a fair trial.” High Court orders queer activists group to vacate a property they are occupying in Cape Town
