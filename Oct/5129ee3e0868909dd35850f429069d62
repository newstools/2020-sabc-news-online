Passengers travelling to Hong Kong and Italy from Britainâ€™s Heathrow Airport will undergo a one-hour coronavirus test before flying out of the United Kingdom under plans to open up international travel, The Times reported on Tuesday. Rapid tests will be introduced from Tuesday at Heathrow Airport to allow travellers to enter countries where a negative COVID-19 test result is needed to skip quarantine, the newspaper said. Passengers require to book a test in advance at a cost of 80 pounds ($103), The Times said. Heathrow Airport did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters.
