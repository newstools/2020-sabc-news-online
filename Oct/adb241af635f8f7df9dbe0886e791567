Zimbabwe has commended Tanzania for conducting successful elections that saw John Magufuli win a second term as that country’s President. Magufuli won the elections by more than 12.5 million votes. In his bid for a second term, he has promised voters that he will boost the economy by completing ambitious infrastructure projects he started in his first term. These include a new hydropower dam, a rail-line and planes for the national carrier. The government projects economic growth of 5.5% in 2020 after COVID-19 hit key sectors such as tourism. The World Bank predicts expansion of only 2.5%. Magufuli is promising voters that his infrastructure projects will fuel growth of at least 8%:  Zimbabwe’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Sibusiso Moyo, has described the Tanzania polls, as proof of Africa’s maturity to run free and fair elections. “We think the process so far of the elections has gone well and we would like to congratulate the people of Tanzania for having cast their votes under these very difficult circumstances of COVID-19. We believe that the African continent is now mature to actually run efficient and clear elections which are free and fair and which actually provide the right of its people to choose its leadership and to actually determine its own self determination.” Magufuli has been re-elected for a second five-year term:  However, the United Kingdom, has expressed concern following allegations of irregularities in the elections. This despite the Tanzanian electoral commission’s announcement that the polls were free and fair.
