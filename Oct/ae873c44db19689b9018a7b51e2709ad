Farmers in the drought-stricken Central Karoo region of the Western Cape are appealing for help amid a continuing drought. They say the recent good winter rains in the province have not done much to end a seven-year drought in their area. The situation looks slightly better in Beaufort West, one of the biggest towns in the region. Two years ago, the main Gamka Dam dried up completely but now it stands at 26% capacity. Provincial authorities say they remain concerned about farmers and are trying to assist wherever they can. Farmer, Salie Jacobs says more needs to be done. “We definitely need some funding, some assistance to buy and feed for our stock. That’s our main need at the moment. At the moment, we are using our reserve funds from our savings accounts just to survive at this point in time.” The Central Karoo region still faces drought: Agri-Central Karoo manager, Dean Gouws says the situation is dire the area. “The average rainfall for the Central Karoo here is standing at about 16 millimetres and if you take dam levels in our area is about 15. 95%, which is a sign that there was no rainfall comparing the western coast areas here in the Central Karoo, so people are still battling. They are still feeding their animals..”
