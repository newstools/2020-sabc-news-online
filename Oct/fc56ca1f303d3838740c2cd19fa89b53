Technicalities are once again delaying proceedings in the bail application of Pastor Timothy Omotoso in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Omotoso is applying for bail for the third time while waiting for his trial to resume following postponements due to the lockdown. The bone of contention between his lawyer Advocate Terry Price SC and Judge Phillip Zilwa is whether a new court should hear the bail application or his trial court. Proceedings have been adjourned until 14:00. Zilwa says will deal with bail application but asks Price to supply judge and state with heads of arguments and other documents to look at before continuing with matter.Court is adjourned until 2pm,to give State and Judge Zilwa to go through heads of argument. #sabcnews — Lerato Fekisi (@LThipa) October 6, 2020  Price wants an inquest about the protracted delays in the trial and the testimony of two witnesses who testified against Omotoso dismissed. Omotoso and his co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho are facing a range of charges including rape, sexual assault and human trafficking. Sulani and Sitho are out on bail while Omotoso has been in custody for three years.  Meanwhile, members of the African National Congress Women’s League were outside the court saying that Omotoso should not be granted bail: ANCWL outside court in support that Tim Omotoso should not be granted bail. #Omotosotrial pic.twitter.com/1ACbhLKsAK — BULELANI (@BulelaniCiki) October 6, 2020
