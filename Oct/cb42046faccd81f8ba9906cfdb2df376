Renewable power-generation company, Lekela, which is responsible for building the Perdekraal East Wind Farm in the Karoo, says all their projects support local communities. The 48 turbine wind farm, situated near Matjiesfontein, is their fourth wind farm in South Africa. It commenced commercial operation on Thursday and will now be contributing 110 megawatts to the national grid. The local community has a shareholding though a community trust. Chief Executive at Lekela Chris Antonopoulos says every renewable project will benefit South Africa. “Every renewable project which reached completion means South Africa gains more advantage from its abandoned energy resources more vital power flows into the national grid with all the relevant benefits for the country and its citizens.” Great news! The Perdekraal East Wind Farm in the Western Cape has officially commenced its 20-year Commercial Operations period, now contributing 110MW of new wind power capacity to the national grid.
