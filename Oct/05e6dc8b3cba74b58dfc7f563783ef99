The first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the country on March 31.  Currently, there are 2 269 cases, 1 706 have recovered and 72 have died.

In Sierra Leone, we have 12 antigens in the routine immunisation system. Providing this service regularly to every eligible child means we are able to prevent illnesses that would have otherwise occurred if those children were not protected.” Below is the full statement:
