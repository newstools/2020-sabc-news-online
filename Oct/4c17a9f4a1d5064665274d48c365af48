The African National Congress (ANC) MP Cedric Frolick has denied receiving any money from Bosasa as the company’s former COO Angelo Agrizzi had alleged. Agrizzi told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg that Frolick received R 40 000 a month, to persuade Parliament’s former Correctional Services Portfolio Committee Chair Vincent Smith to co-operate with Bosasa. Frolick says the owners of Bosasa, the Watson brothers were his friends as an ANC activist and was involved in rugby development in the Eastern Cape with Daniel “Cheeky” Watson. “Chairperson I would like to state that I did not receive any money from Bosasa, Mr Watson or Valence Watson, let alone monthly payments as alleged by Mr Agrizzi in his supplementary affidavit during 2014 before the general election. I received amounts totalling about R 25 000  from Mr Valence Watson as a contribution towards the ANC election funds at the time I served on the finance and fundraising committee in the region and I am still a member and these monies were handed over to the regional secretary of the ANC and it was also confirmed by the regional treasurer.” State Capture Inquiry live stream below: Last month, former Parliamentary Portfolio Committee Chairperson on Correctional Services, Vincent Smith testified at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry.
