Fort Hare University in the Eastern Cape has reported close to 30 coronavirus cases among students since the announcement of Alert Level 1 of the lockdown. According to the provincial Health Department, the cases stem from two parties that some students attended earlier this month. Those affected are mainly from the university’s faculties of nursing sciences as well as law. The positive students are currently in isolation at the Alice campus. The Health Department’s spokesperson Siyanda Manana says, “The source of this, according to our investigation, stems from a party which was held on the 3rd of October and also followed by another one on the 10th of October in Quigney in East London. Two of the students left for home after testing positive, one went to mount Fletcher, one went to Reston, the others were sent to isolation and quarantine at the University of Fort Hare Alice campus.”
