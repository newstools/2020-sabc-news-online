Police Minister Bheki Cele has shutdown Blackdoor Lifestyle Lounge in Sandton, Johannesburg, for breaking the lockdown regulations. The establishment was operating even after the midnight curfew and was allegedly packed beyond capacity. It is also alleged that the management failed to present a liquor license when requested by authorities to do so. The operation was part of the police’s Operation O Kae Molao. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela were also part of the raid. “Our information was correct, we came here, they call this place Blackdoor, there were almost 300 people, packed, no masks at all, no social distancing, breaking the law and it tell you that the second wave will not really survive. But besides breaking the COVID law, people are breaking the real law to be here after curfew, they are still packed here,” says Cele.

The owner of the club will be charged with contravention of the Disaster Management Act. pic.twitter.com/WQafjYOYCI — Lirandzu Themba (@LirandzuThemba) October 24, 2020  Alert Level 1 of the lockdown has seen most sectors of the economy reopening – but experts say many people are falling into a false sense of security about the virus.
