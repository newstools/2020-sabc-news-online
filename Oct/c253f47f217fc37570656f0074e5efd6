Polls opened in Guinea on Sunday with incumbent President Alpha Conde hoping to extend his decade in power. That third term has been made possible by a new constitution that prompted months of protests in which, according to Amnesty International, at least 50-people have died. Violence has also erupted during campaigning in recent weeks but at a polling station in the capital Conakry, voter, Ames Paye, said that what unites Guineans is stronger than what divides them and he hopes they will give their votes, not their lives. However, the United Nations has warned of divisive appeals to ethnic affiliations on the campaign trail. Conde and his main rival Cellou Diallo both draw much of their support from their respective ethnic communities. Diallo, a former prime minister who was runner up to Conde in 2010 and 2015, has warned of fraud in the election and says he will challenge any irregularities. Many political analysts expect Conde to prevail after he won overwhelming approval for the constitutional change â€“ though that vote was boycotted by the opposition. Conde says the reform was constitutional and democratic and argues that he needs another term to finish major mining and infrastructure projects. Under his stewardship, Guinea has made progress in developing its mineral riches, including bauxite and iron are, and GDP has doubled over the past 10-years.
