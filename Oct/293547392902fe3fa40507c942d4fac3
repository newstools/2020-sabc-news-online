Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security in the City of Cape Town, JP Smith, has congratulated traffic officers for arresting a man found in the possession of 12 firearms in the Table View area. The serial numbers of the firearms had been filed off. The 37-year-old man was arrested following a high-speed car chase along Potsdam Road this morning. He ended up at the Dunoon Taxi Rank. Officers had stopped him at a roadblock in nearby Killarney and he sped away. Smith says he is proud of the traffic officers manning the roadblock. “This is excellent work by our staff members and I commend them for not giving up on the chase. It was an important recovery because it means a dozen fewer illegal firearms are off our streets. That said, the details of this case are extremely concerning. There are many unanswered questions, like where the suspect got the guns, and its intended use. I urge the South African Police Service to prioritise the investigation so that the truth may come out. It’s unlikely the suspect acted alone, and if there are more players involved in this, they need to be brought to book.”
