The Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga will on Friday resume the bail hearing of a member of the African National Congress Provincial Executive Committee and his stepson who are accused of raping two eight-year-old girls. The two are facing charges of rape and sexual assault. One of the girls reported the matter to her school teacher in July. The two were arrested on Monday after months of investigation. In the video below, chaos erupted outside the court when they made their first appearance:  SABC Reporter Tumelo Machogo gives background: Last year, two of the ANC’s top spokespeople voluntarily stepped aside from their positions in the wake of sex claims. Zizi Kodwa faced rape allegations and Pule Mabe faced sexual harassment accusations by his former PA. Mabe has since been cleared by his party following an internal probe and the woman who accused Kodwa of rape withdrew the complaint.
