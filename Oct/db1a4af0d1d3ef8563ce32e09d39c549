The Hawks in Limpopo say there is the possibility of further arrests being made after four people were arrested at the weekend in connection with the theft of R4.8 million belonging to Makgatho Community Property Association. The suspects, aged between 51 and 70, will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke says they allegedly plotted to irregularly award a farming tender to a company linked to the wife of a senior municipal official. “So far, we have arrested four suspects. We cannot rule out the possibility of arresting more suspects because we thought we were only arresting three but we arrested four, so we cannot rule out that possibility. As the investigations are on-going anything is possible,” says Maluleke. Last week, a countrywide Hawks swoop saw the arrest of some senior African National Congress (ANC) members in the Free State, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Some of the arrests were as a result of the evidence given at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg.
