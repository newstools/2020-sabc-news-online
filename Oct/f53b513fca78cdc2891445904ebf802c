President Cyril Ramaphosa has begun a period of self-quarantine following the positive COVID-19 diagnosis of a guest at a dinner he attended. The Presidency says last Saturday Ramaphosa attended a fundraising dinner of the Adopt-a-School Foundation, which is a partner entity of the Cyril Ramaphosa Foundation. The event for 35 guests was held at a Johannesburg hotel where the foundation guests were the only people hosted by the establishment. Acting Presidential spokesperson Tyrone Seale says the President is showing no symptoms at this time and will perform his duties remotely as well as observing the guidelines that apply to self-quarantine. The Adopt-a-School Foundation advised dinner guests on Tuesday that a guest had shown symptoms on Sunday and had been tested on Monday before receiving a positive result on Tuesday. The President has wished the guest, who is receiving medical attention, a safe and speedy recovery, and wishes other guests good health. The event adhered stringently to COVID-19 protocols and directives on screening, social distancing and the wearing of masks. As was the case with all guests, the President himself removed his mask only when dining and addressing the guests. The Foundation became aware of this development and communicated this to guests yesterday, hours after the President had performed the unveiling of a statue of liberation icon OR Tambo and the official opening of a new Radisson hotel and convention centre in Ekurhuleni in the morning. The President is screened regularly by the South African Military Health Service and subjects himself to screening at venues where he participates in engagements. The President is showing no symptoms at this time and will, in line with COVID-19 health advice, be tested should symptoms manifest. President Ramaphosa is self-quarantine:
