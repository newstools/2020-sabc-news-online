Residents are urged to exercise extreme caution while driving, and avoid low-lying areas at risk of flooding. On Monday, the M1 double-decker bridge was closed to traffic as a result of flooding, while parts of the N1 at the Maraisburg offramp and Klipspruit Valley Road in Soweto were also affected. The Johannesburg Road Agency says maintenance teams have been dispatched to known problem areas to assist with any problems that might occur. At least two people died during Monday’s storm – a man was struck by lighting on a farm in Elandsfontein, while a woman was struck and killed in Melville.
