Deputy Cooperative Governance Minister Parks Tau says he stands by the Gauteng government’s decision to dissolve the Tshwane Council. He says the decision was based on the state of the city. Earlier, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein confirmed the decision of the High Court in Pretoria that the provincial government’s dissolution of the Tshwane Council was unlawful. Tau says key to the decision was the fact that there was already a collapse in governance with the council failing to sit for prolonged periods which threatened the passing of the budget. “Was it important for government to make an intervention as done by the provisional government of Gauteng? In a metropolitan municipality where governance at collapsed? In the capital city of the Republic. Certainly, it was. At least to the extent that the Minister applies their mind to the issue at hand and making decisions on the issues at hand the Minister applied her mind and was objective in applying her mind,” says Tau.
