Former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has reportedly vowed not to make an appearance at the African National Congress’ (ANC) Integrity Commission without her lawyers present. The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal is, however, insisting that lawyers have no place in internal party matters. Gumede was arrested in May last year in connection with corruption relating to a multi-million waste removal tender. She is accused of plotting with some companies and municipal officials to manipulate the tender. She is out on R50 000 bail. “The terms of references of the Commission spells out that a member is permitted to appear before it accompanied by another member of the ANC. I don’t think it describes someone’s profession in their own life, but she must be accompanied by another member of the ANC who she would depend on to help answer questions,” says Mdumiseni Ntuli, ANC KZN Provincial Secretary. Last month, Gumede appeared at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court. Gumede’s lawyers filed an application for the case against her to be struck off the roll. They argued that the NPA has failed to provide her with the relevant charges since her arrest last year. Despite the continuing court matter, Gumede was still sworn in as ANC member of the provincial legislature. Her deployment sparked an outcry. This prompted the ANC to take a decision that she will not participate in legislature activities until she has been cleared by the party’s Integrity Commission.
