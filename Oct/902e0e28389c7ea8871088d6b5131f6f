The remaining accused who is a KwaZulu-Natal former Police Commissioner is set to also present herself shortly. The two were asked to hand themselves over on Monday by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).  They are the remaining suspects in the corruption case of Panday and Police Colonel Navin Madhoe who were arrested and appeared in court on Friday.
