Madikizela says unity in the party is his focus. ” We need to make sure the party is united. We are coming from a very challenging time as the party. We don’t have to like each other as members, but we must understand what brings us together, which is our common vision. Secondly, we need to have a stable party if we want to attract people. Stability is very important, not only to attract people from the outside but it will enable us to function better so that we can grow. ”
