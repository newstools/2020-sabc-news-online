The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development has engaged with land claimants of Madalaskom and the Matsafeni-Mdluli community in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, to resolve their land dispute. The Madalaskom land claim has dragged on for years, unresolved. However, seemingly, a resolution may be on the horizon. “There’s a tug-of-war between tenants and claimants over a piece of land in Mbombela. The Land Claims Commission is unable to finalise the claim because tenants were included in the claim. The community was removed from the land known as Madalaskom, in White River, in 1968. The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development has engaged with the communities of White River and Matsafeni in a bid to quell the tension. The claimants blame the Land Claims Commission for the delays.” The claimants were removed from Madalaskom in 1968. The Matsafeni piece of land, which the Mbombela stadium has been built on, was given to the Mdluli family and the community of Matsafeni. Later, the Nkosi family claimed the same piece of land. Matsafeni-Mdluli Trust’s Mish Silinda says a solution has been found. “As part of the settlement, what government did, they have identified land outside … the land by the trust which is going be given to the Nkosi family. Part of the land, which is owned by the Matsafeni Trust, is going be given to the community. They already have their own trust … their development trust called Matsafeni Development Trust, which will hold the land which will be transferred from the trust to the development trust, to the community.” Minister for Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza says their engagements with the claimants and tenants is aimed at finding an amicable solution, which will make all parties involved happy. The department has, in the meantime, identified a piece of land for the Nkosi family in the Barberton area. The family was unavailable for comment.
