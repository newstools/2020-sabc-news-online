Gauteng Premier David Makhura axed Masuku on Friday after a preliminary report by the SIU said he had not exercised due diligence regarding the procurement of PPEs by the province’s health department. “The SIU has found that the Health MEC, Bandile Masuku, has failed to execute his function in compliance with the constitution and public finance management act. Based on the finding where they say that the MEC has failed to execute his functions in compliance with the constitution and the PFMA, I have decided to discharge Dr Bandile Masuku from his responsibilities as the Gauteng MEC for Health,” Makhura said.
