A Free State family has been left horrified, confused and overwhelmed after a mother poisoned herself and her five children in Phamong village in Qwaqwa. The woman and two children were declared dead on the scene. The other two children died in the hospital. Only a six-month-old infant survived the tragedy. Free State police spokesperson Motantsi Makhele says it is believed that the woman had an argument with her husband. A police investigation has revealed that the incident happened after a dispute between the woman and her husband. “On Saturday the 17 October 2020 at about 15:20 the mother found her 29 years old daughter and her five children lying on the floor. An ambulance was called and the mother and two kids aged 9 and 6 were declared dead at the scene.  A case of inquest and a murder case has been registered for further investigation.” A psychologist, Dr Sam Chwenemang, believes the woman could have been overwhelmed by her social challenges. “Quite often people have a very intense feeling or sense of helplessness or hopelessness. They really think death and suicide is the only option that is left for them, under those circumstances. It’s unfortunate that outside having contacted as assessment one cannot directly attribute this to something specific.” In 2018, a Soweto woman poisoned herself and her three children.
