Victims of Gender-Based- Violence who died in the past month in Polokwane in Limpopo and other parts have been remembered during a balloon send-off ceremony. The organisation against GBV, Women Taking Back Safety, gathered in Boom street in the CBD to speak out against the killing of women. Polokwane has recorded a number of violent murders of women recently, including businesswomen, Makoena Mabusela- Leshabane, Tebogo Mphuti, Lizette and Heatie Deacon. Convenor of the organisation, Mabotse Mothiba, says far too many women have died. “As we remember the lives of Makoena, Phuti, Joyce, and many other women that lost their lives at the hands of men. It has been a crazy month in Polokwane. It has been very sad. We have lost women of substance, we have lost women who were going to make sure that our economy grows. We have lost business-minded women at the hands of men. What have we done to you to deserve to die like this?”
