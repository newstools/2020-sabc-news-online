The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) leadership in the Eastern Cape has criticised what they call the undermining of collective bargaining by government. This as the labour union led a peaceful march in Mthatha’s CBD to highlight issues that include the ongoing dispute between government and its employees, labour brokers as well as corruption amongst others. The African National Congress (ANC) leadership in the province led by its Secretary General, Lulama Ngcukayitobi, and Education MEC, Fundile Gade were part of the march. Cosatu Provincial Chairperson, Thabile Kunene, says its is disgusting that public servants have not received their monies to date due to government’s failure to take its employees seriously.   “The significance of this march today is to bring back the strength of Cosatu in the province; it is to unite the alliance and the people of Eastern Cape in one cause of fighting corruption; of fighting parasitism; of fighting maladmistration; of fighting all the ills that affect our people. The grievances are taken to government mainly because those who are leading in government have been involved in ills of corruption and because those who are leading in government have undermined collective bargaining. Up to today, workers in the public service have not received their monies.” What transpired during the marches in the Eastern Cape:  Calls for quick economy recovery: Meanwhile, Cosatu General-Secretary, Bheki Ntshatshali, says they would like to see sectors of the economy recovering soon. He joined scores of members of unions in Polokwane, Limpopo.
