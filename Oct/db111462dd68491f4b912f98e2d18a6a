KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC, Bheki Ntuli, has urged motorists to be vigilant on the roads as the province experiences another spike in road crashes. This after at least 29 people have been killed in major crashes in recent days. In one incident, 16 people were killed in a crash on the R34 between Melmoth and Ulundi. Ntuli was addressing a provincial taxi lekgotla in Durban. “We believe that if road users can actually be vigilant when driving on our roads especially now as it going to rain.  They must make sure their tyres are right and they must make sure they keep to the speed limit relevant to that particular area because we are very worried as a government that a lot of people are dying on our roads.” Ntuli is leading a provincial taxi lekgotla to discuss the future of the industry. Input is also expected from the metered taxi sector, e-hailing services, and municipality transportation. Ntuli says the discussions will also focus on leadership, industry regulation, and road safety. “The Lekgotla today is going to culminate to the national Lekgotla and it is as a result of the minister have felt that we should firstly regularize the industry and we should also assist them in terms of professionalism in the industry so that they are able to serve their customers in a way that customers would enjoy and appreciate using their vehicles.”
