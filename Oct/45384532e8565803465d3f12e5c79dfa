A 39-year-old South African Revenue Service (SARS) official is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for alleged corruption and extortion. The Hawks arrested the SARS employee on Monday after allegedly meeting with the company director and agreeing on a R10 000 payment to manipulate the tax assessment. This after a company director was issued with a subpoena for outstanding tax returns and payments in February 2019. The meeting happened while the company’s auditor had already liaised with the SARS official and all the necessary documents required were handed in. Hawks spokesperson Lynda Steyn says, “It is alleged the business owner received several phone calls from the accused, requesting to meet him personally. The complainant met with the suspect, where he alleged that he could help the complainant resolve the outstanding tax assessments to disappear in return of a R20 000 gratification.” “The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on Monday granted a directive and the complainant met with the suspect at the company offices, where an amount of R10 000 was agreed upon. He was arrested at the spot for alleged corruption and extortion. His Mercedes Benz sedan was also seized during the operation,” adds Steyn.
