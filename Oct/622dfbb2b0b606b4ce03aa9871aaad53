Police have appealed to members of the public who have information about the gunning down of the manager of the Sedibeng Municipality in the south of Johannesburg to come forward. Stanley Khanyile was shot six times in Alberton in a suspected assassination on Saturday. The incident happened while he was sitting in his car in the parking lot of a shopping centre. Police say the gunman jumped into a gold-coloured Toyota Cressida after the shooting and sped off. Khanyile was the former head of the Eastern Cape Social Development Department. He was due to appear in court on October 16 on charges of money laundering, fraud and theft relating to a multi-million-rand project in the province. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says the motive of the shooting is still unclear. “The motive for the shooting is unclear at this stage. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspect or suspects is urged to contact the nearest police station or to contact the saps crime stop number 08600 10111.
