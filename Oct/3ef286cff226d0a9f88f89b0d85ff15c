Renewable power-generation company, Lekela, which is responsible for building the Perdekraal East Wind Farm in the Little Karoo, says all their projects support local communities. The 48 turbine wind farm, situated near Matjiesfontein, is their fourth wind farm in South Africa. It commenced commercial operation on Thursday and will now be contributing 110 megawatts to the national grid. Perdekraal East Wind Farm is a great example of private sector investing in #renewableenergy & so we continue to call on @GwedeMantashe1 to maintain urgency to bring REIPPP bid window 5 projects onto the grid & provide clarity on procurement by municipalities. #greeneconomy pic.twitter.com/aJIX5MWkUK — David Maynier (@DavidMaynier) October 9, 2020  The local community has shareholding although it is a community trust.   “Every renewable project which reached completion means South Africa gains more advantage from its abandoned energy resources. More vital power flows into the national grid with all the relevant benefits for the country and its citizens,” says Lekela Chief Executive Chris Antonopoulos.
