A 50-year-old pilot has died after his light aircraft crashed and caught fire at a farm in Kirkwood, near Uitenhage, in the Eastern Cape. Police spokesperson Majola Nkohli has identified the pilot as Andries Duffy. It is alleged that he was busy cropping orchards when his two-seater aircraft crashed and burst into flames. He burnt beyond recognition. Majola says an inquest docket has been opened. This is a second light aircraft crash in the country in recent weeks. A week ago, a light aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from an airstrip in Hilton in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, killing two people. It is believed that the plane was destined for the Umkomaas Airfield on the provinceâ€™s south coast. Spokesperson for the South African Civil Aviation Authority, Kabelo Ledwaba, says a team of investigators have begun collecting evidence on site. He says a preliminary report into the incident will be issued in 30 days. More on the incident in the video below:
