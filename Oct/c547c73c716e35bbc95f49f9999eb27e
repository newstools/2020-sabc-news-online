The African National Congress Gauteng’s Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) has resolved that former Health MEC Bandile Masuku and Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko should be taken to the party’s Disciplinary Committee. The PEC held a two-day Special meeting virtually on Tuesday and Wednesday, to determine what action to be taken on the matters related to alleged corruption in the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment in the Gauteng Health Department. In a statement, the PEC says the outcome of the Disciplinary Committee will determine if both Masuku and Diko should remain PEC members or be removed. The PEC also agreed that Masuku and Diko be barred from attending organizational work until finalization of the DC process. It also endorsed the premier’s decision to remove Masuku from his MEC position. The PEC however resolved that Masuku’s wife, Loyiso should return to her position as MMC in City of Joburg and Deputy Regional Secretary of the party’s Johannesburg region. On the VBS matters, the PEC agreed to suspend its decision that implicated members should resign from their deployment positions, pending the outcome of the NEC appeal process.
