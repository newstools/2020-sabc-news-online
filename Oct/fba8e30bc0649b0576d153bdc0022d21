Correctional Services says it will closely monitor the condition of former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, who has been transferred from prison in Johannesburg to an external public hospital for medical attention. Agrizzi spent his first night in prison on Wednesday after he was denied bail in the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. He appeared on charges of corruption and fraud. Angelo Agrizzi’s bail application:  During his bail application, Agrizzi’s lawyer argued that sending him to prison would be detrimental to his health as he had comorbidities and the system was still struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, state advocate Arno Rossouw told the court that Agrizzi was a huge flight risk because of his substantial foreign investments in countries like Italy that run into millions of rand. Agrizzi will be back in court with his co-accused, former African National Congress MP Vincent Smith who’s out on R30 000 bail, on the 3rd of December. Department of Correctional Services, Singabakho Nxumalo, says Agrizzi’s medical condition will be monitored. “The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) can confirm that Remand Detainee, Angelo Agrizzi, has been transferred to an external public hospital in order to receive further medical attention. All inmates are entitled to healthcare services in line with correctional provisions. His condition will continue to be monitored.” The case of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi and former ANC MP, Vincent Smith, will be back in the Commercial Crimes court in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on December 3rd.
