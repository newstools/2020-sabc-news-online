The case of fraud and corruption against former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vincent Smith has been postponed to December 3 by the Commercial Crimes court sitting in Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning. It was his second appearance at the court. He was released on R30 000 bail over a week ago. Below is the bail hearing:  Documentation Magistrate Phillip Venter told Smith that because the state had their offices closed, it was not easy to access relevant documentation for this case on Wednesday. He ordered Smith not to bend the bail conditions. Meanwhile, former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is currently filing his bail application at the same court. He appears after he failed to appear with Vincent Smith due to ill-health.
