The second suspect in the theft of R25 million from accounts of Limpopo government departments has been granted R2000 bail by the Waterval Magistrate’s Court near Elim outside Louis Trichardt. Walter Mashau allegedly worked together with a bank employee, Fhatuwani Mudzanani, to steal the money. The case against the two has been postponed to the 20th. Mudzanani was released earlier on R10 000 bail. The two are accused of transferring money from government accounts to accounts they created. Spokesperson for the National Prosecution Authority in Limpopo, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, says the case has been postponed to give Mudzanani time to appoint a new lawyer. “Second accused Walter Mashau on the Absa R25 million fraud case was granted bail of R2 000 today by the Waterval Magistrate’s Court, the matter was postponed to 20th October 2020.” Four bank cards and R2 000 in cash were seized from his house during his arrest.
