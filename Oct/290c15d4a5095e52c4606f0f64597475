Twelve people, including a child, have been killed in a minibus taxi crash between Underberg and Bulwer near the southern Drakensberg in KwaZulu-Natal. Three occupants of the minibus sustained serious injuries and were treated by paramedics on the scene on Saturday afternoon. Unconfirmed reports say that the victims were from the same family. Robert Mckensie from the Emergency Medical Services KZN says the minibus taxi went off the road and crashed down an embankment. “There’s been a single-vehicle crash involving a minibus which has left the road and crashed down an embankment coming to rest near a river. Tragically, 12 people have sustained fatal injuries in this crash, including a child. Paramedics from several private emergency services as well as KZN emergency services were present. I’m currently at the scene; three patients are in a serious condition and are being treated at the scene before being transported to hospital.”
