Mpumalanga Arts and Culture MEC Lindiwe Ntshalintshali believes that the province’s staging of the South African Traditional Music Awards (SATMAs) will bring the much-needed economic relief to the ailing economy. She was speaking in Mbombela during the launch of the SATMAs which the province will host in the next three years. Ntshalintshali has urged people to take advantage of the opportunities that the awards will present. “Your Makhonjwa Mountains, your big five that are here in the province, your three rondavels, the Gods window, the skywalk, so our province is beautifully so as we host it in the next three years. We are saying there will be opportunities and what’s good they come with a foundation that will be giving back to the community of Mpumalanga. We are not taking it light, we’re saying those with facility must make sure that there is a lot of accommodation.” This year SATMA's will be Honouring Legends or Icon under the theme: Celebrating Afrika and Celebrating 15 Years.
