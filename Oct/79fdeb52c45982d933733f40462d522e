The Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) says it won’t order members to stop wearing the organisation’s military uniform. The organisation says the attire is part of its legacy and history. The remark comes after the MKMVA in the Eastern Cape called on the ANC to stop MKMVA members from wearing the regalia. The association’s provincial secretary, Petros Vantyu,  says the wearing of the uniform is in contravention with the resolutions of their 54th conference. He adds that some people use it to advance factional politics within the party and this compromises the dignity of uMkhonto we Sizwe. “It’s been misused many times. Sometimes we are misrepresented by people who are marching and not marching in a proper way in our funerals. It has been used by people who are demanding this and that from government, whereas there are processes that people should follow in engaging government structures and the Department of Military Veterans. In fact, it really misrepresents what MK stood for. It has been used for factional battles of the ANC by people with nefarious motives.” MKMVA President, Kebby Maphatsoe, says the organisation’s top leadership will not allow for members to do so. “Our uniform is our legacy, our history and heritage and we cannot throw it away. Anyone who has got a view that you must not wear a uniform must know the conference is the highest decision-making body that can take that decision; not anyone who is speaking in the media and just wants to be seen. This is organisational and is about our history.”
