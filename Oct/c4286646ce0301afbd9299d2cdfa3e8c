The African National Congress (ANC) in the Waterberg District of Limpopo is calling on the provincial government to place the opposition-run municipalities, Thabazimbi and Modimolle-Mookgophong, under administration. The municipalities are governed by coalition of the Democratic Alliance, the Economic Freedom Fighters, Thabazimbi Residents Association and Freedom Front Plus, since after the 2016 Local Government Elections. ANC Waterberg District Spokesperson Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala says the municipalities are insolvent saying they cannot pay the creditors. Moremi-Taueatsoala says, “Both municipalities were found wanting in areas of financial mismanagement and do nothing to enforce consequence management on audit reports in Thabazimbi. The NCOP delegation was supposed to learn that there was an over-reliance on consultants in the area of finance, Gwith no efforts both municipalities are insolvent and cannot pay their creditors.” In the video below, DA won control of Modimolle-Mookgopong Municipality in 2016: Recommendations Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu says there is a growing trend of municipalities that are not following recommendations from the audit office but has indicated that they now have the power to issue binding recommendations.
