Former KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner, Mammonye Ngobeni, and former police Captain, Ashwin Narainparshad, have been granted bail of R20 000 and R10 000, respectively, at the Durban Magistrate’s Court. The pair handed themselves over at the court on Monday morning. They now join Durban businessman Thoshan Panday and former police Colonel, Navin Madhoe, in facing fraud charges related to alleged tender fraud regarding 2010 Soccer World Cup accommodation for police officers. The former KwaZulu-Natal top cop handed herself in, three days after police sounded the call for them to do so. She appeared calm in the dock. Ngobeni appeared alongside former police Captain Ashwin Narainparshad. Last week, Panday and Madhoe were released on R100 000 and R10 000 bail respectively. Panday is alleged to have inflated prices in the police accommodation tender and raked in millions in the process. At the time that the tender was awarded, Madhoe was working in the SAPS’ Supply Chain Management Unit. Ngobeni is accused of defeating the ends of justice for allegedly trying to stop investigations against Panday. The State also alleges that Panday paid R26-million for Ngobeni’s husband’s birthday party in 2010.
