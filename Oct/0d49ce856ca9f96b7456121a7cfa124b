The Special Tribunal of South Africa hears the arguments in the matter between the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and 40 Gauteng-based contractors involved in the implementation of the supply and delivery of COVID-19 Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). The hearings were occasioned by an earlier urgent application (on 20 August 2020) where the Special Tribunal granted an interim on order freezing R38, 7 million held in several bank accounts of the contractors cited as respondents.
