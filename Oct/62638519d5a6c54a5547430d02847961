The state in the matter of former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s wife, Noma, says there has been an attempt by the defence to interfere with state witnesses. Gigaba has briefly appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s court where she is facing charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. The matter has been postponed to February 12, next year, for further investigations and for the outcome of the proceedings in the High Court where she challenged the validity of her arrest in July. Gigaba allegedly damaged a Mercedes Benz G-Wagon allegedly belonging to her estranged husband’s associate. Her lawyer Victor Nkhwashu says they’re not aware of any attempts by the defence to interfere with witnesses. “It was also brought to our attention that there’s an attempt from some in the defence side who has attempted to make contact with state witnesses. You will recall in the motion proceedings there were different lawyers, different parties who were applicants and respondents, so we need to find out which one of these parties may have made such contact. As far as my client and I are aware we are not aware of any such interference.”
