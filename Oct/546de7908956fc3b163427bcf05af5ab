Cooperate Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, is expected to visit two multi-billion rand state of the art bridge projects at Lusikisiki and Mbizana in the Eastern Cape. Mtentu Msikaba bridge will act as a catalyst along the economic corridor that connects the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal from Ingquza Hill Municipality and Mbizana Local Municipality to the Ugu District Municipality in KZN. The total construction cost is R3.8 billion. At 1.100 metres in length, the bridge will be the longest bridge on the continent. The height of the bridge is 223 metres, which makes it one of the highest in Africa. The Wild Coast N2 Toll Road will cut through the beautiful coastal land from East London to KwaZulu-Natal. The quality road and infrastructure will facilitate inter-provincial trade. The project has since opened up job opportunities and emerging construction companies are benefiting from the project. The Minister will also visit the Lambasi Waterfalls and possible new developments along the wild coast.
