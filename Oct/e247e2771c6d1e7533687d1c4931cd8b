The state in the Pastor Timothy Omotoso rape case says there’s a strong possibility that the accused would be deported if he is granted bail. The state and defence are at loggerheads over Omotoso’s documentation, after he was declared a prohibited person by Home Affairs. This is the third bail application, forcing the postponement of the trial. Omotoso and two co-accused are charged with more that 90 sex-related charges including human trafficking, rape and sexual assault.  Investigating officer of the Hawks, warrant officer Peter Plaatjies said since Omotoso’s arrest in April 2017, they could not get hold of his two passports. They are  in the possession of his attorney, and they were only given copies thereof. Defence advocate Terry Price argued that an illegal foreigner may be granted bail, with strict conditions and then the Dept of Home Affairs would have no say. Meanwhile, the threatening messages received by some victims must still be translated from various African languages. In this video, Pastor Timothy Omotoso is back in court
