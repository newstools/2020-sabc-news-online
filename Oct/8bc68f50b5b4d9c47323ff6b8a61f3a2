Voter registration for the country’s December by-elections has kicked off. Twenty-four municipal ward by-elections are scheduled to take place in all nine provinces on December 9. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has said 118 voting stations will open on Saturday and Sunday from 08h00 to 17h00. The registration weekend will allow all eligible voters to register while already registered voters will get an opportunity to check their registration details and provide updates where applicable. “Voters should take their identity document (ID) with them either a green barcoded ID book, a smartcard ID, or a valid Temporary ID Certificate. They will also need to complete their physical home address on registration or provide sufficient particularities of their place of residence. Documented proof of address (e.g. a municipal account) is not required.” Voters may also check and update their details at their local IEC office weekdays during office hours. The IEC says voters are reminded that it is a criminal offence to register and vote in a ward in which they are not ordinarily resident. Full statement below:
