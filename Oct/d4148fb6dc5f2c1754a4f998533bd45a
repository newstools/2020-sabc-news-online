The Gauteng Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) will on Monday hold a march in Johannesburg to demand the arrest of Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula. The organisation accuses Mbalula of doing nothing about the severely crippled and vandalised rail system in the country. Only 7 of Metrorail’s 34 commuter lines currently are in operation. The association’s other grievances include rampant corruption in the country, gender-based violence as well as youth unemployment. The march will be supported by the South African National Civic Organistion (SANCO) and the Congress of South African Students (COSAS).
