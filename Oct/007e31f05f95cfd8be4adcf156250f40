The World Health Organization is South Sudan has provided over four oxygen concentrators and other essential drugs to the State in Awiel for those in isolation to use. The WHO in South Sudan produced these in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which has heavily impacted the world in its entirety. An oxygen concentrator is a device that concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream. Two methods in common use are pressure swing adsorption and membrane gas separation. The oxygen concentrators provided by WHO were received in support from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office as well as the EU in South Sudan. To support the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, @WHOSouthSudan has handed over 4 oxygen concentrators & other essential drugs to the state #MoH in Awiel for use in the isolation unit. The oxygen concentrators were procured with support from @FCDOGovUK & @EUinSouthSudan. pic.twitter.com/23MWlMWeQb â€” WHO South Sudan (@WHOSouthSudan) October 3, 2020
