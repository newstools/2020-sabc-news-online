As part of the birthday celebrations of the late and longest serving African National Congress (ANC) president Oliver Tambo, President Cyril Ramaphosa has unveiled a nine-metre tall bronze statue at the OR Tambo Airport. Tambo would have been 103-years-old today. He led the ANC in exile under difficult times and delivered numerous landmark speeches to the UN General Assembly calling for action against the apartheid government. Below is the video of the unveiling of the statue:  Meanwhile, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina says: “Oliver Tambo was larger than life. He presided over the ANC during the most difficult time in our struggle. For over five decades he was in the leadership of the ANC. It is only befitting that as a region and as a country, we honour his legacy and his contribution and we basically want to make sure that his legacy does not disappear”. The ANC in Gauteng will lay a wreath at Tambo’s graveside. Celebrations are also planned at his birthplace in Ikantolo village in the Eastern Cape.
