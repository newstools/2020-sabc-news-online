Former BOSASA chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi has spent a second day in hospital in Johannesburg where his condition has been described as stable. He was admitted to hospital on Thursday, after spending one night in jail. Agrizzi was denied bail on Wednesday, after being deemed a flight risk. He faces charges related to four tenders awarded to BOSASA and its subsidiaries valued at over R1.8 billion between 2004 and 2007. The contracts included rendering of catering and training services, installation of CCTV cameras and fencing. The fraud and corruption case of Agrizzi and co-accused, former Correctional Services Commissioner Linda Mti, former Chief financial officer Patrick Gillingham and former BOSASA Executive Andries van Tonder has been postponed to November 26.
