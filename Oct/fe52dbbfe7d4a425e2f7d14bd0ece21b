The State Capture Commission on Tuesday is expected to hear Eskom related evidence from the former Eskom Board Chairperson Dr. Ben Ngubane. In September, Ngubane appeared before the Commission testifying about his tenure as the SABC board chair, during which time, former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela made damning findings in her 2014, “When Governance and Ethics fail” report.  The Commission has already heard evidence by former Eskom chair Zola Tsotsi.
