South African Airways Technical has lifted its maintenance suspension to Mango and other airlines over non-payment. SAA has settled its outstanding debt with SAAT, while Mango reached an agreement. Last week, the SAA subsidiary entered into talks with Mango to find a resolution on outstanding payment for services rendered. The cash-strapped aircraft maintenance service provider released a statement that the decision was taken to protect its commercial interest. The airline industry has suffered a huge blow as a result of the coronavirus pandemic which has grounded airlines across the globe and SAAT has not been exempted from the sector’s woes. Last month, SAAT cash flow challenges became more apparent when it paid its employees 25% of their salaries. While management has since apologised for the inconvenience, talks with labour on the money owed to workers continues. Mango Airline resolves technical issue with the SAA:  Mango services were not interrupted during the cause of the talks with the service provider as well as SAA’s planned chartered flights.
