The Pretoria Magistrate’s Court has granted the media permission to broadcast live the court proceedings of Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) pastor Shepherd Bushiri and his co-accused. Bushiri, his wife Mary and Landiwe Ntlokwana are charged with fraud, money laundering and contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. They are expected to bring formal bail applications on Friday. Due to COVID-19 regulations, the number of people allowed in court is limited. The state and Bushiri’s legal team both opposed the application for the proceedings to be carried live. Bushiri and his co-accused were arrested on Tuesday and have been in custody since, spending the last two nights at Kgosi Mampuru maximum prison. Bushiri and wife’s court appearance on fraud charges:  The church earlier said in a statement it believes the state and police are acting maliciously in the case against the couple as spiritual leaders of millions of people. Meanwhile, Bushiri also indicated through a statement that he doesn’t understand the charges against him. He says he is not a businessman but a religious person who lives by strict principles. The Bushiri’s will remain in custody while the state and defence battle it out in court on their possible release. Scores of Bushiri’s supporters continue to protest in front of the court building.
