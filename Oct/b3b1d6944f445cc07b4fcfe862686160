A 42-year-old man has appeared in the Warrenton Magistrate’s Court in the Northern Cape in connection with the murder of a four-year-old child. Kotoi Vannek was arrested and appeared in court following the discovery of the child’s body stuffed in a box. The boy had multiple stab wounds. During his appearance, Vannek insisted that he had nothing to do with the child’s disappearance or death. He is facing a charge of premeditated murder and is expected to apply for bail when he next appears in the court on October 26. The boy’s aunt, Kelebogile Sala, says the family is still reeling from the murder. “I really can’t take what he did. I am really hurt by this. There must be justice for our child. He cannot possibly just go on with life after doing such a terrible thing to a child. I am begging them not to give him bail. I cannot even stand being in the same courtroom as him.” The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it will aim to keep Vannek behind bars for the duration of the trial. NPA’s Mojalefa Senokotsoane, says: “The accused will make his second appearance at the Warrenton Magistrate’s Court to officially apply for bail. The prosecution will be opposing bail looking at the seriousness against the accused. Kotoi Vannek will be remanded in custody.”
