Efforts have been made across China to overcome the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and other disasters and make new progresses in poverty alleviation, said the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development on Saturday. WHO team heads to China to investigate the origin of COVID-19:  The new progress has been made especially in encouraging labour in poverty-stricken areas to work away from home and in supervising the work of poverty alleviation in the most impoverished counties, said the office. Steps have been taken to speed up solving new problems caused by disasters, such as the safety of housing and drinking water. Various supporting policies have been earnestly implemented, and key poverty alleviation tasks have been steadily advanced, said the office. “The work to stabilize employment and increase jobs is particularly effective. To date, there have been 29.34 million labourers from impoverished areas gone out to work, an increase of 2.05 million over last year. Nine provinces and municipalities in eastern region have further increased their efforts to stabilise jobs and absorbed 7.935 million people from poverty-stricken areas in central and western regions, accounting for 97% of the total absorbed workforce in 2019,” said Wang Chunyan, deputy director of the office’s general department. In 2020, more than 2.95 million people from 52 counties under supervision have gone out to work. Eleven provinces and municipalities in central and eastern regions have mobilised 1,474 private enterprises and 659 social organisation to offer help to 1.113 poverty-stricken villages under supervision. By now, 22 provinces in central and western regions have provided public welfare jobs to more than 4.94 impoverished people. In terms of poverty relief efforts through consumption, 22 provinces in central and western regions have designated a total of 117.574 products for poverty alleviation, involving 1.778 counties and 33.976 suppliers, which already claimed a sales volume of 171.518 billion yuan (25.63 billion U.S. dollars).
