African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule’s lawyer says no arrest warrant has been issued for the arrest of his client. This comes after reports that Magashule would be arrested by the Hawks on Wednesday in connection with the Vrede dairy farm project in the Free State. This follows a number of recent high-profile arrests in the past week. Attorney, Victor Nkwashu, says he will write to all relevant authorities to ascertain the source of rumours that the arrest of his client is imminent. “As you would know that there is also a unit called the Investigating Directorate (ID) within the office of the National Prosecuting Authority, headed by Advocate Hermione Cronje. They have not responded and we have an instruction to engage with National Director of Public Prosecutions head, Advocate Shamila Batohi [and] Advocate Cronje as well as the Hawks to find out if this article has any truth into it,” explains Nkwashu. Magashule’s lawyer Victor Nkwashu was interviewed on SAFM’s Sunrise:  Hawks deny arrest allegations Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi has confirmed that various media reports detailing the alleged arrest warrant for Magashule is fake news. Speaking to SABC News, Mulaudzi says the Hawks issued a brief statement calling the reports of Magashule’s impending arrest a malicious intent to undermine the integrity of the organisation.
