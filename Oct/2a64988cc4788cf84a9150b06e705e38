A 52-year-old farmer from Marquard has been arrested on charges of malicious damage to property and public violence and will appear in the local magistrate’s court on Friday. 52-year-old man arrested following damage to property and torching of a police vehicle in Senekal:  The farmers went on the rampage and stormed the court, where two men appeared briefly in connection with the murder of farm manager, Brendon Horner. The farmers also torched a police vehicle. The Police Minister’s spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, says there should be more arrests as the 52-year-old farmer did not act alone. “The minister of police wants more arrests saying that ‘yes, I welcome this 52-year old farmer that has been nabbed, but also he didn’t act alone; there were more people. There is plenty of footage of people storming the court building, plenty of footage of people trying to access the Inyala that was parked outside the court building, and we are of the view that more people have a case to answer to.’” Free State police spokesperson Baile Motswenyane says investigations into the matter are continuing and more arrests are imminent.
