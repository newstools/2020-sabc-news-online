Two City of Cape Town firefighters have been treated in hospital after they were assaulted in Wallacedene, near Kraaifontein on Saturday morning. The crew from Brackenfell had responded to a fire in the area. They were accosted by three men who threatened them at gunpoint and robbed them of their belongings before assaulting them. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, has appealed to anyone with information about the incident to contact the City or their nearest police station. He believes that it was an ambush of frontline staff. “It turned out there was no structural fire as reported, which makes it clear that this was an ambush. Attacks on the City’s frontline staff are becoming all too commonplace, especially our firefighters. These officials provide a lifesaving service and every incident of this nature chips away the trust between the fire service and the communities they serve.”  Two City of Cape Town firefighters have been treated in hospital after they were assaulted in Wallacedene this morning….
