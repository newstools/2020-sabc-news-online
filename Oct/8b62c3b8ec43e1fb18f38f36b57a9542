Police Minister Bheki Cele says his department is working on assisting farmers and law enforcement officials to work together to avoid stock theft and farm violence. Cele and State Security Minister, Ayanda Dlodlo, met with farmers in the Free State on Tuesday, following violent protests in Senekal. This comes ahead of the bail application of two suspects accused of the murder of farm manager, Brendin Horner. SABC News’ Aphumelele Mdlalane elaborates on the case and the Ministers’ visit:  Cele says farmers and police need to work together to stop violent attacks. “There is a big will for police and the farming community to work together, especially on the very troubling issue of the stock theft and that is happening to all farmers. It is on that issue that we have agreed to go back there and see how do we work on matters of three police stations that they have raised,” explains Cele.
