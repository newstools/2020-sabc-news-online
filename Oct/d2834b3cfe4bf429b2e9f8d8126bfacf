KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says preliminary investigations have revealed that the vehicle in which 12 members of the Mndali family were killed a week ago was not registered as a taxi. He was speaking at their funeral service at Kilmun near Underberg. Zikalala says 106 people have died and 77 others were critically injured in road crashes in the province since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown. He says that road carnage in the province is a challenge that needs to be urgently addressed. Zikalala has urged motorists to be cautious. “The vehicle was not licensed and that is one of the problems since the country entered Level one, we have had 77 car accidents….. and we and we have lost 106 lives. This is terrible and that’s why we are saying that out of this tragedy let us learn, let us be responsible in whatever we’re doing or wherever we are whilst we are driving.” In the video below, SABC News speaks to Zikalala at the funeral service:
