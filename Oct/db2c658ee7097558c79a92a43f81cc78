Acting Gauteng Health MEC Jacob Mamabolo says the high number of vacancies in health facilities can seriously affect the department’s ability to deliver quality services to communities if unattended. This has resulted in the department incurring over three-million-rand in the payment of acting allowances between April and September this year. About 78 vacancies were registered in the same period. Twenty-four of those are for senior management positions. There is also a vacancy for the Head of the Department after Professor Mkhululi Lukhele resigned from the post in the wake of the personal protective equipment scandal in the province. Gauteng Health spokesperson Kwara Kekana says, “It is unacceptable that we have such a high rate of positions where people are in an acting capacity, more so at senior management level. MEC Mamabolo, he further stated that this has led to the weakening of governance within the institution and if left unattended for longer, it will have a dire impact on the Department’s ability to deliver quality healthcare services to the people of Gauteng.”
