The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) is due to start the process of evaluating the assets that belong to Blackhead Consulting CEO, Edwin Sodi, in Gauteng. This follows last week’s arrest of seven people linked to the over R250 million Free State asbestos contract. The accused have until Wednesday to notify the Bloemfontein High Court if they intend to oppose the provisional order to freeze their assets. Seven people and five companies face more than 60 charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. The High Court in Bloemfontein granted the Asset Forfeiture Unit the provisional order last Wednesday to freeze the accused’s assets, including bank accounts, worth R300 million. Eleven beneficiaries, including family trusts, have also been cited in court papers. The accused include former Free State Human Settlements MEC and ousted Mangaung Metro executive mayor, Olly Mlamleli. They were released on bail ranging between R50 000 and R500 000. They will be back in court on November 11. In the video below, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the arrested suspects were implicated in Free State asbestos project:
