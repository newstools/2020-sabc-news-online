Five suspects including the husband of a businesswoman, who was shot and killed execution-style in Polokwane in Limpopo two weeks ago, have been arrested in different parts of Gauteng. Forty-six-year-old Makoena Mabusela-Leshabane and 35-year-old Tebogo Mphuti were shot while they were in a luxury car at an industrial site. They were viewing business properties. Police Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says the 56-year-old husband was arrested in hospital where he was admitted after he allegedly drank poison. Different police units effected the arrest in the early hours of Thursday morning in Katlegong, Eiseberg, Germiston and Ekurhuleni. The red Hyundai which was used as getaway car, two firearms, two magazines and thirteen live round of ammunition were also confiscated. The suspects aged 25 and 58 face charges of murder and the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Police deny murder of women is rife in Polokwane Meanwhile, police have denied suggestions that the murder of women is rife in Polokwane. Three weeks ago, an 83-year-old pensioner was stabbed to death in her room at an old age home. In September, a woman and her daughter were also stabbed to death at their home. Mojapelo says the latest incident appears to be a hit. “We really can’t say this is rife because so far, what we can detect is that it appears to be a hit because nothing was taken from the vehicle; they just came and approached the vehicle and shot the occupants at point-blank. We are not sure of the motive, but our investigations obviously are continuing so we will make a determination after we make arrests.” Police told the property agent who witnessed the incident asked not to speak to the media.
