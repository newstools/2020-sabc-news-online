Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, has ordered that a summons be issued for former president, Jacob Zuma to appear before the State Capture Commission from the 16th to the 20th of November. The State Capture Commission evidence leader, Advocate Paul Pretorius says there are compelling reasons for former President Jacob Zuma to appear before the commission. The commission is hearing an application by its legal team for an order authorising the secretary of the commission to issue a summons for Zuma. Earlier, Zuma said his appearance before the commission set for next month will be an inconvenience. He has also called for its Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to recuse himself citing his biasedness. However, Pretorius says it is not unusual to issue summons to a witness. He says many people have been summoned and that over 30 witnesses have also implicated Zuma. The below video is Friday’s live stream:  Meanwhile, in a statement released by the JG Zuma Foundation, Zuma expressed concern that his plea for the recusal of Zondo has fallen on deaf ears. The JG Zuma Foundation argues that it is not fair for Zondo to expect Zuma to make an appearance, while he has not responded to the request for his recusal. Last month, Justice Zondo said if Zuma or his lawyers don’t appear on Friday, he will proceed with the application to compel him to appear before the Commission.
