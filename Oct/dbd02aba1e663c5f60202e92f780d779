Action SA leader Herman Mashaba is pursuing a private prosecution against Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo and former Mayor Parks Tau. In 2018 Mashaba, the then Mayor of the City of Johannesburg laid charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering against Makhubo and Tau at the Johannesburg central police station. This followed a report by the Amabhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism on how Makhubo and Tau had allegedly benefited from millions of rand after Makhubo unduly acting as a broker for Regiments Fund Managers. Makhubo has denied the allegations. Mashaba says the NPA and the Hawks have now informed him that they have no record of the criminal case lodged against Makhubo and Tau. Action SA national spokesperson Lerato M-Ngobeni says Mashaba is, however, pursuing other legal avenues. “Neither the NPA nor the Hawks or state says that they don’t have any record of the criminal charges lodged against Makhubo and for us, that is really suspicious and so we are pursuing other legal avenues to find what has happened to the case against Makhubo that has seemingly gone missing.” The NPA in Gauteng has told us that neither the NPA nor the HAWKS have any record of the criminal case lodged against @GeoffMakhubo. I laid criminal charges against both Makhubo and Parks Tau on 10 December 2018 How has the criminal case into Geoff Makhubo gone missing? pic.twitter.com/CoWuxpvIfi — Herman Mashaba (@HermanMashaba) October 26, 2020  Investigations alleged how the wives of both former Mayor and now Deputy Minister, Parks Tau, and @GeoffMakhubo benefitted from share growth from R3 to R50 million through a consortium deal involving Regiments Capital. — Herman Mashaba (@HermanMashaba) October 26, 2020  SAPS & the NPA are completely failing to fulfill their Constitutional mandate. This is why we are initiating private prosecutions.https://t.co/DYMo11I0KH — Herman Mashaba (@HermanMashaba) October 26, 2020
