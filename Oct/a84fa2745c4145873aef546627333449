Scientists are warning of a second surge in coronavirus cases in South Africa over the next few weeks. Wits University Professor Bruce Milado, who’s also a member of the Gauteng COVID-19 Advisory Committee, says the model his team is using shows that the risk of the second surge is high. The team has been monitoring countries like France and Spain which experienced a peak in infections in March. The situation stabilised in the middle of the year but has peaked yet again. 1 575 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in South Africa in the past 24-hour cycle. #COVID19 Statistics in SA as at 11 October.

The likelihood or the probability of a second, third or fourth surge increases if sections of the populations do not adhere to social distancing. The more strict we adhere to social distancing the lesser probability of a second surge,” adds Milado.
