Police Minister Bheki Cele says he is confident that those involved in the murder of former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, Senzo Meyiwa, will be prosecuted. This comes after drama unfolded at the case of five suspects arrested in connection with Meyiwa’s murder. The suspects, who are facing charges of murder, being in possession of an unlicensed firearm and robbery with aggravating circumstances said they had nothing to do with the crime. In the video below, the suspects appear before court:  Cele spoke to SABC News at the launch of national safer festive season in Qwaqwa, in the Free State, on Friday. “Well I am not a lawyer, I am not a prosecutor, I am not magistrate but I am told people have been arrested, I have been told we are expecting extra arrests, I am told that for the fact that they were arrested remember this case has been long and police worked closely with prosecution and the warrants were given. We believe when those things happened is because somebody has looked at the case and realized that case is strong.” On Tuesday, advocacy group – AfriForum- said they believe there is a strong case against those arrested for the murder. Advocate Gerrie Nel elaborates on developments in the Senzo Meyiwa case:  The five suspects have been remanded in custody. They were arrested on the same day Meyiwa was murdered in Vosloorus,in Ekurhuleni, six years ago. Some of them are serving prison sentences, while others are awaiting trial for separate crimes. The case has been postponed to November 27.
