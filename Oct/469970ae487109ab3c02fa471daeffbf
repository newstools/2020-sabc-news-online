Parktown Boys’ High Principal, Malcolm Williams has been fired for charges related to the drowning of Enoch Mpianzi at a Grade eight orientation camp in January. He had been charged with three counts of misconduct. Gauteng Education Department Spokesperson, Steve Mabona says Williams was found guilty on two of the three charges. “It is alleged that Mr Williams caused the school to undertake an excursion where they were taking Grade 8s for an orientation and he also failed to make sure that there’s a roll call that was taken before the learners could undertake this process. So the lack of approval that was given by the Department then caused him to be charged – there was no approval from the Department was given or granted,” says Mabona. He adds that Williams was found not guilty on a count of putting the children’s lives at risk, by not ensuring they were wearing life jackets. “The third misconduct was that he did not take the necessary safety precautions which might have led to the death of one learner – making sure that all learners have safety vests and all that.” Williams was suspended for a short period after the incident. Mpianzi’s death sparked a public outcry. His family has served the Education Department with a lawsuit. Gauteng Education confirms dismissing Parktown Boy’s High principal:
