Gautrain has on Saturday announced that its operations will continue on Sunday with limited-service. Operations were suspended on Saturday due to a strike by workers affiliated with National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) over wage negotiations. “On Sunday, 11 October, a limited Gautrain service will operate from 09h00 until 18h00 on both the East-West and North-South lines. Trains will be available every hour from both directions.” We are pleased to confirm that we are able to provide a limited train service tomorrow, 11 October. pic.twitter.com/2GqbX75uIm — Gautrain (@TheGautrain) October 10, 2020  Earlier this week, Numsa workers  at the Gautrain embarked on an indefinite strike. They were picketing at the Midrand depot of the company that runs the Gautrain, Bombela Operations Company, demanding an 8% wage increase. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says the company has offered a 4% increase without engaging or negotiating with them. “At the heart of the strike is the fact that management doesn’t want to meaningfully engage with us as the employees. They are trying to impose a 4.1% increase; our members are demanding an 8% increase. We believe very strongly as Numsa that between us and the management of Gautrain that we can find one another, we are not that far from each other. We need an opportunity to engage meaningfully.” Gautrain services affected by Numsa strike:
