Two of the four people accused in the double murder of a Polokwane businesswoman and her mother will on Tuesday hear the verdict on their bail application in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo. The matter was postponed last week to allow the defence to prepare its arguments after the state submitted arguments opposing bail. The victims, Lizette Deacon and her mother Hettie were murdered in their home in Welgelegen in Polokwane last month. Their bodies were discovered inside their abandoned car near the R37 off-ramp, outside Polokwane. The state is opposing bail arguing that accused number two, Casper Mudau, is a flight risk. Mudau who is a Zimbabwean national is suspected of being in the country illegally. The state also argues that accused number three, Sophie Mmako, has provided the investigating officer with more than two residential addresses. Mmako is also suspected of being the mastermind behind the attack. The four accused are facing charges of house robbery, kidnapping and murder. They have been remanded in custody.
