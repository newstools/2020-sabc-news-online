The lives of more than 3 000 South Africans are at risk due to critical nationwide blood shortages. The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) has called eligible donors to urgently assist. The coronavirus pandemic has impacted regular mobile blood drives at corporate sites, schools and universities. We need at least 3500 units of blood to meet the national demand each day. We ask donors to please donate blood. Your one unit of blood can save up to three lives. #YoungBlood pic.twitter.com/mQ2oJebW9D — The SANBS (@theSANBS) October 6, 2020  SANBS Spokesperson Khensani Mahlangu says at least 3 500 units of blood are needed to meet the national demand. “We are reaching out to the public to make available public spaces where ever we can host our mobile blood drives. We are also reaching out to the youth, anyone between the ages of 16 and 35 who is healthy enough and fits the donation criteria to please visit their nearest blood donor centre. We need blood.
