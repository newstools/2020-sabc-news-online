The affected parties will have to file their answering affidavits within 15 days of notifying the Asset Forfeiture Unit of their intention to oppose the provisional restraint order. The accused include former Free State Human Settlements MEC and ousted Mangaung Metro Executive Mayor, Olly Mlamleli, and businessman Edwin Sodi. They were released on bail ranging between R50 000 and R500 000. They will be back in court on October 11th. Hawks arrest the suspects:
