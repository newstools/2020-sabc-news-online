The third bail application of Pastor Timothy Omotoso is expected to continue at the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday. Details around the dramatic arrest of Omotoso at the Port Elizabeth airport in 2017, were argued in court on Wednesday, where his defence advocate, Terry Price told the court that Omotoso came to Port Elizabeth voluntarily to be interviewed by his legal team and the Hawks, only to be arrested. Omotoso and his two co-accused Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Solani face several sex related charges involving young women from his Jesus Dominion International Church. Department of Home Affairs officials have confirmed that Omotoso is still a prohibited person in the country and was declared prohibited after his arrest, but this was uplifted by the High Court after Omotoso appealed against it in 2019. Meanwhile, the Department of Home Affairs declared him a prohibited person again three weeks ago, as he has no legal documents or permits and could be deported should he get bail. Omotoso’s lawyer, Price says the court can issue an order with strict restrictions which could include an amount to be paid, house arrest, and that he reports to court for the trial. Timothy Omotoso’s bail application continues  Investigating officer of the Hawks, warrant officer Peter Plaatjies said since Omotoso’s arrest in April 2017, they could not get hold of his two passports. They are in the possession of his attorney, and they were only given copies thereof. Defence advocate Price argued that an illegal foreigner may be granted bail, with strict conditions and then the Dept of Home Affairs would have no say. Meanwhile, the threatening messages received by some victims must still be translated from various African languages. In this video, Pastor Timothy Omotoso is back in court
