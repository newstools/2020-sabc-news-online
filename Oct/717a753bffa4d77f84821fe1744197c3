The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement is presented to Parliament a week later than initially agreed to after Treasury asked for the extension due to the complex and unusual circumstances they have to consider. In a statement, Treasury indicated that government is determined to maintain a prudent fiscal stance which is in the best interest of the country in the medium and long-term. Besides this, the National Assembly will among others, discuss the appointment of the new Auditor General, Tsakane Maluleka, when the non-renewable term of Kimi Makwetu comes to an end and the National Council of Provinces will host an oral question and answer session for President Cyril Ramaphosa. More than 40 committee meetings are also scheduled to take place where several bills will be discussed.
