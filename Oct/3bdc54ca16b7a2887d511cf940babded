Enlightened Christian Gathering Church (ECG) leader, Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, are expected to apply for bail in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Friday morning. The Bushiri’s were arrested earlier this week, and are facing charges of fraud, money laundering and contraventions of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act worth R102 million. The charges relate to an investment in one of Bushiri’s companies, “Rising Estate”. The video below is reporting on Bushiri and wife’s court appearance on fraud charges:  The church earlier said in a statement it believes the state and police are acting maliciously in the case against the couple as spiritual leaders of millions of people. Meanwhile, Bushiri also indicated through a statement that he doesn’t understand the charges against him. He says he is not a businessman but a religious person who lives by strict principles. The Bushiri’s will remain in custody while the state and defence battle it out in court on their possible release. It’s expected that scores of Bushiri’s supporters will continue to protest in front of the court building. The video below is reporting on Bushiri’s July court appearance:
