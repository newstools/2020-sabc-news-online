Former eThekwini Metro Zandile Gumede is scheduled to appear before the ANC’s Integrity Commission next week. ANC branches supporting Gumede feel her appearance should be put on hold until the NPA has presented her with charges. Gumede was arrested in May last year and is out on R50 000 bail. She is accused of conniving with some companies and municipal officials to manipulate the city’s multi-million waste removal tender. Spokesperson for ANC branches supporting Gumede, Mzo Dube says the former mayor will not have anything to present to the commission as the NPA has not presented her with the charge “In the case of mama Gumede, we have a problem that only talks to the allegations that have been hanging for more than a year, there are no formal charges until now. So when you present yourself to the committee, you ought to present your position in terms of these are the charges, this is what you know about these charges, this was your role in these charges. At this particular instance,  there is none of such and therefore, we are saying it is premature for umama to go and present herself before the integrity commission.” In the video below, the case against Gumede is postponed:
