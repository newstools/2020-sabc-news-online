It would be necessary to reduce speed on wet roads and to keep a safe following distance as cars skew out of control when braking harshly on roads that are wet. It is necessary to ensure that wiper blades and brakes are in a good condition  and the drivers should keep the headlights switched on to increase visibility in heavy rain.”
