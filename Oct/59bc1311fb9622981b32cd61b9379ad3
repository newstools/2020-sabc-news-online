Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wished President Donald Trump a “rapid recovery” in a Facebook message on Friday night, shortly before the US President arrived at a Washington-era military hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. President Trump has been moved  to hospital as a precautionary measure:  “I wish for a rapid recovery for the President of the USA, Donald Trump, and the first lady, Melania,” he wrote. “With faith in God, they will soon recover and the work of managing the country and his re-election campaign will not be affected.” Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a message of sympathy to President Donald Trump, wishing him well and hoping he quickly recovers from the coronavirus, North Korean state media said on Saturday. Kim offered his sympathy and “warm greetings” to Trump and his wife, KCNA reported. “He sincerely hoped that they would be recovered as soon as possible,” KCNA said. “He hoped they will surely overcome it.” Trump and Kim developed an unprecedented relationship, staging the first meetings between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader, and Trump once declared that they “fell in love” after exchanging letters.
