The South African Students’ Congress (SASCO) is expected to embark on a national day of action on Wednesday – to raise awareness over, what it calls, a dire condition of TVET colleges across the country. The student body says its march will include visits to premiers’ offices across all nine provinces – including protest action at the Union Building in Pretoria.

TVETS across the country are in a dire situation. They have buildings that are collapsing, TVET students don’t have accommodation that is afforded to students in universities. We don’t want to continue to listen to the lip service of government when it comes to the beginning of every academic year. We want government to act now,” says Luyolo Barnes, SASCO’s Spokesperson.
