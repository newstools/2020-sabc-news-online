Acting Gauteng Health MEC Jacob Mamabolo says the high number of vacancies in health facilities should be addressed urgently as they can seriously affect the department’s ability to deliver quality services to communities. The department has paid more than R3 million for acting allowances between April and September this year. About 78 vacancies were registered in the same period. 24 of these are for senior management positions. The post of head of the department is also vacant after the resignation of Professor Mkhululi Lukhele in the wake of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) scandal in the province. “It is unacceptable that we have such a high rate of positions where people are in an acting capacity, more so at the senior management level. MEC Mamabolo further stated that this has led to the weakening of governance within the institution and if left unattended for longer it will have a dire impact on the department’s ability to deliver quality healthcare services to the people of Gauteng,” says Gauteng Health Spokesperson Kwara Kekana.
