A second wave of the coronavirus appears to be on the horizon for Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape, as the number of infections rise steeply. Acting mayor Tshonono Buyeye says 730 new cases were recorded this week. Motherwell has the most infections with 133 cases, KwaNobuhle has 46, KwaZakhele follows with 45 and Walmer currently has 39 active cases. Buyeye has pleaded with Metro residents to act responsibly. Chairperson of Nelson Mandela Bay Disaster Management, Shane Brown , says people are not complying with lockdown regulations. “We are putting out an appeal to residents as well as businesses to please take all necessary precautions and please wear face masks. Businesses please ensure that they have compliance at the entrances to your businesses and shops. That we ensure we exercise all necessary safety precautions that are out there already. We have regulations and directories are legislated. It is a criminal offense for businesses to not comply,” says Brown.
