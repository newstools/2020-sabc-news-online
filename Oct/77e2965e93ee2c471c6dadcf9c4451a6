Former North West police commissioner William Mpembe has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder relating to the death of three mineworkers and two police officers on 13 August 2012. He appeared at the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Monday. Marikana trial resumes at the North West High Court:  About 200 mineworkers had marched on the day to Lonmin Mines’ Karee Shaft. On their return, they were met by police near the railway line in Marikana. The state says Mpembe, who was the overall commander, gave instructions that teargas and stun grenades be fired into the crowd of miners. This led to a violent confrontation. It is also alleged that Mpembe unlawfully and intentionally gave false information to the Marikana Commission of Inquiry by concealing the fact that he gave the instruction to fire the teargas and stun grenades. Three mineworkers were shot and killed while two police officers sustained serious head injuries when they were attacked by the mineworkers. Five other police officers, Salmon Vermaak, Nkosana Mguye, Collin Mogale, Katlego Sekgweleya and Phillip Makhubela; are standing trial for the death of a mineworker who had taken an R5 rifle from an injured police officer.
