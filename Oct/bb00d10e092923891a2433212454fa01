The Independent Liberation & Allied Workers Union (ILAWU) says they will be protesting in Gauteng on Monday to highlight a lack of jobs for its members. ILAWU says they will be protesting at the Provincial Department of Community Safety, raising concerns over School Patrollers, Traffic Wardens, and Police Reservists who have been put on an employment waiting list. The union says it will also protest outside the office of the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, regarding the running of the province. Stats SA today revealed that 2.2 million South Africans lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and unemployment in the country has dropped to 23.3% in the second quarter of 2020. This is the lowest unemployment rate recorded since 2009. #PutSouthAfricansFirst pic.twitter.com/5arTudswRA — Independent Liberation & Allied Workers Union (@ILAWU_RSA) September 30, 2020  ILAWU President, Thapelo Mafa, says they have tried to engage with the department. “We will be going to the office of the MEC of Safety, Faith Mazibuko, and the office of the Premier to raise our disappointment and unhappiness. They were taken for training in 2016 by the Gauteng Department and they were promised permanent recognition and absorption. It’s 4 years later, we have been engaging with the office of the MEC. We have tried to engage them in letters and meetings to resolve the issues.” Stats SA recently reported that in terms of its expanded definition, which includes people who have stopped looking for work – unemployment increased by 2.3% points to 42% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2020. However, the official unemployment rate fell to 23.3 % in the second quarter of 2020 from 30.1 percent in the previous period. The decline has been attributed to the strict lockdown that distorted labour force numbers. SA 2020 second quarter Unemployment rate by province:
