Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the assault case against him and party MP Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi is nothing but a distraction from focusing on the upcoming Local Government Elections. Malema was addressing members of his party outside the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg where he and Ndlozi appeared. The pair are accused of assaulting Colonel Johannes Venter at the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 2018 when he refused to allow Malema’s vehicle into the cemetery. Defence goes through footage of the incident:  The case has been postponed until March 2021 with new witnesses expected to testify. The revolution and its leadership must be convincingly defended against any form of organised victimisation which wants to cast doubt of the strategic demands of the people! #HandsOffCIC pic.twitter.com/C1gKC87mEd — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) October 28, 2020  Malema urged party members to stay focused on winning the elections. “Because they brought us here to distract us, to de-focus us, fighters do not be de-focused by the enemy. Focus on taking over the municipality, focus on taking over power, focus on removing [President] Cyril Ramaphosa. Focus on removing the corrupt ANC, focus on collapsing capitalism, focus on winning socialism in our lifetime because the future is socialism,” adds the EFF leader.  [MUST WATCH]: CIC @Julius_S_Malema says we must not be defocused by the enemy and worry about the court case. Ours is to focus on taking over municipalities & power. Our focus should be on removing the corrupt government of Ramaphosa and collapsing capitalism. #HandsOffCIC pic.twitter.com/IjRKnGeFjH — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) October 29, 2020
