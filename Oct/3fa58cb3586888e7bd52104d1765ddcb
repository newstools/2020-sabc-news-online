She is leaving behind the husband, a very good husband. She is leaving behind five children, two girls and three boys. We just want them to get the criminals, put them through the justice system and we get justice.” Victims shot execution-style The two ladies arrived in Polokwane on Friday night and booked themselves in a lodging facility. They met with a property agent on Saturday morning, who took them to view a few buildings. While at one building still in the car, three men approached them and without saying anything, opened the driver’s door and allegedly shot the two ladies dead. Police say the three suspects then got into a getaway car which was waiting for them a few metres away. A manhunt for the suspects is still underway.
