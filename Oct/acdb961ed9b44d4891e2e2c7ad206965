The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal says there is nothing wrong with its Member of Provincial Legislature, Zandile Gumede, drawing a salary, even though she is not attending Legislature meetings. Last week, the IFP said it was taking the matter to court, arguing that Gumede should not be drawing a salary while sitting at home. The former eThekwini mayor was sworn-in in August, but was immediately asked by the ANC to step aside pending her appearance before the party’s Integrity Committee. Gumede is facing fraud and corruption charges in relation to a multi-million eThekwini waste removal tender. ANC KZN provincial spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela says there is no legislature which calls for the removal of parliamentarians if they don’t attend meetings. “In the National Assembly you had a number of members including IFP members themselves, the late Ambrosini was absent for how many times in Parliament while he was ill. The late umntwana waKwaMinya he was absent for how many months in the provincial legislature. The late umama Nomzamo Madikizela Mandela was ill for quite a period of time, but she continued to receive her benefits.” Ntombela says, “So there is no law stipulating that a member who is absent for a period then that member must be released from his or her duties. That only applies in local government where if you fail to attend the consecutive meeting without a formal apology then you are expelled.” The video below is on Gumede’s appearance before the ANC integrity commission:
