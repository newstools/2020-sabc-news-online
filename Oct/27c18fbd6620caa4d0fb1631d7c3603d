The newly-appointed king of the AmaXhosa lashed out at those who are attacking his enthronement saying they are disrespecting the Sigcawu Royal Family’s decision to choose him to lead the nation. King Ahlangene Vulikhaya Sigcawu lambasted Prince Xhanti Sigcawu and Chief Daliwonga Mgwebi for speaking against him during an address of traditional leaders in Nqadu Great Place in Willowvale in the Eastern Cape. King Vulikhaya Sigcawu was named as the new AmaXhosa king last week, taking over from his late brother Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu who died last year. The monarch says the kingdom is under attack. “This kingdom has been disrespected not only by Xhanti but also by those who think they can take this kingdom elsewhere. Others made themselves chairpersons of Amatshawe from the Gcaleka house using the kingdom’s letterhead. There’s a newspaper article I saw that was written by Daliwonga, disputing a decision taken by this royal family. He says the AmaRharhabe house was not told about the decision. He wants to cause a rift between the elders and AmaRharhabe. This royal family can take its decisions and inform AmaRharhabe later to make an announcement as a kingdom.” Cracks are showing in the AmaXhosa Royal Kingdom in Eastern Cape  However, the other faction of the AmaXhosa Kingdom led by Prince Xhanti Sigcawu and Chief Mgwebi maintain that proper procedures were not followed in the appointment of the King. Chief Mgwebi was present when King Sigcawu directed media questions to the spokesperson for the AmaRharhabe Kingdom, Prince Burns Ncamashe. “We are not aware of the process having been exhaustively concluded to the extent of arriving at a successor. The discussion is still an internal discussion that is expected to be consistent with the customary practices and processes that govern the house of Phalo. So in a nutshell, what we are saying: when the process is conclusively exhausted the government and the nation will be addressed by the King of AmaRharhabe,” says Chief Mgwebi. The AmaXhosa Royal Kingdom have announced High Commissioner to Malawi Prince Ahlangene Vulikhaya Sigcawu as the New King of AmaXhosa.
There was a notable absence of some senior Royal family members  of the AmaRharharhabe right hand house. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/2K5V2pJQbd — Let there be light!! (@atuleTheJoka) October 16, 2020
