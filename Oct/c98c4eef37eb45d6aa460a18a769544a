Democratic Alliance (DA) Interim Federal Chairperson Ivan Meyer says the party is committed to refocusing on three principles in the lead up to the 2021 local government elections and the person elected to lead the DA will be charged with this as a priority. The party’s first virtual elective congress began this morning. The party’s interim leader John Steenhuisen and member of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature Mbali Ntuli will contest the leadership position. More than 2 000 delegates will decide on who will lead the party in the 2021 polls. Meyer says they will ensure that the elective process is free and fair. On what more will be expected from the elected party leader, he says: “Firstly, to recalibrate the party around the values and principles of the DA. Secondly, to refocus the party as the only viable political vehicle in SA that effect change through alternative and evidence based policy choices. Thirdly, reconnecting with our future voters. Real hope, real change now, there is no time to waste, we will ensure free and fair elections with integrity.  We will encourage robust constructive engaging and democratic debate.” Meyer says that the party’s virtual elective conference will make the party fit for purpose to take South Africa forward. He also made a special mention of farm attacks. “Our farmers, our farm workers and Agri-producers are daily under attack in South Africa this comprises our food security and human dignity in South Africa. This must stop and this must stop now in honour of all our farmers and farmworkers let us hold a moment of silence for those who have fallen. Wherever you are, please rise in support of our farmers and farmworkers and indeed every South African who is a victim of crime in our nation.” Democratic Alliance Elective Federal Congress 2020:
