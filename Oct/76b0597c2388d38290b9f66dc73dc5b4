The State Capture Commission of Inquiry in Johannesburg will on Monday look at allegations of corruption related to arms company Denel. The commission is expected to hear evidence from former board member Nonyameko Mandindi and current chairperson Monhla Hlahla. Mandindi and four other executives resigned in 2017 amid allegations of corruption involving the Denel- Asiaâ€™s joint venture with Gupta linked VR Asia. The then Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown appointed the board in 2015.
