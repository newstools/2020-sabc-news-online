A number of part-time Grade 12 pupils in Mbombela, Mpumalanga are saddened after discovering that their school is not registered with the Department of Education. Some of the learners say they became suspicious after they were not issued with exams timetables. This happens at the time when pupils in the country are preparing to write their final exams. Concerned learners of Edgeview Development Skills Academy in the City of Mbombela, demonstrated outside their school. They are demanding answers from the management of the school after they discovered that the school is bogus. Apparently, the school is using the name of another accredited school. The SABC News team arrived at the school unannounced. The management of the school refused to talk regarding the issue, saying they will release a statement at a later stage. The devastated learners say the school wasted not only their time but also their money. They are calling on the Department of Education to intervene. Head of Examination for the Mpumalanga Education Department, Chukudu Manyabeane, has advised the affected learners to seek assistance from their previous schools. “We cannot run exams from there. Therefore, these learners because they belong elsewhere, let them go to their schools. I’m told by the district some of them are registered with schools that are existing public schools. So, then they will be able to go and write the examination there. They must go to the nearest schools because they are coming from villages, towns, and townships where there are schools and where they studied, where they are known. They can be assisted there. Not at that building which we don’t recognise as a school.” The Department of Education has once again warned people to check if schools are registered before enrolment. Matric pupils will be starting with their exams next week:
