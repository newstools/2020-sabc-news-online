But Malema says Venter should not be allowed to take to the witness stand without the media because when they take the stand the trial is expected to televised.

Malema earlier spoke to the media saying, “They [court proceedings] must all be covered, we want to make them famous, everybody must be covered here. It’s not only us who must be covered here, the magistrate can’t say no today we’re proceeding because it’s a white man who gives an evidence without cameras.” “Then when it is our turn and then she’s going to probably allow cameras to participate inside [the courtroom]. We are not going to [allow] that. So we must all be treated the same here,” adds EFF leader.  We must intensify the defense of the revolution and its revolutionary leadership without fail. Fighters are here in support of the CIC @Julius_S_Malema. Victory is certain. #HandsOffCiC pic.twitter.com/DOqcGt7bly — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) October 13, 2020
