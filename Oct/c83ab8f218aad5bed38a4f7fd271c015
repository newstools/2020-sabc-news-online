The Carolina Magistrate Court in Mpumalanga has denied bail to three men facing charges that include kidnapping, assault, defeating the ends of justice and murder. The three – William Wimpie Viljoen, Hannes Terblanche,  working at a supermarket chain store and Obi  Nortjie from a private security company – allegedly kidnapped two men and assaulted them at the shop storeroom in July. One of the victims reportedly succumbed to head injuries in hospital, weeks later. The case has been postponed to 12 November for postmortem results. The lawyers of the three accused are intending to appeal the judgement. Pieter de Beer represents Viljoen and Terblanche. “The judgement has been made by the court. We need to abide by that. Obviously, (we) don’t agree with the judgement. Our avenue is now to go forward with the matter to appeal.”
