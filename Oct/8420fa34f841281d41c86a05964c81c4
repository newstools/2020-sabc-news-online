The Senekal Magistrate’s Court in the Free State has denied bail to 51-year-old Andre Pienaar who’s facing charges of attempted murder, malicious damage to property and public violence. The matter has been remanded until the 20th of next month for further investigations. Pienaar was arrested last week following violence in which a group of farmers stormed the court building to demand that two suspects charged with the murder of 21-year-old farm manager Brendin Horner be handed over to them. The violent protests followed the brief court appearance of Sekwetje Mahlamba and Sekola Matlaletsa who are accused of Horner’s murder. SABC’s Aphumelele Mdlalane reports:  Mixed reactions to violence There has been a range of mixed reactions to the violence which broke out in Senekal following Horner’s murder. Deputy CEO of Civil Rights Organisation AfriForum says although violence is regrettable and cannot be condoned, the community’s anger is understandable. Police have been criticised for what was deemed ‘their perceived lack of action’ to quell the protests. On the other hand, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) commended the police’s handling of the protests, after the crowd dispersed when police fired a warning shot. Roets further expressed concern over the possibility of escalating protests should government not urgently address the issue of farm attacks. The Senekal Safety Association says while violence cannot be condoned, government leaders should also refrain from chanting slogans that may incite racial hatred during protests:  Meanwhile, farmers in the Free State called for the return of the death penalty to deal with farm murders:  -Additional reporting by SABC News
