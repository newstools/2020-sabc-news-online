He said answering questions from the State Capture Commission from the 16th to the 20th of November will be an inconvenience.

Zuma’s lawyers have asked Zondo to recuse himself because of what they call the Chairperson’s “continued bias”. The JG Zuma Foundation argues that it is not fair for Zondo to expect Zuma to make an appearance, while he has not responded to the request for his recusal. Last month, Justice Zondo said if Zuma or his lawyers don’t appear on Friday, he will proceed with the application to compel him to appear before the Commission.
