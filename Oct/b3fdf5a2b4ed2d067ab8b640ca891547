A man has been killed and another injured following a cash-in-transit heist at Florida, west of Johannesburg. Emergency officials went to the Hendrik Potgieter and Ontdekkers intersection where they found an armoured vehicle, which had been blown open. A security guard had sustained minor injuries. ER24’s Russel Meiring says minutes later, paramedics were called to the scene of a shooting on 14th Avenue. “On scene, medics found a man lying inside a towing recovery vehicle. Assessments showed that he had sustained a fatal gunshot wound to his chest. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known, but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.”
