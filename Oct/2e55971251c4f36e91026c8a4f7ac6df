Anti-Gang Unit top cop, Lieutenant-Colonel Carl Kinnear, was laid to rest on Saturday in Cape Town. Kinnear was gunned down in front of his home at Bishop Lavis on the Cape Flats two weeks ago. He was involved in high profile investigative work related to the alleged criminal underworld. Police Minister, Bheki Cele, said Kinnear should not be mourned but rather celebrated as he was a hero. Cele says the only honour that must be bestowed upon Kinnear is to continue the work he did to protect South Africans, make sure the law is enforced and crime is investigated. Cele says ongoing attacks on the police in the Western Cape should not go unchallenged. He says the communities must also condemn the killings.  Former rugby player, Zane Kilian (39) was charged with the murder. Kilian appeared in the Bishop Lavis Magistrates’ in September after Kinnear was gunned down near his house. Kilian was arrested in Gauteng. The 52 year old was working for the Anti- Gang-Unit in Cape Town – investigating high-profile cases, such as the murder of prominent lawyer Pete Mihalik, underworld boss Nafiz Modack, and eight high-ranking police officers who are accused of colluding with fellow officers at the Central Firearm Registry.
