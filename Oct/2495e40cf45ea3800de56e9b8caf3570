The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the Northern Cape says it is ready for this weekend’s voter registration. The Electoral Commission is calling on voters to ensure that they update their details ahead of next month’s by-elections which will take place in eight municipalities. Two of the municipalities, Phokwane and Renosterberg, will be contested for proportional representatives, as their councils were dissolved due to political infighting. The IEC’s Bonolo Modise says, “Eight of the municipalities in the province will have by-elections on the eleventh of November. Preparations for those by-elections begin this weekend with the registration of voters in those wards. So it is our plea to voters to make use of this opportunity to visit their stations this weekend between 8 and 5 to make sure that their names are included on the voters’ roll.” “The municipality of Phokwane and Renosterberg will be electing new councils. The two councils were dissolved and in that way, the elections on the 11th of November will be to elect new representatives who will form new councils in the two municipalities,” adds Modise. Voter registration will be held on October 3 and 4 for the 96 municipal ward by-elections scheduled to take place on November 11. The by-elections, which will take place in 56 municipalities across the country, are expected to affect over 600 000 registered voters. The IEC says it is eager to fulfil its mandate and is holding the by-elections at the earliest possible and practical time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
