The Eastern Cape uMkhonto we-Sizwe Military Veteran Association (MKMVA) members have called on the ANC to stop MKMVA members wearing of military regalia. The association’s provincial secretary, Petros Vantyu says the wearing of the uniform is in contravention with the resolutions of their 54th conference. He added that some people use it to advance factional politics within the party. Vantyu says this compromises the dignity of uMkhonto we Sizwe. “It’s been misused many times. Sometimes we are misrepresented by people who are marching and not marching in a proper way in our funerals. It has been used by people who are demanding this and that from government, whereas there are processes that people should follow in engaging government structures and the Department of Military Veterans. In fact, it really misrepresents what MK stood for. It has been used for factional battles of the ANC by people with nefarious motives.” The national executive of the MKMVA disagrees with the Eastern Cape veterans. However, national MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus says members of the association have the right to political views and expressions as individual members of the ANC. “We believe wearing the uniform has the particular historical correctness and there is nothing wrong with it. No abuse for MKMVA members to express their concerns about employment, lack of housing. In fact, the statement of the comrades of Umkhonto we Sizwe in the Eastern Cape  also raised those issues, and there’s nothing wrong with the MKMVA members to register their concerns about developments at Prasa.”
