Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) treasurer-general Omphile Maotwe says farmers are trying to hijack the debate on land expropriation without compensation. He was referring to recent tensions in Senekal, in the Free State, where farmers protested the court appearance of two suspects accused of the murder of a farm manager. The two are applying for bail in the local Magistrate’s Court. Senekal murder accused back in court:  Farmers faced off with EFF supporters forcing the police to intervene. Tensions high in Senekal:  Maotwe says they won’t rest until land is returned to its owners. “At the centre of these is the issue of the land. We are still calling for expropriation of land without compensation because that is what makes these white people think that they are better than us. It makes them think they are superior to us. We have seen tweets saying that they used to rule here and they are going to claim this place again. Those are the things that are not surprising us because their actions have always shown us that they want to get back to where we were before.” Maotwe says their promise to voters in the build-up to the last general elections was for land to be given back to its rightful owners. Maotwe told the SABC earlier that white supremacy would never be allowed in South Africa.
