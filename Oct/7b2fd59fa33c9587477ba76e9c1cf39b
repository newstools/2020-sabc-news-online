The case against a Russian national arrested for allegedly being in possession of a consignment of weapons of war has been postponed to 10 March 2021.  The defence was not ready to carry on with the scheduled pre-trial. Fifty-one-year-old Katz Tal was arrested during a police raid at his Wierdabrug home in Centurion, south of Pretoria, in November last year. During the arrest of Tal police discovered an arms cache comprising of amongst others hand grenades and ammunition. Tal, who owned a gunshop, is facing a charge of contravening the Guns Act among others. He has been accused of keeping dangerous weapons in a residential property without the necessary licence. Dangerous weapons including rocket launchers, AK-47s, R1 rifles, pistols, revolvers, crossbow, and scores of ammunition boxes were confiscated during his arrest. Army uniforms and a dagga plantation were also discovered. He is out on bail of R10 000 until his next appearance in court in March next year.
