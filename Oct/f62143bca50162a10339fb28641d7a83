An increase in the rate of coronavirus infections in several areas of Mangaung in Bloemfontein in the Free State has left residents panicking. Gloomy weather, however, did not discourage those who lined up in queues in Heidedal demanding to be tested. The department declared four areas of Mangaung as hotspots. They are Heidedal, Bergman, Rocklands and Universitas as hotspots. These residents raised their concerns. “People don’t wear mask. Social distancing, they don’t adhere to it. There is a biggest problem. You can see people go to school, for instance they work in groups. They are attending group sessions without distancing between them.” “Social distancing is a problem there is no one walking around to say social distancing, sanitizer, we don’t see people walking to sanitize people.” #NewNormal
