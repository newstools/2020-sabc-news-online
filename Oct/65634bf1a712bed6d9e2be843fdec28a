The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg will on Tuesday continue to hear testimony from former independent consultant at Eskom, Nicholas Linnell. Former Eskom group executive Dan Marokane and former financial director Tsholofelo Molefe are also expected to testify. Linnell revealed that he was appointed by former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni to head up an investigation into challenges facing the power utility, which also included load shedding. On Monday, Linnell said he did not question Myeni’s involvement in matters relating to Eskom. He said he understood Myeni to have been acting in her capacity as former President Jacob Zuma’s confidant and political ally. Linnell refuted Myeni’s claim that the meeting held at Zuma’s then official residence in Durban was arranged to discuss challenges faced by Zola Tsotsi in his capacity as Eskom Board Chairperson. Linnell said Zuma gave the go-ahead for three top Eskom executives to be suspended and for a legal inquiry to be conducted. He said he did not see anything wrong with the former President’s intervention into operational matters at the power utility, as outlined in the videos below:
