Tanzania’s two leading opposition parties said on Saturday they will not recognise results of a presidential election that handed incumbent leader John Magufuli another term this week. “We demand that the election be called afresh right away,” Freeman Mbowe, chairman of the opposition CHADEMA party, said in a post on his Twitter account. Magufuli won the elections by more than 12.5 million votes. In his bid for a second term, he has promised voters that he will boost the economy by completing ambitious infrastructure projects he started in his first term. These include a new hydropower dam, a rail-line and planes for the national carrier. The government projects economic growth of 5.5% in 2020 after COVID-19 hit key sectors such as tourism. The World Bank predicts expansion of only 2.5%. Magufuli is promising voters that his infrastructure projects will fuel growth of at least 8%:  Zimbabwe has commended Tanzania for conducting successful elections, while the United Kingdom, has expressed concern following allegations of irregularities. – Additional Reporting SABC News
