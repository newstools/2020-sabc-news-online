People have lost jobs and there has been a big outcry of corruption. We have to assure people that we are addressing these issues not, not even during the elections. But as we speak now we have plans, we are addressing the problem of unemployment; we are addressing the problem of corruption. People want to see action. We can talk a lot put up posters, but unless people see that we are doing something. It will be very difficult elections, difficult to convince people but because we have plans I think we will be able once again to give people confidence.” @MyANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile interacts with residents of Gugulethu in Greytown, KwaZulu Natal. pic.twitter.com/c6iwCVw62j — African National Congress (@MYANC) October 15, 2020
