The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has referred over 5 500 Eskom employees for disciplinary action over a range of offences – including failure to declare their interests and doing business with the power utility. The SIU last week updated Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts on its investigations into alleged corruption in coal, diesel and build contracts involving billions of rands. SIU recommends disciplinary action against more than 5500 Eskom employees  The SIU says it has found that several Eskom employees did business with the power utility worth R6 billion and that four Eskom officials received kickbacks to the tune of R44 million. “It was allowed to happen because nobody seems to care about what was going on, but maybe some of the people might have been involved in this matter and that is why we have now referred that part for criminal prosecution because we think it is important that the criminal side be looked into so that those who were affected and those who were part of it and are not on the documents that we found can be found. For us, it is a very serious matter and they know it, that is why when some of them found out they decided to resign,” says Kaizer Kganyago, SIU Spokesperson. SIU aims to recover almost R9 billion from corrupt Eskom deals
