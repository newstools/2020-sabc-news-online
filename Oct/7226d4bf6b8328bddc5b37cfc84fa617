The Mayor of the Sedibeng Municipality south of Johannesburg, Busisiwe Modisakeng, has conveyed her condolences to the family of murdered municipal manager, Stanley Khanyile. The 52-year-old was gunned down in Alberton on Saturday in what is suspected to have been a hit. He was shot six times while sitting in his car in the parking lot of a shopping centre. No one has been arrested in connection with the killing. Khanyile was due to appear in court on 16 October on charges of money laundering, fraud and theft relating to a multi-million rand project in the Eastern Cape while he was the head of the provincial Social Development Department. He served as Sedibeng Municipal Manager from June 2017. Municipal Spokesperson, Saviour Kgaswane says the murder was brutal. “The brutal and inhumane murder of Mr Khanyile has left a devastating pain and sudden loss to the family of Sedibeng District Municipality and its stakeholders. I humbly urge that we provide the Khanyiles the much-needed space and support during this dark and trying time for their loss and grief and to ensure that Mr Khanyile receives a dignified send-off,” says Modisakeng. Police Spokesperson Mathapelo Peters has appealed to the public to help the police with information on the shooting. “The motive for the shooting is unclear at this stage. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or any information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspect or suspects is urged to contact the nearest police station or to contact the saps crime stop number 08600 10111. All the information will be treated confidentially,” says Peters. Meyersdal Square Alberton: victim shot and killed while sitting in his car. Several shots fired.
