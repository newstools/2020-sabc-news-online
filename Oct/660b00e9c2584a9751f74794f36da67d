The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) in the Northern Cape has called off its week long strike at the Sol Plaatje Municipality in Kimberley. The strike has seen administrative and municipal services grind to a halt in the city. The video below  is reporting on the Samwu strike in Kimberley:  The workers were demanding salary increments and that the municipality pay them a danger allowance for working during the national COVID-19 lockdown. Municipal mayor Patrick Mabilo and his council recently came under fire for giving themselves increments and denying regular municipal workers salary increases. Mabilo now says workers will go back to work on Thursday after reaching an agreement with Samwu. “The 6.25% increment will be implemented with immediate effect from the end of November 2020. Outstanding payment will be staggered between January 2021 to June 2021. Some employees were officially recalled by the employer during the lockdown. Such employees ought to receive a danger/risk allowance,” explains Mabilo. In July, Samwu members in Tshwane went on strike over salary increments.
