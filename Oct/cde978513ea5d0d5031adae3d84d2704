The African National Congress (ANC) says it hopes the party’s provincial Integrity Commission will complete its work before the end of the month. This after former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede appeared before the commission in Durban. Her appearance follows her arrest for fraud and corruption early last year. Gumede is one of 11 ANC members who have been told to subject themselves to the internal process as they face criminal charges. The former mayor and certain municipal officials as well as some party councillors are alleged to have manipulated a multi-million waste removal tender in favour of certain companies. ANC KZN spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela says, “We can confirm that comrade Zandile Gumede appeared in front of the Integrity Committee in KZN [and] comrade Mabuyakhulu appeared the previous week. The team will further engage with the other 10 or 11 members to come and present their cases. Hopefully, in a month they will be able to give us a report as the PEC to make findings and conclude these matters.” Gumede was recently deployed by the ANC as a member of the provincial legislature.
