Themba Sibiya, Bongani Ntanzi, Mthobisi Ncube, Mthokozisi Maphisa and Sifiso Ntuli are appearing at the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on the East Rand. They have been charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery with aggravated circumstances and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. All the accused have decided not to apply for bail. They say they have already been in prison in connection with other cases. They say they don’t understand why they’ve been arrested in connection with Meyiwa’s murder.

The case has been postponed to the 27th of November, and the Mewyiwa family thanked the public for their support: [HAPPENING NOW] The brother of the late #SenzoMeyiwa, Sifiso thanks supporters who gathered outside court to support his family.
