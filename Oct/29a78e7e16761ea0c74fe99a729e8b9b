The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State has come out guns blazing calling on law enforcement to act accordingly against people who burnt a police vehicle in Senekal. The van was torched during a commotion outside the Senekal Magistrate’s Court, where Sekwetje Mahlamba and Sekola Matlaletsa appeared briefly in connection with the murder of farm manager, Brandon Horner. Police say a group of farmers stormed the court building demanding suspects to be handed over to them:  The EFF says the act undermines police authority. EFF Free State Secretary, Bosanku Msimanga has called for those responsible to be brought to book. “We believe in the right to life. There’s no one whose life should be taken just like that. No one has a right to undermine our police service in that fashion that they did to an extent of burning a car, a police car and with no repercussions. There has to be repercussions for all those who were directly involved in that activity. So, we are calling on the MEC of Police, the commissioner, the minister to act accordingly. All those who were involved in this crime must be brought to book.” Farmers in the area say they do not feel safe following Horner’s death. Farmer Piet van der Merwe has called for the return of the death penalty. “I think the death penalty must be introduced. We can’t go on like this. [President Cyril] Ramaphosa is just as guilty for all these farm murders. Blood is on his hands and [Minister Bheki] Cele must fall. He is the biggest criminal. Law and order must be restored immediately. We must get protection.” Another farmer, Hardi Odendaal says they are disturbed by the latest killing. “Everybody is really feeling bad about the whole thing and it must stop. It’s the only thing. It must stop now. Not over a month but now, today, and stop all over the country the murdering of farmers.” EFF statement below:
