Former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vincent Smith and former Bosasa chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi are expected to appear at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Smith made his first appearance without Agrizzi over a week ago where he was granted R30 000 bail. The video below is reporting on Vincent Smith’s bail application:  Smith’s fraud and corruption charges relate to his relationship with Bosasa while he was chairperson of the Correctional Services Committee in Parliament. Agrizzi told the State Capture Commission that Smith had benefited financially to the tune of R800 000 from Bosasa. However, Smith had told the commission that the money was a loan from Agrizzi. The video below, is the live stream of Smith at the commission:  He told the court that he would plead not guilty to the charges. Aggrizzi could not appear alongside Smith because of ill-health.
