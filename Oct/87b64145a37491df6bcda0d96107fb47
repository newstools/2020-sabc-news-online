Pastor Timothy Omotoso is back in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday to apply for bail. He and his two co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zikiswa Sitho are facing more than 90 sex-related charges. Omotoso has been in jail for almost three years, while his co-accused are out on bail. The case has been a stop-start event from the beginning. The flamboyant Pastor is accused of luring young girls from his Jesus Dominion International Church to a house in KwaZulu-Natal, where they would have been spiritually trained, but instead were allegedly sexually abused. His legal team will also submit an application for the court to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for the protracted delays in the case. They will also request the court to dismiss the evidence of the two witnesses who have testified thus far. Chilling testimonies As his trial resumed earlier this year, state witness Andisiwe Dike outlined details of how she was sexually abused by the Pastor at his house in Durban. She described three events where she said she felt unsafe in the hands of what she saw as a ‘man of God’. Dike described her first one-on-one encounter with Omotoso as scary, shocking and disgusting. She detailed a number of events where she said she was shocked by the Pastor’s behaviour, with the worst being when Omotoso sent for her to be called to his bedroom one evening. She said she was told to lock the door, where she knelt before him as a sign of respect. She also alleged that Omotoso looked at her and patted the spot next to him in his bed. Dike alleges that they exchanged a short conversation before Omotoso pushed her to her back and climbed on top of her. She added that she was one of over 20 girls who were in his house and were not associated with their own names, but were called by animal names and the months that they were born in:  -Additional reporting by Anda Nqonji
