Switzerland announced tighter restrictions on Sunday to tackle the second wave of the coronavirus hitting the country, including a nation-wide obligation to wear masks and a ban on large scale public gatherings. Gatherings of more than 15-people in public places will be banned from Monday and masks must be worn in all indoor public places, the government announced following an extraordinary meeting. An order to wear masks on public transport has been extended to cover train stations, airports, bus and tram stops, the government said, replacing a patchwork of regulations which applied across Switzerland’s different regions. The obligation to wear a mask will also apply to shops, banks, churches, and cinemas, the government said.
