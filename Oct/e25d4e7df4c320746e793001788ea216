The United Nations food agency, the World Food Programme (WFP), won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas. The Rome-based organisation says it helps some 97 million people in about 88 countries each year and that one in nine people worldwide still do not have enough to eat.  The @WFP has been awarded the 2020 #NobelPeacePrize for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict. — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 9, 2020  “The need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever,” Chairperson Berit Reiss-Andersen of the Norwegian Nobel Committee told a news conference.  WFP is deeply humbled to receive the 2020 #NobelPeacePrize. This is in recognition of the work of WFP staff who put their lives on the line every day to bring food and assistance to more than 100 million hungry children, women and men across the world. pic.twitter.com/cjHOtqLcLk — World Food Programme (@WFP) October 9, 2020  The prize is worth ten million Swedish crowns, or around$1.1 million, and will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10.
