The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it is important that those accused of state capture should be held to account for their actions. The Investigating Directorate in the NPA was responding after former Bosasa Chief Operating Officer (COO) Angelo Agrizzi was denied bail by the Commercial Crimes court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrates’ Court, in Johannesburg yesterday. Agrizzi blew the whistle last year at the State Capture Commission on the alleged dodgy BOSASA dealings with politicians to get government tenders, mostly in the Correctional Services Department. Agrizzi has spent his first night in jail after being denied bail. In the video below, the court denies Agrizzi bail:  The Investigating Directorate’s spokesperson, Sindisiwe Twala says they’ve been working around the clock to bring the culprits in the state capture debacle to book. “What we can deduce from investigations between the investigative directive lead by advocate Herman and alongside various other law enforcement agents, we were able to see that there is some form of a plan to leave the country and evade any form of prosecution.” “So after he gave his evidence at the state capture commission, we got on top of this case to find out what exactly is happening behind the scenes. We were then able to uncover that he has over R35 million. We discovered [that the] money was siphoned out of the country. We are reclaiming the country from capture,” explains Twala.
