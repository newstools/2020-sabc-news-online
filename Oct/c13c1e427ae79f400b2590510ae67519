Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of frustrating efforts to investigate corruption of millions of rand related to the new legislature premises in Bloemfontein. The party says the Ramkraal Prison site was meant to be converted into a new Free State Legislature complex but nothing has happened at the national heritage site despite millions of rand spent on the project. DA Free State Member of the Provincial Legislature David Janse Van Vuuren says the people of the Free State need to know what happened to the money. “The problem there is the 120 million rand spent on this project, they demolished one of the buildings and it’s a heritage site, they didn’t follow all the processes to demolish or built this new complex.” “There’s nothing, there is no fence. If we talk about value for money what happened to the money.” However the ANC Chief Whip Vusi Tshabala has refuted claims that his party prevented the opposition from doing an oversight on the project “Whether the money is missing or not we must make sure we get reports from relevant appointed people, remember in terms of the constitution we have powers to request any report from anybody, any payments that were made it is the power enshrined in the constitution that we must get that information.” Opposition parties in the Free State have accused the African National Congress (ANC) of frustrating efforts to investigate alleged multimillion-rand corruption related to the new legislature premises in Bloemfontein. https://t.co/Ladh4XZ6aR — SABC News (@SABCNews) October 17, 2020
