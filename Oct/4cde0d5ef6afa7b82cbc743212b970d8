Eligible voters have another opportunity to update their details during this weekend’s voter registration period. Voter registration started yesterday for the 96 municipal ward by-elections scheduled to take place across South Africa on the 11th of next month. The voter registration weekend gives an opportunity to all eligible voters to register and for current voters to check their registration details and to provide or update address details where necessary. Eleven of the by-elections will be held in the Western Cape. Provincial IEC head Courtney Sampson says, “No issues reported to us. We opened 40 voting stations we used for registration points in the eleven wards that will be contested on 11 November. So people who live in those wards had opportunity to register to check or change details. Our staff were on time and people made use of the opportunity to do so.” Meanwhile, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) says no serious incidents were reported yesterday, on the first day of voter registration for next month’s by-elections. Deputy Chief Executive Officer at the IEC, Masego Shiburi, says the electoral body will only know how many potential voters turned out once the registration process has been concluded this afternoon. “All our processes started on time this morning (Saturday). We’ve had an equal stream of people coming to check their details and to register. The actual turn out we will only know once we’ve processed all the information of the new registrations as well as those persons who had come to inspect their details on the roll. We have not received any efforts of any disruptions and where there may have been, those would have been dealt with at a local level with other stakeholders.” The video below takes a look at the first day of the voter registration:
