Government has revised the list of high risk countries based on a risk categorization model. In a statement, the Department of Home Affairs says nothing has changed as far as all travellers from the African continent are concerned. It states that they are still welcome to visit the country subject to COVID-19 protocols. People from high risk countries who may visit South Africa fall into the following categories: business travellers, holders of critical skills visas, investors and people on an international mission in sports, arts, culture and science. International travel ban lifted for all African countries: Home Affairs Minister  The department further says,  “In addition, we recognise that there are a number of regular visitors from mainly European countries that have been accustomed to long periods of visitation to our country during our summer season when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Most of them own properties in the country. We appreciate the significant economic contribution that they make through their activities in the country. To this end, we will also allow visitors, in whichever category, who are coming to stay for a three months period or more subject to COVID-19 protocols.” Requirements for permission to enter South Africa People who need to apply must direct email requests to Covid19BusinessTravel@dha.gov.za, supported by: (a) a copy of passport and/or temporary residence visa;
