Afriforum says they believe there is a strong case against those arrested in the murder case of Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates captain, Senzo Meyiwa. Five suspects have been charged for the murder – six years after the soccer star’s killing in Vosloorus east of Johannesburg. The charges include murder, attempted murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and the illegal possession of a firearm. Some of the accused are serving prison sentences while others are awaiting trial for separate crimes. The case has been postponed to November 27. Advocate Gerrie Nel from AfriForum’s private prosecution unit says, “From the briefing, I do think there is a fairly strong case against the accused. The firearm was linked to the murder and one of the accused in the matter, so if that is so, there is absolutely strong evidence. But that is not the only issue here, which is if this was a hit or assassination, the mastermind is arrested and charged.” Advocate Gerrie Nel on developments in the Senzo Meyiwa case:  All five men who stand accused of the murder of former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates captain Senzo Meyiwa have denied any wrongdoing. Themba Sibiya, Bongani Ntanzi, Mthobisi Ncube, Mthokozisi Maphisa and Sifiso Ntuli appeared in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on the East Rand yesterday. All the accused have decided not to apply for bail. They say they have already been in prison in connection with other cases. They say they don’t understand why they’ve been arrested in connection with Meyiwa’s murder. In the video below, the suspects appear before court:
