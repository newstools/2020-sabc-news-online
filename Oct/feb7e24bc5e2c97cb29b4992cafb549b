African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, says he believes the party will always have a special place in the hearts of the voters across the country. He says next month’s by-elections will see the ANC emerge victorious. Magashule was speaking in Ekurhuleni where he conducted a door-to-door campaign, urging potential voters to give the governing ANC a chance to show that it has improved and is more than willing to listen to the needs of those who stay in under resourced areas. The ANC SG says it’s all systems go for the upcoming by-elections, with locals promising to vote for the ANC. “The branch executive is there, the people are here – all our structures, the youth league, the women’s league. Door-to-door, interaction with our people, back to basics. Not only during the elections, motive them and ensure that they are safe during covid-19, we still preaching that gospel. So we are here to simple do door-to-door and encourage our people,” says Magashule.
