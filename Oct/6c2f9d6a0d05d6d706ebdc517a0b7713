Motorists along the coastal regions of the country have been urged to exercise caution on the roads due to wet weather conditions expected over the weekend. Forecaster at the South African Weather Service, Lehlohonolo Thobela says heavy rainfall is expected that may cause structural damage to informal settlements and result in poor visibility while driving. “We are expecting widespread showers and thundershowers over the east coast and isolated and scattered showers over the most parts of the country. Also heavy rain is expected around the east coast covering Durban, so that will be from the east coast covering PE and Durban on Saturday. On Sunday we are expecting a chance of isolated showers.”
