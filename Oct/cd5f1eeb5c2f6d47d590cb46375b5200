The Pretoria High Court has ruled in favour of South African Revenue Services (SARS) to liquidate company, Zikhulise Cleaning Maintenance and Transport Service, belonging to the Durban businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize, who went back to her maiden name after her divorce from S’bu Mpisane. SARS told the court that the company owes the state R122 million in taxes, of which the company is disputing it’s R50 million. SARS had taken the matter to court after the company of the Durban businesswoman who own a huge mansion in the upmarket suburb of La Lucia had failed to pay tax. Zikhulise has been getting tenders to build low-cost RDP houses in a number of municipalities, including eThekwini and KwaDukuza, north of Durban. The company has also been getting tenders from the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government to build and renovate schools. Mkhize’s company was ordered to pay the legal costs for the litigation in the Pretoria High Court. Her attorney Jennifer Faber has confirmed that they intend to appeal the judgement. Faber says they have until the beginning of next month to file their papers in the appeal. “I confirm that I have received instructions from her to appeal the judgement that was handed by the Pretoria high court last week the judgement clearly stated that we were entitled to proceed to appeal which we are intending to do she’s been victimised at the moment in time and we are dealing with it as it comes and we have been fairly successful.” Women making waves in the male-dominated areas of business and soccer:
