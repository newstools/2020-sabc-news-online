US President Donald Trump’s physician said on Thursday that the President had completed his course of therapy for the coronavirus, had remained stable since returning to the White House, and could return to public engagements on Saturday. Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo released by the White House that Trump had responded “extremely well” to treatment. Meanwhile, President Trump said he does not believe he is contagious and is feeling good enough to resume campaign rallies as he tries to boost his flagging reelection bid. “I’m back because I’m a perfect physical specimen,” Trump told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in his first interview since it was revealed nearly a week ago that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump’s contention he was no longer contagious was not yet backed up by solid evidence from his doctors. The White House has refused to say when his last negative test for the virus was and, as a result, it is unclear how long he has been positive. The Republican president is under pressure to actively campaign again to try to inject new energy into his reelection bid as he faces a deficit in opinion polls in battleground states with Election Day now less than four weeks away. Trump rejected an announcement by the Commission on Presidential Debates that the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 15, would be held in a virtual format with the candidates in remote locations. The move was made to ensure it could go forward whether or not Trump remained virus-free. “I’m feeling good, really good,” said Trump, who spent three nights being treated at a military hospital outside Washington until his discharge on Monday. Trump said he had stopped taking “most therapeutics” for the virus but was still on steroids.
