The Senekal Magistrate’s Court has granted Sekola Matlaletsa R5000 bail. Matlaletsa is one of the two men accused of the murder of 21-year-old farm manager Brendin Horner. Sekwetje Mahlamba and Matlaletsa are accused of murdering Horner a few weeks ago in Senekal. Mahlamba will remain in police custody while Matlaletsa will have to report to a local police station on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Magistrate Deon van Rooyen has warned Matlaletsa not to violate his bail conditions. During their first court appearance, angry farmers in the province stormed the courtroom, demanding that the two suspects be handed over to them. The video below is reporting on farm killings:  During that violent clash, a police vehicle was set alight.
