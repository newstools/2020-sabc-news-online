The European Commission is in talks with four companies to secure a potential COVID-19 vaccine, President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday following an EU leaders’ video conference. The EU has already secured potential vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson. It has also said to be in talks with Moderna, CureVac and a partnership of Pfizer and BionTech. Meanwhile, EU leaders have also agreed to fairly distribute among EU countries a vaccine against the coronavirus, once such a vaccine becomes available, the chairman of the leaders said. “We very much agreed, it was repeated around the video conference table, to guarantee a fair distribution between member states in the case of contracts signed by the Commission and those we hope will be signed in the coming weeks,” Charles Michel told a news conference after an EU video-summit.
