Former Public Enterprise Minister Malusi Gigabaâ€™s chief of staff, Nhlanhla Msomi, asked former Eskom financial director Tsholofelo Molefe to assist the Guptas to do business with Eskom. Molefe, who is giving evidence at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg, says Msomi introduced her to Gupta associate Salim Essa and told her that Essa had concerns regarding getting tenders at Eskom.
