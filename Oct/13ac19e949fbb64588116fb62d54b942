The Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders says communities in the province are ready and prepared to resume with the initiation season this December. The traditional rite of passage to manhood was suspended during the coronavirus lock down. Speaking during a consultation session in Bhisho, acting chairperson of the house, Chief Langa Mavuso, says they have crafted a risk-adjusted strategy to prevent, mitigate and combat challenges associated with COVID-19 during the summer season. The traditional leaders say community and religious gatherings are now allowed under level one. “We have agreed to have training for traditional surgeons. We want to avoid illegal initiation because we have seen in winter when the country was in level 5 there were illegal initiations, especially in OR Tambo, so we don’t want such a situation. We don’t have many resources to control such.” Highlights of different Lockdown Levels below:
