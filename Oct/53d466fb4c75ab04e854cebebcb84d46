The second accused in the double murder case of the farming couple in Normadien outside Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal has now chosen to also abandon his bail application. Doctor Vukani Ngwenya who was arrested early this month appeared briefly with his co-accused Siyabonga Macu who was arrested just few weeks after Glen and Vida Rafferty were murdered at their farm in August this year. Macu and  Ngwenya appeared jointly for the first time in this matter at the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court. They are facing charges ranging from murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. The State said it is now waiting for a ballistic report and cellphone analysis evidence. The court also heard that a third suspect is likely to be arrested. Meanwhile, the defence also told the court that there is now conflict between Macu and Ngwenya and that they will no longer be represented by the same attorney. In a twist of events, Ngwenya also chose to abandon his bail application. The matter has been postponed to November 11 for Macu to find a new legal representative.
