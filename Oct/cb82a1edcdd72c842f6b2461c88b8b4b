Former Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku plans to challenge the findings of the SIU report which formed the basis of Premier David Makhura’s decision to fire him. In a statement, Masuku says he does not agree with the SIU finding that he failed to execute his oversight functions. Makhura announced that he was firing Masuku based on the preliminary findings of the Special Investigating Unit into alleged irregularities relating to the procurement of PPE supplies.

Dr Masuku plans to legally challenge the SIU findings:  Masuku denies involvement in COVID-19 PPE tender corruption Masuku has denied involvement in alleged COVID-19 personal protective equipment (PPEs) tender irregularities. He has refuted the allegations as unfounded saying the awarding of contracts within the department rests with the Supply Chain Management in the Finance department. In July, Masuku said, if evidence of corruption is found at his department action will be taken and offenders prosecuted. The MEC has also refuted any suggestion that COVID-19 procurement is being used as a means to raise funds ahead of African National Congress (ANC) conferences.
