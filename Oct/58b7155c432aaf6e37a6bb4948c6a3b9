An African National Congress (ANC) member in Limpopo has filed a contempt of court action against officials at the party headquarters, Luthuli House, after the party failed to implement a Johannesburg High Court order. The ANC reneged on appointing Ponani Makhubele as a permanent delegate to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) after the general elections. Makhubele was mysteriously removed from the ANC list. The order was granted in May 2019 after the ANC lost its application for leave to appeal against the deployment of Makhubele to the NCOP. Makhubele wants the ANC to secure her appointment as a permanent delegate to the NCOP within 15 days. She also wants the ANC to pay her more than R1 million within 30 days. According to the application, if the ANC fails to appoint her to the NCOP and also not pay the money, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule and Limpopo ANC Secretary Soviet Lekganyane, who are cited as respondents, should be sentenced to three months imprisonment. It is not clear yet if the ANC will oppose the application. The ANC has not yet commented.
