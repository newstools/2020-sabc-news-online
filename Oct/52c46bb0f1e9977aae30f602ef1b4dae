Ten police officers who are members of the Tactical Response Team, known as the “Amaberete” accused of business robbery will appear in the Kroonstad magistrates on Thursday for a bail application. The officers are facing charges of business robbery, defeating the ends of justice as well as perjury. Police officials based in Welkom allegedly confiscated a large amount of money from a business owner and his wife for allegedly contravening the Disaster Management Act by selling cigarettes during the lockdown period in June. The couple was later found not guilty and released. Police handed back the money to the couple but it emerged the cash handed back was not the same as the amount seized.
