KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Nomusa Dube Ncube, says she is currently in talks with national government following the Emirates‘ cancellation of flights to Durban. The first Emirates flight between Dubai and Durban following the relaxation of the COVID-19 regulations was expected to land at the King Shaka International Airport around midday tomorrow. Dube Ncube says Emirates has been a reliable partner since 2009 when it introduced its first direct flight between Dubai and Durban. The MEC is expected to welcome a Qatar flight which will land in Durban tomorrow afternoon. This will be KZN’s first international flight since March. “The MEC  is currently working with the national government around this matter and she is confident that this issue will be resolved. The MEC commits to work with Airport Company of South Africa, the airline industry and all other stakeholders guided by the national government in order ensure the implementation of all protocols aimed at fighting the spread of COVID-19 ,” says the Department’s spokesperson, Ndabezinhle Sibiya.
