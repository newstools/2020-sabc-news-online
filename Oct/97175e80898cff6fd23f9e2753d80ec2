A second wave of the coronavirus appears to be on the horizon for Nelson Mandela Bay as the number of infections rise steeply. Acting Mayor Tsonono Buyeye says 730 new cases were recorded this week. Motherwell has the most with 133 cases, KwaNobuhle has 46, KwaZakhele close behind it with 45 and Walmer currently has 39 active cases. Buyeye has pleaded with Metro residents to act responsibly. Chairperson of Nelson Mandela Bay Disaster Management Shane Brown says people are not complying with lockdown regulations. “We are putting out an appeal to residents as well as businesses to please take all necessary precautions and please wear face masks. Businesses, please ensure that you have compliance at the entrances to your businesses and shops. We must ensure we exercise all necessary safety precautions that are out there already. We have regulations and directories are legislated. It is a criminal offense for businesses to not comply.” During the week Health Minister Zweli Mkhize aired the same sentiments. He said the country’s epidemiological reports revealed a 9.1% increase in new cases over the last seven days. There has been an increase of 10.7% in the last 14 days. The Minister is concerned about a marked increase in the number of new cases in the Western Cape.
