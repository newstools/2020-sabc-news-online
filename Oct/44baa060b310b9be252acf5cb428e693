The National Taxi Alliance (NTA) has called on Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula to pay out the money set aside to provide relief for the minibus taxi industry, within ten days. Government pledged to set aside more than R1 billion for taxi owners to help mitigate the impact COVID-19 has had on the industry. The NTA says after failing to convince government to increase the amount, it asked that the money be paid directly to taxi operators rather than taxi bodies. It says instead government came up with impossible requirements. NTA President Francis Masitsa says they are prepared to go to court to force government to payout. “The legal letters submitted by our legal team to the minster and the Department of Transport have a ten-day period within which the minister has to comply. If nothing comes that is beneficial to the taxi industry you can be rest assured we are going out into the streets to take action.” Mbalula briefs the media on government’s relief for the taxi industry:  SANTACO rejects the government relief package for the taxi industry:
