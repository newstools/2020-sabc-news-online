We regard those allegations as an attack against the state; hence the charges should add terrorism.” Farmers in the Free State are calling for the return of the death penalty following the murder of Horner:  ‘Unite against crime’ In his weekly letter to the nation, President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on South Africans to unite in their fight against crime. He cited protests and vigilantism in Senekal as well as the shooting of three young men in a car in Delft in the Western Cape in the same week. He said citizens should not be blinded by their own prejudices to the suffering and pain of others, adding that it doesn’t matter whether the victim is black or white. Ministers Bheki Cele for Police and Ayanda Dlodlo for State Security are expected to visit the family of the slain farm manager, Brendin Horner in Paul Roux in the Free State on Tuesday. The ministers will also meet with various organised farming structures in an attempt to quell tensions in the area.
