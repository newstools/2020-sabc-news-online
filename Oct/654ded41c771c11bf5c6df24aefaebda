Senior officials from the Gauteng Community Safety Department will on Saturday visit the families of the victims of gender-based violence in Alexandra north of Johannesburg. The visit, which will include senior police officials, forms part of the department’s safety outreach programme aimed at supporting the victims’ families and to update them on the status of the criminal cases against the perpetrators. Families to be visited include those of a woman who was strangled to death by her husband last year and two young girls who were raped allegedly by their father in 2017. Gender-based violence is a profound and widespread problem in South Africa. The department’s spokesperson Ofentse Morwane says they will maintain their mandate. “What is critical is that as part of our mandate to monitor police efficiency in dealing with violent incidents. The department together with the police will be visiting families and victims to update them about their cases.” The video below is on shelters for victims of gender-based violence needing more funding:
