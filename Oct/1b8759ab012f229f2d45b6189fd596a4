The strike by  Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu ) affiliated union members has disrupted schooling in and around Pretoria. Teachers didn’t turn up to work, while at some schools, learners were released early. This was to allow South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) members to join the nationwide Cosatu strike and protest march in the Pretoria CBD. “No, we didn’t receive a full learning program today. The teachers were on strike and not all learners were at school today. There were a few of us so we haven’t studied enough.  We don’t know what are we going to write. We don’t know anything right now,” says one affected learner. “Actually, we did some school work though other learners were not present. We did push some of the work with other teachers,” adds another learner. No disruptions to businesses Meanwhile, businesses in and around Pretoria operated without any disruptions as Cosatu and Saftu embarked on a nationwide strike. There were fears of a shutdown as a result of the strike, which was organised over issues including unemployment and corruption. Workers who participated in the strike in Pretoria handed over a memorandum of demands to the Labour and Employment Department.
