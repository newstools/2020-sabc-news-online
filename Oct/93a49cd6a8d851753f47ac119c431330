The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused the African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament of protecting President Cyril Ramaphosa from accountability regarding the governing party’s recent so-called “lift” on an air force plane to Zimbabwe.

He said the Minister will not receive her salary for three months, starting from November 1, 2020. The ANC said it will pay for the delegates’ expenses.
