The City of Cape Town’s Health Department says it is seeking legal protection to prevent land invaders from occupying a tract of land meant for a new clinic in Khayelitsha. Mayoral Committee Member for Health, Zahid Badroodien, says the need for a new clinic to replace the existing Zakhele Clinic in Lingelethu West was identified in 2009. He says unlawful land occupations have been rampant recently. ” While no one can dispute the need for more housing opportunities, the behaviour of those unlawfully occupying land meant for services and terrorising anyone who they consider to be standing in their way, cannot be condoned. Their actions have far reaching consequences that do not always receive the focus it deserves, like the fact that improved health services for hundreds of thousands of residents are hanging by a thread.” In the video below,  City of Cape Town’s Anti Land Invasion Unit receives criticism:
