President Cyril Ramaphosa says Lesotho is on the path to stability after a government of national unity came into office last month. He was speaking at the end of his meeting with Lesotho Prime Minister Dr Moeketsi Majoro in Pretoria on Friday afternoon. It was the first meeting between the two since Majoro was sworn in as prime minister on May 20. The two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, regional and continental issues. Political instability has rocked Lesotho for some time. However, Ramaphosa says he is happy that peace and stability have returned to the country. Dr Majoro was accompanied by senior government officials from his country, including his deputy Mathibeli Mokhothu. Mokhothu is an opposition leader and is part of Lesotho’s government of national unity. Dr Majoro says Basotho have welcomed the new government with open arms and urged them to stop fighting following years of political instability in the Mountain Kingdom. In the video below, Dr Majoro says his government’s priority is to ensure that basic services are delivered to the Basotho.  The economist and politician was Lesotho’s Finance Minister before taking over the reins from embattled veteran politician, Tom Thabane, who resigned three months after he was named as a suspect in his estranged wife’s murder. Thabane and his current wife are suspects in the 2017 assassination case. Thabane did attend Majoro’s swearing-in ceremony, but his wife, Maesaiah was absent.
