The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture will hear testimony from former Prasa Board chairperson Popo Molefe and Prasa Legal Risk and Compliance Group Executive Martha Ngoye, on Monday morning. The hearings were halted in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. In March – Martha Ngoye explained to the Zondo Commission how PRASA went to great lengths to ensure a Siyagena – a company linked to businessman Roy Moodley- secured a contract worth billions of rands. Ngoye explained the irregularities and the forging of the signature of an executive, Tara Ngubane, when phase one of the contract was drafted. In 2015, the Public Protector found Prasa’s payments to Siyagena constituted maladministration and misconduct. Ngoye said former Prasa Chief Executive Officer, Lucky Montana had played a pivotal role in the awarding of the contract. Spokesperson for the commission, Mbuyiselo Stemela says strict COVID-19 protocols will be adhered to… “The witnesses that will testify will be Mr Popo Molefe, former chairperson of board of PRASA, Ms Martha Ngoyi head of legal department at PRASA and other witnesses that will be lined up for the week. In adherence to measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, strict social distance protocols, screening and every protocol that the commission will put in place will be adhered to at the hearing venue. There will be limited number of media allowed at the hearing venue and members of the public will not be allowed.” In the video below, State Capture Inquiry to resume on Monday:
