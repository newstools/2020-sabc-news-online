The National Council of Provinces has approved the recommendation that Pretoria Chief Magistrate Desmond Nair be provisionally suspended. The State Capture Commission had heard allegations that Nair benefited from security upgrades at his home that were paid for by the politically connected and now-defunct company, Bosasa. The Select Committee on Justice brought the recommendation to the NCOP. The provisional suspension has also been approved by the National Assembly. The Magistrates Commission had asked Justice Minister Ronald Lamola to suspend Nair while his fitness to hold office was investigated. Select Committee on Security and Justice Chair Shahidabibi Shaikh says, “On the 24th of February the Minster advised the commission to provisionally suspend Mr Nair with immediate effect, pending the finalisation of an inquiry of his fitness to hold office. And in terms of the Act has submitted a report for consideration at Parliament. Honourable chair having considered the report of the 25th of February 2020 by the Minster of Justice and Correctional Services on the provision of suspension of Mr D Nair pending the outcome of an investigation into his fitness to hold office as a Magistrate, the committee recommends that the National Council of Provinces confirms Mr D Nair’s provisional suspension from office of the Magistrate.” Nair is accused of receiving R200 000 worth of security upgrades at his house. This was revealed at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry. In the video below, Magistrates’ Commission’s Cassim Moosa discusses the matter with Tsepiso Makwetla:
