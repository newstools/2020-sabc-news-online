The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (BEMAWU) has reacted with concern to reports that the SABC has confirmed six recent cases of COVID-19. These were found at the corporation’s offices in Auckland Park, Seapoint and Port Elizabeth. BEMAWU President Hannes du Buisson says it’s worrying that one of the positive cases was responsible for the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE). “We are obviously concerned about the high incidents of COVID-19 that have been reported at the SABC. We understand that the SABC is an essential service and it is, therefore, a high risk service that is currently being legislated to be able to operate.” “We believe that the SABC is busy bringing unnecessary people to the workplace for disciplinary enquiries. We received information that a manager tested positive. This manager was responsible for packing PPEs. The COO has launched an investigation,” added Du Buisson. Precautionary measures The SABC said the latest cases were found in the last five days. According to the public broadcaster, there have been four previous cases. Acting SABC spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo says precautionary measures have been put into place. “The SABC can confirm 6 cases of COVID-19, at our Sea Point, Port Elizabeth and Auckland Park offices. As a precautionary measure, all SABC protocols as per the Department of Health directives have been implemented including employees occupying the offices being advised to self-isolate. Management has put in place business continuity measures and employees will continue to discharge their responsibilities remotely whilst in isolation.” In the video below, the SABC confirms news of the latest cases:
