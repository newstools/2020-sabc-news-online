A 20-year-old man has been detained following the death of a 17-year-old girl in Philippi on the Cape Flats. Amahle Quku’s naked body was found in a street in Browns Farm on Saturday. She had apparently been raped. The incident is the latest in a spate of attacks by men on women and children in South Africa. Police spokesperson Andre Traut says the suspect has been charged. “Our investigation into the murder of a 17-year-old girl whose body was found naked yesterday (Saturday) morning at around seven led to the arrest of a man into his 20s. The suspect is currently being questioned and once he has been charged he’s due to make a court appearance.” In Port Elizabeth, a woman has been killed and another victim was robbed in two separate incidents in Missionvale, in the Eastern Cape. Police say 32-year-old Chantelle Oliphant was robbed of liquor and shot dead in Okavango Street. Minutes later, another victim narrowly escaped injury when he was threatened at gun point by the same suspect, who fled the scene. Police found stolen goods on the scene. Cases of murder, attempted murder and attempted armed robbery have been opened. Police are appealing to the community for assistance in identifying the suspect.
