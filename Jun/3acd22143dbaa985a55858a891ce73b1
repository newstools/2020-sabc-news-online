Live stream:  The launch comes amid international uproar and protests over the death of a black American man George Floyd in police custody after being severely assaulted by a white police officer in a video that went viral on social media. However, the ruling party has received a backslash for its perceived silence following the death of Collins Khosa, a man from Alexandra township. Collins died after being brutally assaulted by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members in his yard.
