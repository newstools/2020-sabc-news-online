Democratic Alliance (DA) Federal Council Chairperson Helen Zille finds herself in hot water once again over a tweet in which she says that there are more racist laws today than there were under apartheid.   Two members of the party, member of parliament (MP) Hlanganani Gumbi and DA Gauteng Provincial Legislature member Khume Ramulifho have since taken the matter up with party leader John Steenhuizen asking that Zille’s tweets be investigated by the Federal Legal Commission. Ramulifho says he believes that the tweet is in contravention of the party’s constitution. “Making comparison of apartheid with the new democratic government I think is demeaning and distasteful and I think needs to be condemned. We have an obligation to build social cohesion knowing what is our history as a country and where we come from. We cannot rewrite history. We know that many individuals lost their lives, many individuals lost their families while they were fighting for freedom and this is the freedom that we are enjoying today.  We have an obligation as members of the DA that we build social cohesion, build one South Africa that all of us belong to.” In the video below  DA Gauteng provincial legislature member Khume Ramulifho discusses the complaints:
