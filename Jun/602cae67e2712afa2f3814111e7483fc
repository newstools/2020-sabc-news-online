Gauteng Finance MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko says the provinces’ municipalities have lost R5 billion in revenue due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Many residents have not been able to pay rates and taxes as companies had to shut down following the implementation of the national lockdown. This resulted in many people losing their jobs or suffering salary cuts. Nkomo-Ralehoko says the Gauteng government and its various departments have now paid municipalities a total of R2 billion for the 2019/2020 financial year in unpaid rates and taxes. She’s urged residents and businesses to also pay to prevent municipalities from collapsing. It is a difficult task because everyone does not have money. Even those who have the money, they were not paying their municipality rates. We are pleading with those that can pay to at least assist municipalities and pay that little amount of money that they have,” adds Nkomo-Ralehoko.
