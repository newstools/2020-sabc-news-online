Mining companies across the country continue to experience an escalation in the number of coronavirus infections. According to the Minerals Council South Africa, the mining sector has recorded 1 796 positive cases and six COVID-19 related deaths. Over 930 of the infections are in the North West, of which 450 of them are at the Impala Platinum Mine in Rustenburg. Impala Spokesperson Johann Theron, explaining the situation at the mine, says: “I can confirm that Impala Rustenburg Mine to date has recorded 455 positive COVID cases of which 63 have recovered meaning that we’ve got currently 390 active cases. In addition to that, we’ve got 776 people presently in isolation.” The mine says stringent measures have been put in place to curb the spread of the infections. “The strategy that we have employed with isolation is for all people returning to work from outside areas to first test them where we can, but equally to put them in isolation for a 14-day period to ensure that before they return to work we minimise the risk of any transmission to our workforce. The number of people that we are picking up are not necessarily people being infected at the mines, but rather an indication of the general prevalence of COVID among the community.” Below is a national overview of the number of infections in the country:  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 7090 1069 798 855 337 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 26 June 2020 371 DEATHS 9 1692 149 106 5 CONFIRMED CASES |124 590 DEATHS |﻿2340 TESTS CONDUCTED | 1 493 104 RECOVERIES | 64 111 ACTIVE CASES | 64 111 57 941 31 344 21 938 2 5 1 3218 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Global coronavirus update:  <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
