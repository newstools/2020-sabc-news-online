The Eastern Cape Health Department has defended its decision to launch mobile clinics and scooters. This after it received a backlash on social media where people are questioning the appropriateness of these bikes to transport patients.     The department says they are off-road bikes â€“ not part of its emergency fleet and will not ferry critical or emergency cases to hospitals. It says that they will be utilised for health education and awareness campaigns in communities during outreach programmes. This project was already in the pipeline before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The department employed 150 additional staff to operate the bikes as part of its primary health care outreach programme.

The contract was awarded through an open tender process. The department says its emergency services will continue operating with specialised vehicles, helicopters and Patient Transport Vehicles operated by qualified paramedics and ambulance practitioners. The department says it regrets the lack of clarity on the intended utilisation of the specialised bikes.
