Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane has called for society to work together to fight against gender-based violence (GBV). This follows a recent string of gender-based violence incidents. Demonstrations against GBV are continuing across the country on Tuesday – with people in Pretoria calling for justice over the death of Evelyn de Kock. The 42-year-old mother of two was found by relatives this week, stabbed multiple times at her home. Gauteng police have arrested a 50-year-old suspect in connection with the murder. Nkoana-Mashabane has joined protestors against GBV, saying enough is enough. “We are all saying enough is enough. We need to work with each other to make sure that we eradicate this demon so we are able to raise children in a safe neighbourhood. We have come here to say to the family, may Evelyn and all the other young women who died in the hands of their loved one, may their soul rest in peace,” says Nkoana-Mashabane.

In the latest incident, 28-year-old Ntwanano Shisana was allegedly shot and killed by her 27-year-old boyfriend who then shot and killed himself. The Limpopo Social Development Department has appealed to residents to make use of their counselling services when faced with challenges. Shisana was last seen alive when she and her boyfriend, Wisani Mathonsi, left his home in his car on Saturday evening. A few minutes later, their bullet-ridden bodies were found inside the car on the side of the main road at Bungeni village. It is alleged that Mathonsi shot her and later shot himself. Both died at the scene.
