More than 170 of Guinea-Bissau’s 2 000 health workers have contracted COVID-19, a World Health Organisation expert said on Tuesday, warning that hospitals were close to being overwhelmed. The tiny West African nation’s under-equipped healthcare system has been struggling to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected over 1 400 people and killed 15. Health authorities have raised the alarm over a lack of oxygen to treat patients. “The three main Bissau hospitals are currently facing rooms filled with COVID-19 patients and a breakdown in essential medical services,” said Joana Cortez, a WHO expert in Guinea-Bissau, during an online seminar on the impact of the epidemic on Portuguese-speaking African countries. Cortez said 176 health workers in the country had tested positive for the coronavirus. That amounts to nearly 9% of the country’s total medical staff of about 2 000, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from the health authorities. “It is a chaotic situation,” Cortez said. Health workers are vulnerable because of a lack of high- quality protective gear, according to Tumane Balde, who heads an interministerial COVID-19 commission.
