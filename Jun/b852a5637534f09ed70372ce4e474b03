Five people have been killed and several others have been injured after a sugar cane truck collided with two buses and several cars in the town centre of Jozini in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu-Mali says emergency services are still on the scene where people are trapped in the wreckage. “Five people sustain fatal injuries when the driver of the combination truck lost control due to brake failure and collided with five cars near Jozini clinic. There are multiple injuries on the scene and they were all rushed to Jozini clinic. We will update more further as we get more details of the accident.” Meanwhile, Western Cape traffic authorities have warned motorists to exercise caution amid cold and wet weather conditions. The Weather Service has issued a weather warning for the region with snow, strong winds and heavy rain. A number of informal settlements have already been flooded in the Cape Metropole following heavy overnight rain. The prevailing weather conditions are expected to continue into Thursday. Provincial Traffic Chief, Kenny Africa, says strong winds especially along mountain passes pose further danger. “Motorists please keep a safe following distance between yourself and other vehicles. Do not take unnecessary chances where it’s not safe to do so. We already had a few accidents. Two trucks overturned. One at the bridge at the Theewaterskloof dam and another one overturned on the N-2 just before Orchard where you get off to Grabouw.”
