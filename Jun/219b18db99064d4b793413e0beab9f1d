The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries has issued guidelines to be followed by fishermen in KwaZulu-Natal with the sardine season in full swing. Thirty individual and commercial right holders as well as 45 small-scale fishing cooperatives have been granted permits to catch sardines. Department spokesperson Albi Modise says the guidelines are geared to ensure adherence to COVID-19 regulations, while allowing fishermen to earn a living. “One of the measures is risk assessment. It is important that right holders regularly conduct risk assessment to update their operational procedures, also preventative measures by ensuring that there is temperature screening. Sanitizing of hands should also be part of the protocol for all crews before they enter the vessel and any crew member with temperatures above the 38 degrees or more should not be allowed in the vessel. In as far as personal protective clothing is concerned; right holders should provide all crew members with masks and sanitizers during the fishing operation.” Public banned from sardine run Meanwhile, members of the public have been banned from participating in the expected sardine run as COVID-19 regulations still prohibit people from swimming. The Department of Environmental Affairs also warned that the shark safety gear has been lifted in preparation for the shoal. Department spokesperson Ndabezinhle Sibiya has requested fishermen to ensure that they have a valid permit at all times.
