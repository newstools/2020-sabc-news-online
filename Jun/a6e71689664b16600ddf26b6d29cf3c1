A new app “Keep out COVID” created by online technology, Howler, will allow individuals to screen themselves for coronavirus ( COVID-19) through their phones using the app. The app hopes to lessen the burden of the healthcare system by allowing individuals to screen themselves from the comfort of their homes. Howle Director, Steve Cuzen, says, “Seeing the pandemic that has hit the world, we saw an opportunity to adapt our technology solutions to help people that were going back to work and schools. It also allows organisations to take control of the COVID-19 situation and prevent the COVID-19 from arriving at their organisations.” Cuzen sought to ensure people about the safety of the app, which he says is 100% safe. “No one has access to anything other than the organisation itself. All the information that we collect get to be stored to our servers that are encrypted. There is no way that people can hack them.” In the video below, Cuzen explains further about the app:  Infographic: Latest COVID-19 statistics in South Africa:   Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 3874 10027 495 326 1097 297 156 UNALLOCATED 63 AS AT 14 June 2020 227 4 1 1 DEATHS 9 1083 81 69 5 CONFIRMED CASES | 70 038 DEATHS | 1 480 TESTS CONDUCTED | 1 121 958 RECOVERIES | 38 531 ACTIVE CASES | 30 027 42539 11164 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
