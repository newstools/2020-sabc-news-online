Ramaphosa is in the province to assess its response in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. Ramaphosa says all skilled medical workers must immediately be sourced and employed to make up for staff shortages at medical facilities. “Not having enough staff members is not going to be an excuse that I will accept. We’ve got to find them. Money is not going to be the issue we must pull out all stops to save lives. This is a war that we must win. We cannot sit back and be defeated by COVID-19 on the basis that we didn’t have enough staff members. ” In the video below, President Ramaphosa addresses lack of medical staff in Western Cape:
