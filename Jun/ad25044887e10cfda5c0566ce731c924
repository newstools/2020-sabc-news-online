The City of Cape Town says all its driving and license testing stations due for reopening are operational. Traffic Spokesperson, Maxine Bezuidenhout, says other centres are expected to open from next week on dates still to be announced. Bezuidenhout says there will be no new bookings allowed as they are still trying to clear the pre-lockdown backlogs. “The confirmed list of centres that will be operational is as follows: Tlantis, Bellville, Brackenfell, Fishoek, Gallows Hill, Gordon’s Bay, Joe Qqabi, Kuilsriver Milnerton, Ottery and Parow. All others are slated for reopening on 15 June 2020, but confirmation of dates will be communicated in the coming days. Only certain services will be available initially. No new bookings will be accepted until further notice.” The Western Cape last week reopened schools ahead of other provinces after the Department of Education postponed the reopening to this Monday.
