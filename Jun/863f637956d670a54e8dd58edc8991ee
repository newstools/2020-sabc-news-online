Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged people not to attend planned #BlackLivesMatter protests around the country this weekend, citing the risk of spreading the coronavirus.  “The health advice is very clear, it’s not a good idea to go,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “Let’s find a better way and another way to express these sentiments … let’s exercise our liberties responsibly.”  Australia has reported daily single digit and low double digit numbers of new COVID-19 cases in recent weeks and has 490 active cases, with just 25 people in hospital.
