Academics, writers and artists in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, are demanding that the local municipality remove a statue of Cecil John Rhodes. Rhodes was one of the founders of the De Beers mining company in the city and an advocate of British imperialism. The statue has been standing in the Kimberley city centre for more than 100 years.  On Friday, protesters gathered at its foot to protest Rhodes’ legacy which, they say, is shameful and should not be commemorated. “He represents everything that we do not want. This statue is a symbol. It is a symbol of violence, it is a symbol of extreme violence and we don’t want to be walking past here and be reminded of this violence,”  said one protester. “The statue represents a sad part of history, we don’t want it here because we are offended by the colonial and apartheid iconography in our city,” added another one. “It is a slap on our history, it is a slap on our heritage, it’s a slap on our dignity as Africans because we are continuing to suffer this white supremacist values that are legitimised through the statue of Cecil John Rhodes so we cannot have him staying in Kimberley,” explains the convenor of the protest, Thina Nzo. The local Sol Plaatje Municipality says it will consider the anti-Rhodes protesters’ request.
