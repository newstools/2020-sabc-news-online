Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has again appealed to people to continue to practice COVID-19 safety measures, which include social distancing, washing of hands and wearing of masks in trying to reduce the spread of the virus. His comments come as the country has nearly 2 000 deaths, after another 53 people died in the past 24 hours, bringing the national death toll to 1 930. The infection rate is nearing the 100 000 mark with 97 302 confirmed cases. Mkhize says if people don’t change their behaviour and adhere to preventative measures, the number of COVID-19 cases are going to skyrocket. He says: “Currently, we are talking about 97 000, but in a few weeks we will be talking about several hundred thousand and that is because of this behaviour.” “Wait for two weeks you will see the impact of the recklessness, how it will actually translate in the numbers of more new infections. The real risk is when those numbers are so huge that even our hospitals can’t cope. We have managed it so well up to now, we need to really maintain the balance as we move into the next few weeks.”  The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa have increased by 4 621 to 97 302.
