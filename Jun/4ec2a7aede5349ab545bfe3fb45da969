Reopening of schools challenged Meanwhile, the High Court earlier ruled against the Educators Union of South Africa’s application opposing the reopening of schools. The union wanted the court to set aside a decision to reopen schools by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. The union argues that the threat posed by COVID-19 is significant and returning to school poses a greater threat to learners and educators. EUSA says it will await the written judgment before decides on their next course of action. Last week, the Constitutional Court dismissed the One South Africa Movement’s application to block the reopening of schools. The court said the application did not meet the requirements for the court to hear the matter. Leader of the movement Mmusi Maimane says they may approach the High Court.
