Over 160 stranded Nigerian nationals in South Africa have been successfully returned to their homeland. The operation saw 45 Nigerian nationals landing in Abuja and 122 others in Lagos. The evacuation process had been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic. In May, the Nigerian government announced the temporary suspension of the evacuation process to allow for a new policy before announcing its resumption earlier this month. Under the new protocol, a minimum of 1 000 Nigerians will be evacuated globally per week. Earlier this month, around 4 000 Nigerian nationals were stranded in different parts of the world, a backlog the countryâ€™s government is set to clear in four weeks. The evacuated nationals will have to sign an undertaking to ensure that they abide by the guidelines and safety precautions in Nigeria and undergo coronavirus tests. The Consulate General has meanwhile urged Nigerian nationals in South Africa to adhere to all the safety precautions set by the government.
