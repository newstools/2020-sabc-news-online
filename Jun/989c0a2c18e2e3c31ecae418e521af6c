Residents of Sutherland in the Northern Cape woke up to a blanket of snow on Thursday morning. This as the cold front moved over the area on Wednesday.  South African Weather Service forecaster Edward Engelbrecht says the snow is expected to fall throughout the day. He says although no snow has been predicted for Friday, the snow that has already fallen will likely remain for the next two or three days. “As a result of the cold front that has moved over from yesterday we have seen snow starting to fall from last night over the Sutherland area and that’s gonna continue for the rest of today, on and off snow showers. So we expect about 10 to 20 centimeters of snow to fall there for today and that should only start clearing from tonight, midnight overnight into tomorrow morning. And then we’re not expecting any more snow from tomorrow or for the rest of the week.”
