Dis-Chem Pharmacies has denied reports by the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers (NUPSAW ) that it is deliberately refusing to comply with COVID-19 safety standards at one of its warehouses in Johannesburg. Members affiliated to NUPSAW will on Monday picket outside the Dis-Chem warehouse in Midrand. The union says the company refused to identify and isolate high-risk contact persons at the warehouse. NUPSAW says there are 10 COVID-19 cases that have been detected at the warehouse and that staff has to pay for their own testing. The unions want the warehouse closed down to be sanitised. Dis-Chem National Clinic Manager Lizeth Kruger responds to the accusations after the pharmacy is accused of breaking lockdown regulations:  Caryn Eliasov-Barker, Human Resources Director at Dis-Chem, says all protocols are in place as laid by the health and labour departments. “The Dis-Chem Group is aware of some very strong allegations by the unions and we would like to dispute these. We would like to confirm that all protocols are in place as laid out by the Department of Health, the Department of Labour. We have adhered to all requirements during the lockdown period across the entire company.” The group has also denied an allegation that it has refused to test affected employees. Eliasov-Barker says they are willing to discuss any issues with affected employees. She says there are also employees who have no symptoms who are insisting on being tested. “We have put protocols and temperatures are tested every morning on their (employees’) arrival to work and they are also questioned on any symptoms that they may display. If any employee is unwell, they are immediately sent to our in-house Clinic Department where they are further assessed and a swab test is done by one of our nurses. These tests are not charged for and we bare all the costs including related admin processes.”
