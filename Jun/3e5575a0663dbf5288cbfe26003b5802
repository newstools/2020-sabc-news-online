Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) is continuing its clean-up of officials who have been found guilty of procurement irregularities after they dismissed four officials from its Protection Services Department. These dismissals are the culmination of a disciplinary inquiry, following allegations of impropriety in the awarding of security-related tenders. These dismissals started when the agency’s Administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo took office in December last year. Among Mr Mpondo’s priorities, as determined by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, is consequence management. Minister Mbalula characterised Prasa as a broken business, following years of maladministration and other malfeasance, especially in Supply Chain Management and the Protection Services departments. The wrongdoing was also highlighted in the “DERAILED” report by the Office of the Public Protector a few years ago. In a statement from Prasa says, “Prasa will continue to address the problem of irregular procurement through capacitation of employees for better understanding of the processes as well as through consequence management, as today’s action demonstrates.”
