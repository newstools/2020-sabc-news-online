The deadline for the Department of Public Enterprises to oppose the provisional liquidation of SA Express expires on Tuesday as the High Court in Johannesburg is expected to rule on the future of the state-owned airline. On Monday, hundreds of the airliners’ employees picketed outside the department’s offices in Pretoria. They were demanding answers about the non-payment of their salaries and are calling for government to delay the liquidation of the airline. The Public Enterprises Department earlier said it could not afford a further cash injection for SA Express as it had not received any business plan. In the video below, Pilot Lebohang Matlala who was part of the picket outlines his grievances:  Liquidation likely to go ahead The final liquidation of the airline is likely to go ahead as government has failed to oppose and give reasons as to why this should not happen. The airline was placed under provisional liquidation in April this year after a failed business rescue attempt. If liquidated, employees will not be able to protect their provident and pension funds and other retrenchment packages as all assets will be sold to pay creditors. The airline employs close to 700 employees who have not been paid since March.
