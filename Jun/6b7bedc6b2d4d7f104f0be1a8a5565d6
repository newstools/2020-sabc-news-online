The African National Congress (ANC) has called on South African men and boys to take a stand against the scourge of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in the country as femicide and child murder cases continue to rise. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says the abuse of women and children in the country is totally unacceptable. “The abuse of women and children has been a terrible and totally unacceptable prevailing presence in our communities for far too long. We are calling upon men and boys and all South Africans to heed this call of ensuring that we protect and defend our girls, our women and the ANC calls all men and boys to stand up against any form of gender-based violence and to make their voice heard loud and clear in opposition to the abuse of women and children.” Actor Sello Maake Ka-Ncube has led a men’s march from Nasrec in Johannesburg to the Union Buildings in Pretoria in a bid to urge the Presidency to seek better strategies to end GBV. The march under a new movement of South African men called ACT NOW aimed to highlight the scourge of GBV and send a strong message to abusers to stop violating women and children.
