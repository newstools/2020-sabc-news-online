The SA Weather Service says South Africans can expect a chilly, windy and wet mid-week as a cold front makes landfall in the Western Cape on Wednesday. Significant rainfall amounts and snowfalls are forecast for the mountainous regions of the Western and Eastern Cape as well as the extreme southern areas of the Northern Cape from Wednesday. Ahead of this cold front, windy conditions are expected over the south-western parts of the country with strong to gale force north-westerly winds (50-70 km/h) over the interior of the Western and Northern Cape on Tuesday and will continue into Wednesday where gusty winds of 80-90 km/h can be expected.  Weather forecaster, Kholofelo Mahlangu says: “The windy conditions will also spread eastwards over the Free State and northern interior of the Eastern Cape on Wednesday. These strong winds are also expected along the western coastline of the Western Cape spreading along the southern coastal regions and along the Eastern Cape coast by Thursday. The strong winds are expected to result in difficult driving conditions, especially for high-sided vehicles on routes prone to the impacts from strong winds.” Mahlangu adds: “In addition, very rough to high seas, with wave heights between 4.0 to 6.0 m can also be expected along the south-west coast of the Western Cape, spreading along the south coast and reaching the KwaZulu-Natal coast by Friday. During conditions such as these, it is advised that low-lying coastal rocky shores are avoided.”
