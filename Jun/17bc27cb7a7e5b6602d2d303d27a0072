The  North West government and some residents have expressed concern over the rise in numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the province. It emerged during a media briefing in Mahikeng that the province recorded 273 new cases in the past seven days, taking the number of confirmed cases to more than 400. Most of these cases are in the mining sector. “Things have taken a drastic change since that time, as we have surpassed Mpumalanga, Free State, Limpopo and the Northern Cape with a number of confirmed COVID-19 cases,” says Premier Job Mokgoro. With Level 3 regulations still stipulating that citizens should stay at home, it remains a challenge for abide by the rules as many people are still flocking to different towns, forming long queues, with social distancing not observed.

They are calling on government to strengthen the rules and monitor the situation. “I am very scared now, I don’t want to lie, level 3 is not gonna work for us because even now, even in the taxis we adults, we can’t do social distancing. In taxis they said they must put nine passengers but the taxi drivers always they put 15 passengers.” “The shop owners they don’t even control us, they just let us to stand and to do whatever we want and I just think that they should just go back to the drawing table.” “Even as you see now, social distancing is no longer practiced. Even here, there are no signs, showing we should observe social distancing,” say some of the shoppers who flocked to Mahikeng on Saturday.

Its attitude of South Africans on their health. Go to Mahikeng town today, you will see how they behave. South Africans only stay home when they see a police officer or a soldier. These are the consequences, as I stand here Premier, I think I must review the status of Rusternburg. They are the reason why we are in a crisis like this. It means we will be number three just because of Rusternburg and Matlosana,” says MEC for Health, Madoda Sambatha. At least 507 new cases for transgression and violations of lockdown regulations were recorded in the previous week. Those who will be going to churches this weekend are urged to abide by the COVID-19 rules, which are aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus.
