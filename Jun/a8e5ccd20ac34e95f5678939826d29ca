This week on Influential Africans, we look at the life of African academic-historian, Dr Cheikh Anta Diop. Born in the 1920s in Senegal, Diop is an accomplished scientist and politician whose work continues to inspire African scholars. His legacy lives in his native country of Senegal, where Dakar University was renamed to Cheikh Anta Diop University in his honour. In his lifetime, Diop wrote many books on the subject of pre-colonial Africa and ancient Egyptian dynasties. For more on Dr Cheikh Anta Diop, see video below:
