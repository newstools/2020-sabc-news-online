The South African taxi industry has accused Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula of not taking them seriously after a scheduled meeting between the Minister and taxi organisations was postponed yet again. The meeting was organised for Saturday at 1pm and then postponed to Sunday at the same time. Taxi organisations have now been informed that the meeting has been moved to Monday. The Transport Department has not been available for comment. The meeting is expected to discuss increasing taxis loading capacity from 70 percent and government’s COVID-19 relief fund for the taxi industry. Spokesperson for the South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO), Thabisho Molelekwa, said the matter has been mishandled “We do not appreciate his handling of this thing and I think even if you are not in the taxi industry as an ordinary person you would realise that you are not being taken seriously. Last night around to 12 , we did receive an SMS from the ministry saying let’s make the meeting at 13:00 today. About an hour and a half ago, we receive a message to say the Minister has requested the meeting to be postponed to tomorrow.” Angry taxi drivers share their frustrations after meeting with Transport Minister during a protest in Gauteng last week:
