President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the easing of lockdown regulations against restaurants and personal beauty care services including salons. He made the announcement during his address to the nation on the 100th day of the national lockdown at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Wednesday. But he issued a stern warning against the abuse of alcohol which he said contributes to criminality, especially gender-based violence. Although President Ramaphosa is insisting that the national lockdown was necessary to curb the spread of the coronavirus, he however admits that a continued economic shutdown is not sustainable. And beauty salons have lodged a court challenge after not being allowed to operate for over 80 days prompting the President to lift the lockdown regulations against a number of businesses. The President also stressed that all these businesses will be opened under strict conditions adhering to the lockdown regulations.
