Northern Cape Education MEC Mac Jack says four schools in the province’s Pixley Ka Seme district remain closed after a spike in coronavirus infections in the area prevented the reopening of schools last week. The district more than doubled its number of infections since the beginning of June causing the departments of health and education in the area to keep schools closed. Jack says 15 other schools in the area have reopened, but a cautious approach has to be taken with others. More than 1 400 learners and teachers in the Northern Cape’s Pixley ka Seme district were expected to return to schools on Wednesday. “That is because we ordered that the schools be disinfected again for the second time and they could only do it this morning. That’s why we said those affected schools should not open. But the rest of the schools are opening.” The Northern Cape has a total of 211 positive cases. In the video below, is a report on the re-opening of 19 Northern Cape schools:  Various other schools across the country have had to either pause on learners returning or temporary close doors due to COVID-19 fears. In Gauteng alone, at least 56 Gauteng schools were closed last week after positive cases of COVID-19 were detected.
