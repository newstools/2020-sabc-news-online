Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato has told President Cyril Ramaphosa that the city and the province have set aside over R47 million towards the operating and catering costs for the COVID-19 hospital that has been established in the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). Ramaphosa is in the Western Cape to assess its response to the virus. The province currently accounts for more than two-thirds of the national COVID-19 cases with more than 27 000 positive cases and 651 deaths. Plato says the pandemic has become the greatest challenge for the Western Cape government with the peak still expected to come. He says, “The CTICC building is available until the 27th of July with the option to extend on a month to month basis until the end of the year. The CTICC has generously waivered the hiring costs of the venue, the temporary structure bill of operating and catering costs for the initial hire period will total approximately R47 million.”  Live stream for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s visit to Cape Town: In the Free State, Health Head of Department, Dr David Motau, has told Deputy President David Mabuza that the province has plans in place to curb the rising number of coronavirus infections in the province. There are 322 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Free State, with nine fatalities. Motau says more resources will be directed at hotspots in the province. He says, “We are really making sure that we try and contain the scourge of the virus. Our worry is Bethulie cases that are beginning to rise, it’s a small town of about 7000 people and we have to make sure that we close down that place. We have the experience, we have done that before when we had a challenge with churches and we are going to use the same strategy to deal with that.”– Additional reporting by Thabiso Radebe.
