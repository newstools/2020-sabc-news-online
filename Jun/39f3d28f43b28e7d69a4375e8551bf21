A brand new state-of-the-art, fully equipped emergency and critical care COVID-19 testing and treatment hospital is set to be built in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, in the next few weeks. The facility is a joint effort by 80 professionals comprising of actuaries, engineers, doctors, architects and project specialists. It will be named the Cecilia Makiwane Gallagher Critical Care Hospital, in recognition of South Africa and the continent’s first black registered professional nurse and human rights campaigner. It will be equipped with high care or critical care specifications. The project is the brainchild of Dr Johan Pretorius, a medical doctor and a director of the Universal Healthcare Foundation, who shares a heartfelt calling and mission with the group of like-minded professionals who are devoting their time to the project pro-bono. The hospital will initially have 524 beds and is designed to be upscaled to 1178 beds, without the need to build a second duplicate infrastructure. This facility is aimed at being fully operational by the time South Africa reaches the peak of the pandemic, which based on current estimates, would be in July or August 2020.
