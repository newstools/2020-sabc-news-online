A 31-year-old serial rapist in Kimberley has been sentenced by the Northern Cape High Court to 441 years in prison for rape, robbery, attempted robbery and kidnapping. Ndumiso Giyani was found guilty on 14 charges of rape, 12 of robbery, two charges of attempted robbery and six charges of kidnapping. Between 2014 and 2018, Giyani wreaked havoc in Galeshewe, where he would rob women, drag them into bushes and rape them. He was finally arrested in 2019. Northern Cape Police Spokesperson Sergio Kock says, “Today, Judge Mathebe Phatshoane reiterated that Giyani has to be removed from society and the sentences were given as follows: three life sentences for three charges of rape; 19 years imprisonment each for the other 11 charges of rape; 15-year imprisonment each for 12 charges of robbery with aggravated circumstances; 14 years for one charge of attempted robbery with aggravated circumstances; 5-year imprisonment each for six counts of kidnapping. The sentences will run concurrently with the three life sentences.”
