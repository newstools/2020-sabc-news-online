South Africa has registered a record number of new infections for the second day in a row with 7 334 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total confirmed cases to 138 134 on Sunday. The Western Cape still has the bulk of the total cases, accounting for 43.8% (60 445) of the country’s COVID-19 confirmed cases. A total of 43 more people have succumbed to the virus, bringing the country’s total deaths to 2 456. Dr Zweli Mkhize said in a statement that the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases means that the country is approaching its peak. “We are seeing a rapid rise in the cumulative number of positive COVID-19 cases indicating that, as we had expected, we are approaching a surge during the latter winter months of July and August. It is anticipated that while every province will, unfortunately, witness an increase in their numbers, areas, where there is a high economic activity, will experience an exponential rise, beginning with Gauteng and Western Cape and followed by Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal,” reads the statement in part. 68 925 people have recovered from the virus.   1 567 084 138 134 68 925  66 753  2 456 38 075  71 381  As at 28 ﻿June 2020 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Provincial issues Dr Mkhize says he believes that Gauteng will make up the bulk of total infections in the coming days. “Factors contributing to this trend are inward migration; the large population (especially in metros like Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane); increased congregating which spurs cluster outbreaks; and the level to which people are able to adapt to new behaviours such as social distancing and the wearing of masks,” the Minister said. The easing of the national lockdown to Level 3 has led to an increased movement of people. The Minister says the recent surge in COVID-19 infections developed due to seeding of infections carried in by members of the community as they moved back into the workplace. Dr Mkhize says, as a result, cluster outbreaks were inevitable. He has urged South Africans to focus on adhering to recommendations pertaining to non-pharmaceutical interventions.
