Mexico’s Deputy Health Minister said on Tuesday that the novel coronavirus had reached its maximum intensity in the country after the Ministry reported a record increase in daily cases. The Ministry said on Tuesday there were an additional 3 891 cases of the coronavirus and 470 more deaths. That brought the total number of known cases to 97 326, with 10 637 deaths. Health authorities have said the real number of cases is higher. “The coronavirus epidemic is at its maximum level of intensity,” Hugo Lopez-Gatell, who has spearheaded the country’s response to the outbreak, said during a regular news conference. Lopez-Gatell added that the decline in cases was usually slower than the ascent.
