Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says 97.6% of public schools are ready to receive learners from Monday.  Motshekga was addressing a media conference from Pretoria. Motshekga says she has received reports that confirm the readiness for classes to resume for grades 7 and 12 across the country tomorrow. The Minister had to postpone the scheduled resumption of classes last Monday to this Monday amid delays in sanitation procedures and the delivery of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). The Western Cape was the only province to resume schooling under level three lockdown regulations on June first. Motshekga says vandalism of schools is one of the reasons for the delay in opening across the country. She says a total of 1 672 schools were vandalised – including a number in the past week. Below is the live stream of the Minister’s address:  Earlier on Sunday, teacher unions and governing bodies cautiously welcomed the report on the progress the Department of Basic Education has made to ensure that all schools are ready to reopen and have the necessary personal protective equipment needed for teaching and learning.
