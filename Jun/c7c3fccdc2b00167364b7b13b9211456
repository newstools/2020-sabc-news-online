KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu says the spread of the coronavirus infections in the Ilembe district is due to cluster infections in work places. The province has 3 555 positive cases and 62 deaths.

Simelane-Zulu says infections began to decrease when health officials were able to control the cluster areas:  Measures in place to tackle rising cases The first case of COVID-19 in South Africa was recorded in KwaZulu-Natal in March, but now has been overtaken by provinces such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Gauteng. Since then, Simelane Zulu says swift action had to be taken in a bid to avoid overwhelming increases in cases. These interventions up until now include investment in field hospitals, including the Pietermaritzburg Royal Show grounds and the Durban Exhibition Centre. The province says it is also looking into renovating its own facilities to meet the National Health Insurance (NHI) requirements beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recruitment of almost 5 000 healthcare workers.
