Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says his province is likely to hit the 100 000 mark of COVID-19 infections in the coming weeks. The province accounts for well over 60% of the national infection rate and has recorded over 500 deaths, with a significant number of people still in hospitals. Speaking to Motsweding FM’s Current Affairs Show, Winde says they will mitigate the current surge of infections, by reinforcing their testing capacity and ensuring the health system is not overburdened. Winde says, “We know that next week, the number will be double to what they are this week. Every 8 days the numbers are doubling. We had 80 000 which was the projection and will probably go up to 120 000 because we have re-assessed our models. “But we probably have one of the most robust public health systems in the province,” added Winde.
