Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says teachers belonging to schools that have received personal protective equipment (PPEs) and met health standards must return to work for induction during the course of this week. Motshekga has apologised for rescheduling her Sunday night briefing on whether schools would reopen on Monday, amid on-going consultations. Speaking during a media briefing in Rustenburg, in the North West, Motshekga says schools must resume operations next Monday, the 8 of June. “So on Saturday, we resolved that teachers whose schools have received personal protective equipment will be expected to report to work on June 1. So, we are expecting teachers to come today. As late as Saturday, there were schools that did not receive their PPEs from the provinces. So we have agreed that we must finalise all deliveries of PPEs to schools and the outstanding provision of water and sanitation. Teachers and support staff should be inducted and orientated for the new environment brought by COVID-19.” This is Motshekga’s apology, saying decisions were taken at a late stage. “From the onset, I really have to acknowledge the furor of yesterday’s media conference and for that, I sincerely apologise. Due to last-minute changes, and the decision that we took on Saturday, forced me to use Sunday to do a series of consultations not to receive learners today. There are major implications for the sector because it was very late by the time that decision was taken,” adds the minister. In the video below, Minister Motshekga address the media
