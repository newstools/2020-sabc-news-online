The World Health Organisation has expressed concern over the fast pace at which the coronavirus pandemic is growing in refugee camps. The WHO says refugees and migrants are playing an important part in efforts to fight the coronavirus by supporting health systems and communities with their skills. WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was speaking in Geneva, Switzerland, saying his organisation remains deeply concerned about the very real and present danger of widespread transmission of COVID19 in refugee camps.  A report published on Friday by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement shows that about 70% of refugees surveyed in Turkey reported having lost their jobs since the start of the COVID19 pandemic. We have a shared duty to do everything we can to prevent, detect and respond to the transmission of COVID-19 among refugee populations. Public health measures that reduce transmission of COVID-19 require strict and sustained implementation. This is difficult to achieve in refugee camps where the public health situation is weak.‚Äù
