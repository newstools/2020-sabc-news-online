The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has given assurance that it will engage with taxi associations on their proposed taxi fare increases. This, after the Alexandra Taxi Association said it would hike their prices from 11-rand to 30 rand. Taxi associations have cited the loss in revenue after government implemented regulations amid the coronavirus pandemic. Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula has also warned against unjustified and unfair increases. I will engage with the industry to seek clarity on the latest developments. https://t.co/c1BPZBL23Z — Minister of Transport |Mr Fix (@MbalulaFikile) June 7, 2020  “Whilst we understand the predicament that the associations find themselves in, we wish to inform the public that Santaco will be having a national leadership meeting this week.” “Among other issues for discussion will be the taxi fare increase to look at the whole COVID-19 impact and other related issues that have impacted the operations of the taxi increase to try and understand how they could have arrived at that increase.” In May Santaco called on taxi operators to stop inflating fares.
