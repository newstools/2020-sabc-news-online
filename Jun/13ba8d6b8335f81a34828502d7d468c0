Pharmaceutical giant Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd says it has enough capacity to produce sufficient supply of the Dexamethasone vaccine. The drug has been proven effective in improving the likelihood of survival in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Aspen, South Africa’s biggest supplier of drugs, manufactures both the injectable and tablet forms of the drug mainly used for treatment of tumours, asthma and other respiratory ailments. The Department of Health says government currently has a stock of 300 000 ampoules of dexamethasone and can secure supplies of the drug from local manufacturers. Aspen says the drug would not burden government’s already-strained budget as the injectable version would cost around R10 while each tablet would cost around R2.
