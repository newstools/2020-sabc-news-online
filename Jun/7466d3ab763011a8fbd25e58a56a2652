The government of Botswana has effected a zonal lockdown in the Greater Gaborone COVID-19 Zone. Movement out of the zone, which refers to areas of Ramatlabama in the south of Botswana to Dibete, is restricted. Movement into the zone is only permitted to those with valid inter-zonal permits and only essential services will be permitted while all other services are closed. The government has also shut down the Gaborone Private Hospital and Stanbic Bank in the capital Gaborone due to possible coronavirus exposure. Staff, patients and visitors of these facilities between June 8 and 12, have been advised to self-quarantine. “We have decided to shut down or lockdown Greater Gaborone. Which means Gaborone will undergo a period of extreme social distancing or lockdown until further notice. This means only essential services as described in Phase 1 of the previous lockdown will be permitted,” says Dr Malaki Tshipayagae, Director of Health Service in Botswana.
