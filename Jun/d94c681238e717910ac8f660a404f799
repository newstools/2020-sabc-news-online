The Precious Blood Sisters Convent at Ikwezi Lokusa township in Mthatha is in mourning following the death of five nuns this month due to Covid-19. The convent also serves as an old age home. It’s been a devastating month at the Precious Blood Sisters Convent. A fifth nun passed away just after 10am Wednesday morning. They were between 66 to 84 years old. Some had chronic illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure. Sisters at the Convent, which houses 44 nuns, are overcome with grief. Sister Nokwanda Bam, a nun, says they are very sad. “This is a tragedy. They are hurt beyond words. But they are grateful for the help they’ve been receiving from other people. Some come and ask what can they offer them? But this is a very devastating situation for them here. They don’t know who is next.” The Convent was declared safe for quarantine and isolation by the Department of Health. However, sisters and workers fear for their safety. “We would appreciate a lot if we could get nurses who will look after the sick sisters. We also need PPE’s and we want this place fumigated so that when things go back to normal we live in a clean place,” says Bam. The Department of Health was quick to assist. Sizwe Kupelo Health Department Spokesperson, says, “We have now allocated a medical doctor and five nurses to support. We would also like to urge our people to be extra cautious and wear their masks and wash their hands regularly.” 21 of the 44 Sisters at the Convent have tested positive for COVID-19. Two others are awaiting their results.
