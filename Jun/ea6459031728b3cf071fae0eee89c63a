South African businesswoman Bridgette Motsepe has hired an international law firm to defend her against allegations of money laundering and fraud. Botswana’s government accuses her of the illicit flow of money as well as laundering relating to the 2019 national election. In the video below, Motsepe denies money laundering accusations:  The Pan African Parliament Ambassador denies the allegations. She claims the Botswana government hasn’t reached out to her as yet. A fall out between President Mokgweetsi Masisi and the former President Ian Khama has somehow led to Motsepe being accused in alleged international criminal activity. Botswana has also secured legal assistance from AfriForum’s private prosecuting unit in South Africa, after previously accusing the country of failure to assist with the probe. Political observers say the fallout will likely affect relations between the two countries. The matter against Motsepe will be before the High Court of Botswana next week Tuesday. In 2019, the woman accused alongside  the mining tycoon for money-laundering was granted bail by a High Court in Gaborone. Welheminah Maswabi is accused of being a co-signatory with Motsepe to bank accounts that fraudulently moved money across borders. Motsepe regards Botswana as her second home. She studied at the University of Botswana while that country’s current President Mokgweetsi Masisi was also a student at the same institution.
