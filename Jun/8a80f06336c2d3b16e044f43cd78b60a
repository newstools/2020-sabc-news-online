Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga will address the media at 16h00 on schools’ readiness to reopen. While Western Cape schools reopened last Monday for Grade 7s and 12s, learners in other provinces are expected to go back to class this coming Monday. The department initially announced that all Grade 7 and 12 learners would go back to classrooms on the 1st of June but called it off last Sunday night after conceding that all schools were not equipped to safely reopen in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.
