ActNow, the movement of men against gender-based violence (GBV) is calling for constitutional reform, police reform, functional rape crisis centres, the establishment of GBV centres, family nucleus and men and boy child dialogue. These are contained in a petition which the movement intends to submit to the Presidency on Sunday. The movement is marching from Johannesburg to Pretoria, as an act of standing against perpetual GBV. “We are marching to serve a petition that we have put together as a movement of men who are against gender-based violence and we are saying enough is enough. This stops now. So there is a request that we are sending to the Presidency and to our ministers as well,” says Tebogo Lerole, Chief Organiser. In the video below actor Sello Maake Ka-Ncube elaborates:  There has been a rise in GBV cases since alert Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown began on June 1. The spike in GBV  since the start of the lockdown has sent shockwaves across the country. In the first week alone, the South African Police Service (SAPS) has recorded 2300 complaints of GBV. However, many remain unreported.  Meanwhile, police say they’re following up leads after the body of a 17-year-old girl was found in Philippi on the Cape Flats. Spokesperson, Andre Traut, says the cause of her death is yet to be determined. The girl’s death comes during a public outcry against GBV in South Africa. “The circumstances around the death of a 17-year-old girl are being investigated by Nyanga police after her naked body was discovered in Albert Luthuli street in Browns Farm this morning at around seven o’clock.
