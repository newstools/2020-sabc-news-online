More than 1 400 learners and teachers in the Northern Cape’s Pixley ka Seme district are expected to return to schools on Wednesday, after an increase in COVID-19 infections in the area prevented schooling last week. The district has more than doubled its number of infections since the beginning of June – rising from 28 cases to 59. The Northern Cape has a total of 156 positive cases. The provincial department’s spokesperson, Lehuma Ntuane, insists that it is now safe for learners to return to school. “Our decision to reopen these schools follows a joint meeting between the MECs of Education and Health in the province, which concluded that these schools should open. We have processed the decontamination and deep cleaning of these schools, as well as the provision of psycho-social support to the school management teams, educators and non-teaching staff,” explains Ntuane. COSAS wants learners tested for COVID-19 before they re-enter schools The Congress of South African Students (COSAS) is demanding that learners be tested for COVID-19 prior to them re-entering schools. The student body says there are schools that have not fully implemented strict control guidelines to combat the spread of COVID-19 in institutions and say they have already removed learners from schools in Bloemfontein, Botshabelo and Welkom in the Free State – citing non-compliance at the institutions. COSAS Deputy Secretary General Xola Booi says they are identifying schools that are not complying with lockdown and sanitization measures, as it embarks on shutting down places of learning amid the pandemic. Booi says, “We have decided to shut down the schools as of today because we are demanding testing for all learners that are going to schools, not just screening because screening does not mean that they have been tested. We have a number of schools that we have already identified from all nine provinces.” The video below, takes a look at the first week of schooling:
