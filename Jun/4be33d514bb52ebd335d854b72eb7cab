There has been a spike in alcohol-related crimes since South Africa moved to level 3 of the nationwide lockdown. This has sparked concerns that the lifting of the ban may reverse the gains made so far in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.  The largest hospital in Africa, the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is one of the health facilities that are treating COVID-19 patients. Officials say trauma cases have been increasing since Monday. Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize has expressed concern over this. He has echoed President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s call to South Africans to drink and act responsibly. Law enforcement agencies on the other hand have reiterated that those caught violating lockdown regulations will be brought to book. Below is an infographic of what will be permitted during level 3 lockdown:  Saturday marked the first weekend since South Africans were allowed to buy alcohol amid the coronavirus lockdown that began in late March.
