Police Minister Bheki Cele is concerned about possible revenge attacks following a mass shooting that took place in Jabulani Hostel on Monday night. Cele visited the area where the incident took place and spoke to members of the community. The motive behind the shooting that killed 6 people and injured one other person is still unknown. “Shock and horror still reign supreme as no one can make sense of the killing nor did anyone expect such a tragedy.
