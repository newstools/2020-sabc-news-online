A 37-year-old man who allegedly raped his 13-year-old daughter at Masoyi village near White river in Mpumalanga is expected to appear before the Kabokweni Magistrates Court on Thursday. It is alleged the suspect forcefully undressed his daughter and raped her in the presence of her step mother at their home. According to police, the suspect allegedly called the victim into the bedroom and instructed her to undress and the victim refused and ran out of the house. The father then allegedly followed her, grabbed her back into the house, forcefully undressed her and forced himself on her. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says this is the third recent case of a biological father allegedly raping his daughter.
