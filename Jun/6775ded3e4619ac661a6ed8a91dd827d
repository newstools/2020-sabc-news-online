Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku says Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi’s decision to self-isolate is a precautionary measure and doesn’t mean he is infected with the coronavirus. Lesufi came into contact with two of his staff members who have since tested positive for the coronavirus. The Gauteng Command Council has announced that since March, about 335 employees of the provincial government, including health care workers and educators have tested positive for the virus. Masuku also says members of the Command Council as well as staff from his office who have tested positive are also in self-isolation. “We just need to clarify quite well the issue of MEC Lesufi that he’s not saying at any point that he’s not well. We’re taking precautionary measures waiting for his results from the tests that he has done, because he has been exposed to individuals, his officials in his office, that have tested positive. We just need to clarify that it’s not about him being positive, it’s taking precautions to await the results.” Meanwhile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the 335 people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the province since March, are among the more than 172 000 employees of the provincial government. Gauteng has just under 8 000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 57 deaths.

He says those affected include healthcare workers and educators. “In total, the cumulative number now is 335, in there it includes those who’ve recovered. It is important that we also report as a workplace about this, like all other patients, staff members affected and their families are also receiving support, they’re receiving care, they’re receiving various forms of support. And those we need to make sure we put in quarantine because they can’t self-isolate we’ve been able to do so.” In the video below, Makhura briefs the media on hotspots and reopening of schools amid COVID-19:
