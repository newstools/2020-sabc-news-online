The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) says it is concerned about the low number of domestic workers who are receiving coronavirus (COVID 19) cash relief. The UIF says over 35 000 domestic workers received a total of more than R128 million between April 16th and June 17th. The Fund says more needs to be done to assist domestic workers to cope with the implications of the lockdown. The UIF has again encouraged employers to register their domestic workers with the fund. The UIF says it has paid a cumulative R23 billion since mid-April to workers and of that – R6 billion was paid in COVID-19 claims in May alone. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa had announced a R500 billion stimulus package to assist businesses, workers and unemployed South Africans. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced R500 billion COVID-19 economic stimulus package:  Outrage over UIF payment Meanwhile, many South Africans have expressed their outrage over the UIF  payment process. People say after years of contributing to the UIF, they were paid only a few rands as the country finished the sixth week of the COVID-19 enforced national lockdown. Many business owners as well as their employees feel that the UIF has left them in the lurch, as they are in a financial crisis. Others are frustrated after their claims were rejected and have lamented the slow pace at which payments are being processed.
