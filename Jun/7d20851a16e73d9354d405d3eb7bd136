Kenya’s Chief Justice David Maraga has called out the country’s leadership for failing to respect court orders, warning that this may lead the East African country to anarchy. Maraga says the government has frustrated efforts by the judiciary to dispense justice faster, as President Uhuru Kenyatta has refused to approve the appointment of 41 judges. He says this has led to a backlog of cases in the courts. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive has been strained since the beginning of President Kenyatta’s term in office following the nullification of his presidential election victory. A visibly frustrated Maraga said he opted to address the judiciary’s grievances after President Kenyatta ignored his request for a face to face meeting. Maraga says the country’s leadership has several ignored court orders warning that this risked the country’s constitutional democracy. Maraga went on to say the citizens should expect a delay in the dispensation of justice as the country reopens its court on Tuesday as the president has ignored two court orders to appoint judges. President Kenyatta and Chief Jsutice Maraga have in the past used the media to attack each other with Kenyatta blaming the courts for failing to convict corruption suspects and Justice Maraga accusing the executive of undermining the judiciary.
