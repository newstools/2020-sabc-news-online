Police Minister Bheki Cele says the new wave of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal is a cause for concern. Cele visited the family of a slain African National Congress (ANC) councillor in Umlazi on Thursday afternoon. He said police are investigating eight new murder cases of politicians in the province. In the video below, KwaZulu-Natal ANC condemns the killing of Bhekithemba Phungula:  On Tuesday, eThekwini councillor Bhekithemba Phungula was gunned down at his home. He is the third councillor in the municipality to be killed since 2016. While the motive for the murder is unknown, Phungula’s case was handed over to the political killings task team. Cele says while the spike in killings is worrying, the investigating team has been making progress. “There’s been progress made by the police, even though there are concerns about the team. There are many hitmen who have been arrested but maybe the police need to work harder to find those who hired the hitmen,” says Cele. The ANC in the province has raised concerns over the attacks and the slow pace of arrests.
