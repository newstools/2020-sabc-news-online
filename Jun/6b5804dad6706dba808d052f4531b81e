The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued new guidelines on the use of face masks as the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. The organisation says the wearing of a mask alone will not protect you from the virus. The global tally of infections now stands at over 6.8 million infections with more than 398 000 deaths and over 3.3 million recoveries. Addressing a briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says masks must be worn in conjunction with a comprehensive plan of good hand hygiene and social distancing. “In areas with community transmission, we advise that people aged 40 years or over or those with underlying conditions should wear a medical mask in situations where physical distancing is not possible. People can potentially infect themselves if they use contaminated hands to adjust a mask or to repeatedly take it off and put it on without cleaning hands in between. Masks can also create a false sense of security. Masks are only of benefit as part of a comprehensive approach in the fight against COVID-19.”  In the Infographic below are more guidelines on wearing masks:
