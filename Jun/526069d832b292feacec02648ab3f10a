The High Court in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, has granted an application for an interdict against the National Freedom Party (NFP), stopping the party from suspending or removing KwaZulu-Natal Chairperson Vikizitha Mlotshwa from the provincial legislature. Mlotshwa took the party to court after the leadership that was elected in Ulundi in 2019 decided to suspend him from the party. He is being accused of misconduct and embezzlement of party funds. Mlotshwa and the NFP leadership have been at loggerheads over the legitimacy of the conference. The case in which he is challenging the legitimacy of the conference is yet to be heard in court. In May, the party asked him to resign from the provincial legislature, but he refused to do so. The case about Mlotshwaâ€™s suspension has been adjourned to July 10 for the NFP to file replying affidavits. In the video below, NFP faction convenes conference:
