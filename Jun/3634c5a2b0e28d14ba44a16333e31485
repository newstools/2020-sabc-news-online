The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has held a silent protest against brutality by law enforcement officials. The protest follows an army report that found South African National Defence Force members not liable for Collins Khosa’s death. The religious leaders have denounced this report as “unreal.” “It feels like we’ve been here before, yes, in apartheid days, or in George Floyd’s Minneapolis! What a week to announce this ‘No one to blame’ verdict,” says the SACC’s Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana. The religious leaders staged a silent protest at St Albans Anglican Cathedral, whilst also other protest prayers led by Archbishop Thabo Makgoba, were held at the Cape Town St George’s Anglican Cathedral.  Alexandra resident, Khosa, died allegedly at the hands of defense force members during the lockdown in April. He is one of 11 civilians killed allegedly during the actions of police and defense force members. “Our intention is that his silent protest will be a clear expression of our disdain for the current brutality exhibited by our police and defence forces and to call for greater accountability and justice for these families. We are also standing in the gap for ordinary citizens who are equally experiencing the grief and mourning that this current moment has brought upon us,” reads the SACC’s statement.  President Cyril Ramaphosa has said government will ensure that those responsible for Khosa’s death will be brought to book and face the full might of the law. Ramaphosa says the military and police must determine the exact circumstances surrounding Khosa’s death. In the video below, his family says they won’t rest until justice is served:
