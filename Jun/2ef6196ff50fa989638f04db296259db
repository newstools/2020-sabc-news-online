The CEO of Lepelle Northern Water Board in Limpopo has accused Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu of acting illegally when she suspended him. Phineas Legodi was suspended last week over allegations of maladministration and corruption. The entire board of the organisation has also been suspended. Legodi says Sisulu does not have the power to suspend him.  He also claims she acted illegally by appointing a caretaker board last Thursday. Legodi also blames the department for the failure of the multi-million rand water project in Giyani. “I wish to state without equivocation. I’ve never been placed on any form of suspension or any manner of disruption of work. I am still in the active and unthwarted employ of Lepelle Northern Water as the substantive chief executive,” says Legodi. He says he is taking the matter to court. “Upon hearing the news of my suspension, I immediately instructed my attorneys off the record to engage the Minister and the department with a view to get clarity to the matter and clear confusion. Accordingly, a correspondence was sent to the two esteemed offices on the 7th of May 2020.” Legodi insists that the suspended board will complete its term of office, ending in 2024. The Lepelle Northern Water Board has been investigated by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), the Hawks as well as the office of the Auditor General for alleged maladministration and corruption. The Water and Sanitation Department could not be reached for comment. In the video below, SIU raids Lepelle Northern Water Board offices:
