Cabinet says despite the on-going legal battle faced by government on the lockdown regulations, people should continue to take all measures to ensure they are protected from the coronavirus. Government announced on Thursday that it was appealing a decision by the High Court in Pretoria, which declared that Level 3 and 4 lockdown regulations are unconstitutional and invalid. In the video below, Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, briefs the media following the Cabinet meeting:  The court suspended the judgment for two weeks to give government a chance to amend and republish the regulations. Below is the full judgment:  Cabinet spokesperson Phumla Williams says they do not want to cause confusion over the regulations amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We still expect South Africans to minimise movement where it is not necessary and also wash their hands. They [cabinet] sought legal advice and this matter can be appealed and also to apply for urgency to deal with this matter. Because we cannot afford to leave South Africans in this grey environment when the matter is so serious.” “We have people who are dying, people who are continuing to be infected, so we cannot afford to get South Africans confused,” explains Williams. In the video below, Director General of Government Communications and Information Systems Phumla Williams explains why government is appealing the court ruling:  Liberty Fighters Network to oppose any appeal against lockdown ruling The Liberty Fighters Network says it’s ready to oppose any appeal by government to the court judgment declaring some regulations under lockdown Levels 3 and 4 unconstitutional and invalid.
