Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo says personal protective gear will be delivered to townships as the number of coronavirus infections is expected to surge due to the easing of lockdown regulations. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) has donated personal protective equipment to the City of Johannesburg in Braamfontein.  The R1.5-million donation is expected to assist frontline health workers. Makhubo says the coronavirus has further exacerbated the inequalities in the country. “This will go a long way in helping us curb the spread of the coronavirus and of course this PPE is needed not only by our communities, but by our frontline staff as well. There are communities that can’t even afford even a simple mask, they can’t afford sanitizer and it’s through donations like this that we’ll be able to reach out to those communities in informal settlements that really need these,” says Makhubo.
