The SABC says it has not received a summons from the broadcaster’s former COO, Chris Maroleng. Maroleng is challenging his dismissal from the corporation. According to the court papers seen by SABC News, Maroleng alleges that his dismissal was unlawful and that he was not allowed to appeal against it. Maroleng also alleges that SABC CEO, Madoda Mxakwe, and SABC Chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini, illegally plotted his axing. When approached for comment on the matter, Acting SABC Spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo said the corporation has not received court papers relating to Maroleng’s court bid. “The SABC can confirm that the Corporation is not in receipt of any court papers relating to Mr Maroleng’s intention to sue the organisation, therefore we are unable to comment further on this matter,” says Seapolelo. Maroleng was fired from the public broadcaster in 2019 after a disciplinary process. He was found guilty of breaching his fiduciary duties, acting in a manner which breaches good faith, trust, honesty, loyalty and confidence as well as gross negligence.
