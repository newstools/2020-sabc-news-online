South Africa is commemorating  Youth Day, in memory of students who lost their lives in the 1976 protest against Afrikaans being the medium of instruction at schools. This year Youth Day is celebrated virtually under the theme “Youth Power: Growing South Africa together in a period of COVID-19.” The day is used to remember the uprising that resulted in the deaths of many learners and to reflect on how far the country has come in addressing issues affecting the youth.
