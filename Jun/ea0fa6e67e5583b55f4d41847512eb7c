Meanwhile, the High Court in Pretoria will rule on Wednesday on the urgency of the application brought by Educators Union of South Africa (Eusa) which is challenging the decision to reopen schools. The union wants the court to set aside the reopening of schools by the Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. The union argues that the threat posed by COVID-19 is great and returning to school poses a greater threat to learners and educators.
