A large number of discarded used coronavirus test kits have been picked up by health laboratory service officials in the Eastern Cape. The kits were apparently dumped next to the N2 between East London and King Williamstown. The discarded test kits had been discovered by a passer-by. They were still in plastic sleeves and contained the details of the person from whom the sample was taken. At this stage it is not clear how the kits ended up on the side of a national road. The Eastern Cape health department’s spokesperson, Sizwe Kupelo, says investigations are under way but the matter is between the National Health Laboratory Services and the courier company they use. “We are working with them to establish the facts of what happened, because it happened, while the items were in transit while outside our facilities, so NHLS has to answer together with the courier company they were using,” he says.
