The PIC was a significant shareholder in VBS when it was placed under curatorship by the Prudential Authority of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). It says the arrests is an important step in ensuring those who were responsible for the collapse of VBS are held accountable. The National Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Shamila Batohi has also welcomed the arrests.
