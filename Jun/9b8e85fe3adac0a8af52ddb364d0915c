The United States of America is planning to roll out e-labs to reduce turnaround times for COVID -19, HIV and TB tests, to provide data management for hospitals and health facilities in the Eastern Cape. This emerged during a meeting between Eastern Premier Oscar Mabuyane and US Consul General, Virginia Blaser. The rapid rise of infections in the province significantly slows down the turnaround time for test results. The province has the second number of highest number of COVID-19 infections, with 4 324 cases and 82 deaths. The moving map below shows South Africa’s COVID-19 stats as at 02 June, 2020: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Blaser says this is the joint venture between the USA and the Eastern Cape government to improve the lives of people in the province. “Finally the US has committed to donate 1000 ventilators to South Africa and we are working now to respond to the needs of the individual provinces to ensure that these life saving devices are deployed where and when they need to be.” In the tweet below, Blaser further outlines how the United States can support the province:  Mabuyane expressed his appreciation and says this collaboration demonstrates the importance of solidarity to save lives. “So the work continues. We have to join hands and make sure we succeed. We have to defeat this virus. We are trying our level best to disrupt its transmission. If we allow it and allow the numbers to continue as they are, the virus will overwhelm us and collapse our health care facilities.”
