The African National Congress (ANC) has confirmed that one of its MPs Dorah Dlamini has passed away. Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina says Dlamini, who had taken part in a virtual meeting of the National Assembly on the same day, passed away after a sudden illness Tuesday night. The 57-year-old MP, who hailed from KwaZulu-Natal, took up her seat after last year’s general elections. Majodina says the ANC has lost a dedicated public representative who served until her last moments.  The National Assembly released a statement on Dlamini’s passing. “The Presiding Officers, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, are deeply saddened by the passing of Ms Dorah Dunana Dlamini last night.” The statement also said that  Dlamini served in the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises “Despite only joining Parliament last year, Ms Dlamini had already immersed herself well in the workings, intricacies and complexities of Parliament. She took part in the hybrid sitting of the House yesterday, joining through the virtual platform from her home in KwaZulu-Natal, and remained until the end of the session. We are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of such a dedicated parliamentarian,” Parliaments statement further read.
