Ward councillor Angus McKenzie says Zhario Johnson was wounded in the attack on Thursday night, but later died in hospital. He says the boyâ€™s 32-year-old father died on the scene. He adds that it is unacceptable that murders and shootings are going unprosecuted and has called for an end to the violence.
