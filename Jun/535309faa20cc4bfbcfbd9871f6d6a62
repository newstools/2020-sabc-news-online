The South African Liquor Brand-owners Association (SALBA) has praised people for their patience and well-mannered behaviour on Monday as long queues formed amid the sale of alcohol. Shoppers were seen filling their trolleys with cases and bottles of alcohol after government eased lockdown restrictions to allow its sale to resume following a nine week ban. SALBA spokesperson Sibani Mngadi says traders had enough stock for consumers. “We are really excited over the way the traders and the shoppers behaved on the first day. The queues were long, but people were patient and waited to have an opportunity to shop. On the traders’ side, we were able to plan appropriately and make sure that people were in queues with the appropriate dispensing and be able to have an opportunity to shop. It has been a tough period and we appreciate the opportunity to be able to trade,” says Mngadi.
