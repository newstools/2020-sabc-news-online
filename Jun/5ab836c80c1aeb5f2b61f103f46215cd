Comair has announced its intention to halve its fleet of aircraft as part of efforts to rescue the company. Comair, which operates the local British Airways franchise and budget airline Kulula.com, filed for business rescue last month, after restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus forced airlines to stop flying. The Business Rescue Practitioners had said there was a chance that Comair could be saved but have told creditors and employee representatives that the company is unlikely to start operating again before November this year. The practitioners say the airline requires a substantial cash injection to resume operations.
