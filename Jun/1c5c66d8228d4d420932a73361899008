Cape Town police are investigating the death of yet another young woman after the naked body of a 17-year-old was discovered in Philippi on the Cape Flats. Police spokesperson, Andre Traut, says the cause of death is yet to be determined. He says the teen’s body was found at Browns Farm. Traut says no arrests have yet been made. It is the latest in a spate of attacks on women and children that have led to concern nationwide. On Monday the Men’s sector of Takuwane Re eme Movement said more needs to be done to enhance the behaviour of South African men and boys in combating the scourge of gender-based violence. Doctor Matome Kganakga, National Deputy Chairperson of the Men’s sector of Takuwane Re eme Movement said, “The reality is that when you talk about the deterrence of crime it starts in behavioural changes within communities. When it comes to the criminal justice system, we are doing extremely horribly in terms of if you look at the rate of prosecution, it’s literally at less than one percent.” In the past weeks, Tshegofatso Pule, Naledi Phangindawo, Nompumelelo Tshaka and other women in the Eastern Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal were found murdered.
