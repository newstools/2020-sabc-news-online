Sudan’s public prosecutor said Monday a mass grave has been discovered east of the capital Khartoum, allegedly containing students killed in 1998 who tried escaping military service. An investigation has been launched, the prosecutor said, adding that some the suspected killers belonging to the ousted administration of Omar al-Bashir had fled. Bashir and the other detainees are accused of a range of crimes, including involvement in the country’s 1989 military coup, the killing of protesters and corruption. Omar al-Bashir was ousted from power in April 2019 by the military, following months of civilian protests against his 30-year rule. Sudan agrees former-President Bashir should appear before ICC over Darfur Sudan’s government and rebel groups in Darfur agreed that all those wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC ) should appear before the tribunal, a list that includes ousted President Omar al-Bashir. The government and the rebel groups reached an agreement during a meeting in South Sudan’s capital Juba that included “the appearance of those who face arrest warrants before the International Criminal Court”, said Mohamed al-Hassan al-Taishi, a member of Sudan’s sovereign council. Taishi also said that the two sides agreed to create a Darfur special court to investigate and hear cases including those investigated by the ICC.

He said Darfur groups and Sudan’s government had agreed to “fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court,” and that the timing of the handover would be decided in final negotiations. Bashir’s lawyer said the ex-president refused to have any dealings with the ICC because it was a “political court”.
