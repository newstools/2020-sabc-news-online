A sustainable economic recovery plan will top the agenda at Tuesday’s inaugural Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium of South Africa (SIDSSA). It will be officially opened by President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria on Tuesday morning. The symposium is presented as the country tries to find ways to rescue and grow the economy after the COVID-19 period. Ramaphosa recently affirmed that infrastructure investment can contribute to higher long-term growth as it will create much-needed jobs. Head of Infrastructure and Development in the Presidency, Dr. Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, says the symposium is held in conjunction with the private sector. Ramakgopa says, “What these projects do essentially, they are not your classical infrastructure projects in that they are delivering assets…but essentially they give you the opportunity to maximize on the supply side, create as much jobs as possible. We needed to sit with the private sector in order to secure this. Private benefits form the existence of the credit life because they are able to sponsor and in return to that they give returns to their shareholders.”  Platform to explore partnerships SIDSSA is a platform that brings together critical role-players in the infrastructure investment space, who are galvanised around a key goal of accelerating an infrastructure-led economic recovery plan. The symposium is also a platform to explore partnerships between the public and private sectors and investment opportunities in infrastructure. Furthermore, the symposium is intended to shape the conversations about regulatory and policy reforms, innovative funding models for infrastructure and investing in infrastructure for a shared prosperity for all.
