Speaking to SABC News, Mkhize expressed that if people don’t adhere to preventative measures, the number of COVID-19 cases are going to see a sharp increase. “We’re talking about the 97 000 today but in a few weeks we’ll be talking about several hundred thousands and that actually is because of this behaviour. What we’re seeing now, wait for two weeks you will see the impact of how the recklessness that we would have actually seen now, how it will actually translate in the numbers of more new infections that are going to be coming.”
