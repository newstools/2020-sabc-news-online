KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli says the driver of the truck that killed 10 people and injured 32 others at Jozini in the north of the province has been arrested. Ntuli visited the crash scene. A sugar cane truck collided with nine other vehicles including two buses and a minibus, in the town centre. It also ploughed into pedestrians at a hawkers’ market in the town centre. Ntuli says his department has also instituted an investigation to determine the roadworthiness of the truck. “ The driver has been arrested now, I do not want to speculate but I’ve put up a team that will check the soberness of the driver first and whether the vehicle has been regularly serviced because we do not want to speculate but I am sure police have the reasons why they have kept the driver in custody.”
