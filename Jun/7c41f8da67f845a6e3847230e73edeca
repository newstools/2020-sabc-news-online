The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) in KwaZulu-Natal says it will implement a taxi fare increase on 1 July, but it will not be more than a 100%  increase as indicated by other taxi organisations. It was commenting on the proposed taxi fare increase by the Alexandra Taxi Association from R11 to R30 on the Alexandra to Sandton route. The Alexandra, Randburg, Midrand, Sandton Taxi Association (ARMSTA) Spokesperson, Motlanalo Tsebe, says operating under 70% capacity has negatively affected the taxi industry:  In the video below, Department of Transport Spokesperson Ayanda Allie-Payne says the department is aware that with the taxi owners are struggling to make ends meet:  Transport Minister, Fikile Mablula said he would refer the matter to the Competition Commission for it to assess if the fare increase was fair and justifiable. KwaZulu-Natal Santaco Chairperson Boy Zondi says they will discuss the margin of increases with taxi associations. “As Santaco, we have taken a decision as provinces that we will be doing these increases not just Gauteng, but in KwaZulu-Natal. Come 1st of July, there will be fare increases in the taxi industry. Annually, as the taxi industry, we do fare increases. We do this every year, on the 1st and we take into consideration the expenses of a vehicle. So, as the taxi industry in SA, we decided that we are going to do these increases on the 1st of July.”
