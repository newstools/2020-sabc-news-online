Brother Sakhile Mngomezulu says, ”The guy took her at eight at night. My mother received a WhatsApp at 11. We think after he killed her, saying that she will be staying over by him and we will see her the next morning.” The 29-year-old was found on Friday, her body dumped in the Dobsonville area. The family says this was not the first attempt on her life. Mngomezulu says, “He attempted to kill her in 2017. He then tried to poison her. Whenever we asked her to leave him, she said she had a plan, but she was afraid to leave.” For the family, there’s no closure. “We want to know where he killed her. We are worried about her soul. Also, we want answers, why he killed her.” Tshepo Mashego is facing a charge of murder. He will return to court on June 29 for a formal bail application.
