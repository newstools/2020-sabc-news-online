New York City is starting to implement Phase 2 of its reopening trajectory, allowing people to eat outdoors and in-store retail shopping to resume. The region was for months the epicentre of the outbreak in the United States with more than 21 000 COVID-19 deaths. Salons and barbershops are reopening for the first time in more than three months on Monday but will only be allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Businesses that are allowed to reopen include offices, real estate services, in-store retail, and outdoor dining and take-out delivery services. Shoppers should wear masks and maintain social distancing. In the video below, SABC Correspondent, Shewryn Bryce-Peace gives an update on the situation: Despite reaching phase two, many companies have encouraged workers to continue to work from home. The positive test rate in the city now hovers around 1%, down from about 60% in April. The further easing of restrictions will depend on infection rates and hospital capacity continuing to decline and the increased ability of the state to test and contact-trace those who have contracted the virus.
