The University of Cape Town (UCT) announced in April that it had set up an emergency fund to assist in the fight against the virus and its impact on the university. University Spokesperson, Elijah Moholola, said any amount by members of the UCT community, including alumni, staff and students will go a long way towards assisting the university in adjusting to these extraordinary times. “Donations can be made to a specific COVID-19 fund or online. UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng will donate 20% of her salary to the fund for a three-month period.”
