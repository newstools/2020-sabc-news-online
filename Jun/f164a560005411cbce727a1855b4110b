Smokers around Cape Town took to the streets to protest against the continued ban on tobacco products. This comes just days after tobacco companies and the government faced off in court. Protesters braved wet and chilly conditions in Cape Town as they protested outside parliament. Positive about the legal action, they say they can’t wait to stock up. They say the decision to ban cigarettes was illogical and it has nothing to do with COVID-19. They also insist that there’s no scientific proof that cigarettes might add to the pandemic. Some cite the loss of tax revenue, believed to be billions of rands, as their reason for joining the protest. In the video below, smokers protest in Cape Town over continued ban on tobacco.  On Tuesday, the Pretoria High Court reserved judgment in the Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) application to have tobacco products unbanned. Judge Dustin Mlambo said the full bench would consider the submissions of FITA and government and email them the judgment. He assured the parties that they considered the matter to be urgent. Legal representatives for Co-operative Governance Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, told the court that government needed to respond swiftly to the COVID-19 pandemic to help to save lives. However, FITA Chairperson Sinenhlanhla Mnguni said Dlamini-Zuma had overstepped her powers in banning the sale of cigarettes. Advocate Arnold Subel, for FITA, called the ban on tobacco sales irrational, draconian and an act of cruelty. “We’ve termed it a draconian prohibition. A ban of this nature is probably the most dramatic of any measure that can be taken. It is difficult to think of anything more dramatic. Shutting down an entire industry causes enormous harm.” In the video below, the Pretoria High Court reserves judgment on the banning of tobacco:
