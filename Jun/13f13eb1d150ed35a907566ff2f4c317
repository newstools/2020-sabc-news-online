Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has added his voice in condemning the recent incidents of Gender-Based Violence (GBV). During his address at the party’s virtual Youth Day Rally, Malema called on the youth to take up the fight against GBV. This comes in the wake of the killing of Tshegofatso Pule, Naledi Phangindawo and Nompumelelo Tshaka among others recently. Malema says the hate and brutality used during apartheid is now being practised against South African women. “Enough is enough, it is in the hands of you the youth to defeat the violence that is being perpetrated against women in the same way you fought against apartheid. It is the women of South Africa who protected activists from ruthless apartheid security forces risking their own lives, today, such hate and brutality is practised against the women of this country who nurtured us to political freedom. It must come to an end, it is now time for us to take this struggle into our own hands and defend women of South Africa,” says Malema.

In a statement, Amnesty International South Africa urged government to tackle the scourge with the same zeal and coordinated effort as demonstrated with COVID-19. The organisation is also demanding justice for victims and families of GBV and femicide. Amnesty International South Africa wants the Police Minister to urgently take the measures listed below to address the scourge. • Ensure police are gathering evidence in a meticulous manner and are accountable in accordance with the law.
• Ensure police follow timely and due process during investigations.
• Ensure there is no further impunity for cases of femicide or gender-based violence.
• Ensure that corruption of police, also in cases of femicide and gender-based violence, is no longer tolerated.
• Ensure that police are trained to sensitively and objectively investigate incidents of gender-based violence.

Ramaphosa says such qualities were seen during the Fees Must Fall protests and against the killing of George Floyd in the United States. The President, in his capacity as African National Congress (ANC) leader, was speaking to the nation via a televised address as the world embraces the Black Lives Matter movement and the country marks Youth Day. The President adds that government will strengthen laws to provide greater protection to victims of gender-based violence and ensure lengthy jail sentences for perpetrators. “Government is strengthening laws to provide greater protection and support for survivors and increase sentences for perpetrators. We are rolling out more sexual offences courts and providing more training for law enforcement officers. Young people, when you know your friends or relatives are victims, be compassionate and do not judge. Let victims be your guide on how to tackle their situation. Share widely information about professional support available in your community as well as at your educational institutions.”
