Department of Health officials have embarked on an inspection of the Dis-Chem Warehouse in Midrand, Johannesburg.  This is in response to the request by the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers whose members are picketing outside the Dis-Chem warehouse. The Union says the company has not implemented safety measures, even after 10 positive coronavirus cases where reported at the warehouse.   A small group of the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers (Nupsaw) members has gathered outside the Dis-Chem warehouse in Midrand, asking the company to abandon the biometric clocking system.  The union says workers have been asked to sign a document authorising the company to deduct R500 from their salaries for coronavirus testing, which they reject. The union is demanding that all workers be tested and that those who tested positive remain in isolation at home with full pay.
