This after the High Court in Pretoria ruled that COVID-19 patients may not be forced into state quarantine facilities. The group brought the case against the government. Current national lockdown regulations stipulate that anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus, regardless of whether they show symptoms, will be placed in a government isolation facility.
