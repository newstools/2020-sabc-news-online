The Midvaal Local Municipality says police are looking for ring leaders of Elandsfontein land invaders. Residents invaded the privately-owned land earlier this month and erected shacks. On Thursday, the army along with other law enforcement agencies demolished the structures following a court order obtained by the Midvaal Local Municipality. It’s alleged that there is a syndicate in the area that is targeting poor and vulnerable people. Some say they paid R250 for a piece of land. Midvaal MMC for Community Development Mokete Motsamai says police are searching for the ring leaders. Motsamai says those arrested will be charged with contravention of the court order. “As the municipality, we successfully managed to get a blanket court order that then covers all the properties that were not initially included in the other court orders that was applied for by the property owners. So, this morning, as expected, the invaders assembled or had their own meeting to also deal with … their way forward. The information we got on the ground is they are planning to go ahead with the invading over a couple of days,” says Motsamai.
