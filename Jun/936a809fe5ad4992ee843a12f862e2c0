Reverend Bafana Khumalo – from Sonke Gender Justice says as Sunday is Father’s Day, they call on men of faith to examine their role as fathers, brothers, uncles, husbands and partners. “We all need to remember as fathers that the honour of being celebrated is earned by being a good father. A good father to our children, good father in our families. A good father who stands for no violence against women and children. Good fathers who actually take responsibility for their actions. Good fathers who are willing to be held accountable for their actions. Good fathers who support all efforts to bring peace in our homes.” In the video below, “Men of Faith against Gender-Based Violence” 100 Day Campaign launched:  Many social issues have come under the spotlight as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) national lockdown, and domestic violence is one that continues to impact thousands of South Africans who are confined to their homes.
