The personal care industry is open for business again but will have to stick to strict COVID-19 protocols. The new regulations governing hairdressers, barbers, make-up and tattoo artists have been published in the Government Gazette. Handwashing, the wearing of cloth masks and thorough cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces are required. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the reopening of personal care services on Wednesday. It’s a huge relief to businesses who’ve had no income since March. The protocols gazetted by Small Business Development Minister, Khumbudzho Ntshavheni, gives effect to that announcement. Clients are encouraged to pre-book to avoid queues. The 1.5 metre social distance rule stands. Regular wiping down and disinfecting of surfaces is also a necessity. Owners and employees over the age of 60, or with comorbidities, are discouraged from working.  Worry Political Analyst Angelo Fick has expressed concern over the opening up of casinos and hair salons. Fick says this means that it will now be up to individual South Africans, some with a dodgy track record of adhering to regulations, to limit the spread of the coronavirus. “I’m not surprised but I’m also not necessarily enthusiastic about this. Because what this effectively means is that the 58 million people who have not necessarily adhered to all of the protocols under the lockdown will now actually have to seriously consider doing so. Because responsibility for avoiding infection is now entirely in the hands of 58 million people if they’re going to have all of these sectors open.” The full discussion with Fick is in the video below:  Hair and beauty salons had been banned from working since the start of the lockdown on 27 March. Many of them had reportedly resorted to underground operations to put food on the table.
