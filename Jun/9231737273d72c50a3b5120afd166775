Residents of the Mvutshini area at Mtubatuba in the north of KwaZulu-Natal have torched a coal-truck and closed the R 618 going to town. They are demanding the upgrading of access roads, a clinic, police station, electricity, toilets and water. The residents say the reinstatement of former mayor – Qhina Mkhwanazi will be the solution to their problems. Mkhwanazi was in 2017 ordered to step down by the Inkatha Freedom Party’s KwaZulu-Natal Political Oversight Committee due to alleged poor service delivery. One of the residents, Ntombi Chili had this to say. “In Mtubatuba things are not going well, we had our mayor Mkhwabazi who was doing well but removed unfairly. Some senior people in the municipality and some youngsters were told to strike against Mkhwanazi.” Meanwhile, IFP’s Chairperson in KwaZulu Natal Thami Ntuli says the party will attend to issues in the Mtubatuba Municipality. “As the IFP we will be give attention to the issue of Mtubatuba municipality. Already there are matters around Mtubatuba which are on the table which we are deliberating around as the IFP. We were not yet aware then that there has been protests. As the IFP we will be following  up the matter so that we assist the citizens of Mtubatuba municipality to receive quality service delivery.”
