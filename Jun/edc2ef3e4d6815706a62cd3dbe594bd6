African Transformation Movement (ATM) president Vuyolwethu Zungula says government must put South Africans first to make sure that they benefit from all initiatives. He was reacting to the address by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday evening on the easing of alert Level 3 lockdown regulations which will see small businesses getting back to work. The easing of alert Level 3 lockdown regulations will see restaurants re-open, alongside beauty places and salons. In the video below, President Cyril Ramaphosa announces the easing of Level 3 regulations.  Zungula says it would be an embarrassment if the country failed to take care of its citizens during these difficult times. “We want to put it on record that the government needs to be patriotic and ensure that companies that employ a huge amount of South Africans be allowed to work. It is a big shame for the government to allow South African citizens to be excluded economically before, during and after the lockdown; this is the time for government to put South Africa first.” The United Democratic Movement (UDM) said on Thursday that government can do so much in trying to assist South Africans not to be infected with COVID-19. However, it will take the full responsibility by South Africans to do the right thing and obey all the lockdown regulations put in place by those in authority. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said people must just do the right thing and they shall beat this pandemic. The IFP’s national spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said government must not put the economic interest first, but that of the many people who are vulnerable in society. “We totally are against this announcement. It is also confusing because how do you allow more movements in society.” In the video below, there are mixed reactions to President Cyril Ramaphosa announcement on the easing of alert Level 3 regulations.
