The Tshwane Bus Service has Monday morning suspended its services in Olivenhoutbosch due to the taxi shutdown. Taxis have reportedly blocked parts of the R55 in the area. A total shutdown by SA National Taxi Council in Gauteng has left commuters without transport. This is in protest against a relief package announced by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula on Friday. The Tshwane Bus Service says it had to withdraw its busses in parts of Pretoria due to threats and intimidation against their drivers. The bus service has advised commuters to find alternative means of transport.  In Orange Farm, taxi operators have blocked roads with their vehicles making it difficult for buses to operate. This is despite the call by Gauteng MEC for Transport Jacob Mamabolo that those who wish to operate during the strike should not be intimidated. Mbalula says government has allocated more than R1 billion to the taxi industry as a relief fund during the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry says the money is too little.

Top Six says it awaits an outcome of a meeting between their leadership and Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula on Tuesday. Top Six chairperson Nhlanhla Tshabalala says their leaders will discuss their grievances with the Minister and hope to reach consensus.
