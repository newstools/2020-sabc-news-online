The Education Union of South Africa (EUSA) is calling for an independent forensic investigation into alleged looting of COVID-19 funds within the Department of Basic Education. The union alleges that Basic Education procured 3 500 water tanks (Jojo Tanks) for R600 million. That means each tank cost the DBE R171 428.57. According to a quotation received by EUSA from Builders, one 2 000 litre tank costs R1 995, meaning that 3 500 Jojo Tanks should cost R6 982 500. In the video below, EUSA calls for the sacking of Minister Angie Motshekga:  “So, in this project alone, there has been a looting of R593 017 500 of the tax payers’ money within the Basic Education Department alone: double the Nkandla money,” EUSA says in a statement. “The KwaZulu-Natal Education Spokesperson released a statement stating that the department has bought each 500 litre Jojo Tank for R28 000. However, the same capacity Jojo Tank costs R1 349 at Builders,” it adds. EUSA says this means that the KZN education department stole R26 651 from the purchase of each Jojo Tank. The union also accused basic education of having issued tenders for PPEs without due process. EUSA says masks and saniters supplied by the organisations who were granted the tenders were of poor quality and not approved by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS). “This looting spree was the only reason for the rushed reopening of schools and we have been trying to warn the country of this. The alleged reports by specialists have not been made public despite a number of requests from various bodies,” EUSA said. The union is calling on government to give to this matter the same energy they have given to State of Capture and Nkandla security upgrades matter. It says it will lodge a complaint with the Public Protector and open a case with the police on the matter next week. Read EUSA’s full statement below:
