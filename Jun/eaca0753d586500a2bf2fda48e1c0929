Schools can remain open after a High Court ruling on the matter. The High Court in Pretoria rejected an application brought by Educators Union of South Africa (EUSA) which is challenging the decision to re-open schools. The union wanted the court to set aside a decision to re-open schools by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. The union argues that the threat posed by COVID-19 is significant and returning to school poses a greater threat to learners and educators. The High Court rejected the application on the fact that the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Education MECs were not included in the application and that EUSA’s application has been made after schools have reopened. Meanwhile, in a statement, EUSA says the court’s reasoning does not make sense because their application was made before schools reopened and there was a postponement by the court. “This does not make sense as the parties had the right and opportunities to join the application if they had interest. We saw no reason to include the COGTA Minister and MECs because we were not challenging the lockdown regulations or the Disaster Management Act; we were challenging the reckless and deadly decision by Basic Minister Angie Motshekga.” Below is the union’s statement :  EUSA says it will await written judgment for it to decide on their next course of action.
