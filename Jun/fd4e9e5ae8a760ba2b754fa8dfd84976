Eighty-five percent of Gauteng teachers reported for work on the first day of schooling for grade 7’s and 12’s. This is according to Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, who briefed the media on Monday. “We also received 85% teacher attendance. 15% being absent. We’re analysing the reasons why 15% of our educators were absent, but we are quite aware that a number of teachers have filled forms indicating that they’ve got co-existing diseases and therefore, they want authorisation from their medical doctors before they can attend school.” Lesufi says its school feeding scheme will be fully online in the next two weeks. “We’ve now finalised the contract of school nutrition. It will come in the next 15 days. In the process, we’ve transferred funds to all our schools so that our schools can then cater for our children. The reports that we received is that everything went very well. We just needed to intervene in two schools where there was no feeding. Some of the schools wanted to charge learners for feeding. Our team was dispatched there and they’ve managed to rectify the situation.” Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi briefs the media about the first day of school:  COVID-19 cases Lesufi says the department is investigating 8 more coronavirus cases in schools. “In terms of schools that reported cases, we were at 30 yesterday, we are at 38 today in terms of personnel – that is both learners and educators. We were at 30 yesterday. We are at 39 today in terms of new cases because this one we monitored very closely.  We want to determine whether since the opening of schools there is a surge in terms of new cases. So I’ve indicated that we currently have 38 cases that we are investigating.” SABC News Mahlako Komane reports on the reopening of schools:
