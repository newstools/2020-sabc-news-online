The Educators Union of South Africa (EUSA) has called for the sacking of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. This comes after a spike in COVID-19 cases among teachers and pupils following schools reopening earlier this month. Young people in the education sector are calling for Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga to be fired. The group gathered in Pretoria marching to the Union Building to voice unhappiness with schools reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are here to demand the President remove Angie Motshekga from the responsibilities of being a Basic Education Minister urgently, people are dying in schools and she is sending more people in July. It’s going to be more grades and August more grades are going in, regardless of the fact that even water and toilets have not been delivered in schools. So we are saying we not opposed to the continuation of education but education must happen in a manner that it doesn’t endanger the lives of teachers and learners,” says Kabelo Mahlobogwane of EUSA.
