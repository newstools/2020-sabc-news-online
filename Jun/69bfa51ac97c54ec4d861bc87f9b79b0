Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize is expected to join Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane, in East London on Friday for the launch of the EMS scooters programme, aimed at assisting with tracking the coronavirus in the province. During his visit to the OR Tambo district on Thursday, Mkhize expressed concerns about the delay in tracking cases in the province.   The Eastern Cape is among the provinces with a high number of infections, with 7 868 confirmed cases. Minister Mkhize says for the country to be able to deal with COVID-19, everyone must first acknowledge that it’s not business unusual.   “The fight against COVID-19, it’s a battle for partners. We have to work together as partners and fight a common fight. Therefore, it’s important for us to clear misunderstandings now … because the future must find us strong and united, facing the really most formidable of the opponents that mankind can actually see.”   “I think we need to make that point very clear that the numbers are going to continue to grow, but our intention, we have said it’s not to actually stop the virus from spreading but it’s to reduce the rate at which it spreads,” explains the minister.
