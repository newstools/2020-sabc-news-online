The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union (BEMAWU) says it is considering interdicting the SABC over ‘what it says’ are illegal practices being conducted by management over the looming retrenchments at the public broadcaster. SABC has announced the possible retrenchment of 600 permanent staff and 1200 freelance workers. Deputy Minister for Communications Pinky Kekana has said her department is opposed to the plan. BEMAWU’s president Hannes du Buisson says the SABC management has been meeting with employees on the retrenchment process without the presence of their union representative. “They’ve decided to start consulting with staff without the involvement of trade unions which is of course illegal. People are being shown structures at this point in time and they are being shown that a decision has been taken that these people, and these people will not have jobs after this process or potentially not have jobs after this process so that is of concern.” “We are busy writing a letter to the SABC, in fact, we are at this point in time contemplating interdicting this process. They’ve got a meeting scheduled at the CCMA on the 2nd of July, so we are talking to our sister union currently at the SABC,” adds Du Buisson.
