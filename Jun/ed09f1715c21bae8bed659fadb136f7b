President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit Cape Town on Friday in an effort to assess the provincial response to the pandemic. The province is the country’s epicentre with 27 006 infections and 651 deaths reported. It accounts for nearly two-thirds of infections nationally. The visit follows oversight visits by the President to Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape to evaluate the fight against COVID-19. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde is expected to accompany Ramaphosa to inspect COVID-19 facilities. Ramaphosa will commence his visit by receiving a presentation on the Western Cape Province’s COVID-19 response strategy. He will later officially open the Hospital of Hope and also visit the Red Dot Health Staff Transport Operations. Ramaphosa’s visit to KwaZulu-Natal Last month, while visiting KwaZulu-Natal to assess the province’s readiness and response to COVID-19, Ramaphosa said South Africa is not out of the woods as yet, as the rate of the coronavirus infections is expected to rise. Ramaphosa said South Africa must brace for the worst as the rate of infection is expected to increase in the next few months and that everyone has a role to play to lessen the pace of infection. He said he is pleased with the work being done by the Kwazulu-Natal government in tracking and screening processes.
