The State Capture Commission will continue to hear evidence on Tuesday of alleged corruption and maladministration at Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa). On Monday, former board chairperson Popo Molefe explained how the administration of then president Jacob Zuma failed Prasa. Molefe says irregularities and corruption at Prasa continued to thrive despite the board doing everything in its power to report problems.
