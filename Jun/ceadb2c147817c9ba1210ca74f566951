The war in Libya has escalated and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has threatened military intervention. But this has received a strong rebuke from Tripoli. The African Union is expected to hold an urgent meeting to address the latest developments in North Africa. Since the killing of the former Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, different factions in that country have been fighting for control of this oil-rich state. The civil war rages unabated and the international community has taken sides. Now neighbouring Egypt is sending a stern warning. The country is backing the forces loyal to commander Khalif Hafter, who is fighting the internationally recognised government. “Any direct intervention from the Egyptian state has now acquired international legitimacy,” Al-Sisi told an audience after inspecting military units at an airbase near the border with Libya. The UN Secretary General’s call for a cease-fire has fallen on the deaf ears. The AU is expected to convene an urgent meeting of its Peace and Security arm. The continent has on many occasions tried to intervene without much success. AU Chairperson, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, has previously cited resolving South Sudan and Libya’s crises as his peace and security priorities. Russia and Turkey are also engaged in dialogue to broker a ceasefire in Libya.
