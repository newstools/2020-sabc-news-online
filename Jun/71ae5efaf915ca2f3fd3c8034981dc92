Eskom says it will implement load reductions throughout the weekend as a result of persistent network disruptions caused by illegal connections in the high density areas of Gauteng. The power utility says the outages will be limited to between 05:00 and 09:00 in the morning and 17:00 and 22:00 in the evening. Eskom says this is when the most damage to infrastructure occurs. In the video below, Eskom says South Africans should brace themselves for load shedding this winter:  Eskom Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the power utility has noted with concern a spike in transformer and mini-substation explosions caused by network overloading as a result of illegal connections, among other things. “These explosions lead to prolonged outages, which leave people without electricity for days and can cause fatal injuries to people. We will continue to implement the load reductions to limit damages to its electricity infrastructure and to protect its assets and the communities and we urge people of South Africa to help stop illegal activities.” On Wednesday, the power utility urged South Africans to use electricity sparingly especially in densely populated areas.

This is due to an exponential overload on the system where there are illegal connections, meter bypass, vandalism. We would like to appeal to residents to unplug or switch off because if we had to all do that we will be in position to meet high peak demand,” Eskom Spokesperson in Gauteng, Reneiloe Semenya, said.
