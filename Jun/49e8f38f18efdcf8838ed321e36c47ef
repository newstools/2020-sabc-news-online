Extramural activities service providers say they have been left in the cold as schools resume classes in South Africa. Currently COVID-19 regulations prohibit extra-mural activities in schools. Many of the school-based service providers have had to adapt to changing times and move their activities online. They say while parents have been supportive of classes moving virtually, there is no certainty on how long this will continue. In the video below, service providers lament their plight:  Those in the creative arts space have not been spared. Creative Education South Africa provides creative arts services in schools. The NPOâ€™s doors have been shut since the lockdown was announced in March. While the reopening of theatres has since been announced, the limitations are forcing the organisation to realign its offerings. Other service providers are meanwhile waiting to see if the current level 3 regulations will permit the resumption of extramural activities.
