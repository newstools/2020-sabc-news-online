Winde says this comes after writing to President Cyril Ramaphosa and engaging Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. The Western Cape has 38 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Alan Winde outlines the Western Cape’s targeted COVID-19 hotspot strategy:  Winde says the focus has been put on reducing the backlog from over 27 000 to around 3 700. “We still have our newly adjusted policy in place where we are focusing the testing on hospitals, specifically the frontline workers and patients in hospitals, as well as vulnerable people in society. Hopefully, in the next few days, we’ll be able to also reassess that if we can see these backlog remains where it is. Once again, I really welcome this.”  Western Cape likely to hit 100 000 COVID-19 infections Winde said last week that the province is likely to hit the 100 000 mark of COVID-19 infections in the coming weeks. This as the province accounts for well over 60% of the national infection rate, with a significant number of people still in hospitals. “We know that next week the number will be double to what they are this week. Every eight days, the numbers are doubling. We had 80 000, which was the projection and will probably go up to 120 000 because we have re-assessed our models. But we probably have one of the most robust public health systems in the province,” Winde said during an interview with Motsweding FM’s Current Affairs Show.
