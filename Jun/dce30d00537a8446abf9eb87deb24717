The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday reported a total of 1 802,470 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 14 790 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 761 to 105 157. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as COVID-19, caused by a new coronavirus, as of 4p.m. ET on June 1, versus its previous report released on Monday. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Meanwhile, a senior US Army vaccine researcher said on Tuesday it was reasonable to expect that some sort of coronavirus vaccine could be available to part of the US population by the end of the year. Defense Secretary Mark Esper vowed on May 15 that the US military and other parts of the government would, in collaboration with the private sector, produce a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and partners abroad by year-end. Colonel Wendy Sammons-Jackson, director of the US Military Infectious Disease Research Program, told a Pentagon news briefing it was “reasonable to expect that there will be some form of a vaccine that could be available at some level, to a certain population, by the end of the year.” Another Army researcher, Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, said researchers were learning about the new virus “faster than we have about any other virus before.”
