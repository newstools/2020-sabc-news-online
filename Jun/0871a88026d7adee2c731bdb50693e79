President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in Parliament this week to answer oral questions from members of the National Assembly for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The annual oral session will be conducted through virtual proceedings, with some of the 400 members of the house being present in the chamber and others participating from their homes.  On Wednesday, the house will also hold a debate as part of the Youth Day celebrations. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the National Council of Provinces will hold its plenary session too. He says about 16 virtual meetings of various committees are also expected to sit throughout the week. Mothapo says, “Parliament will this week hold a debate on Youth Day. It will also conduct oral questions to Ramaphosa by members of the National Assembly. And also there will be plenary sittings of the national council of provinces, and about 16 virtual sittings of committees are scheduled this week.” “It will be for the first time that parliament conducts oral questions to the President on a hybrid platform where members will be connecting in the platforms from their homes, whilst others will be in the chamber in Cape Town,” added Mothapo.
