The Western Cape Department of Health has urged members of the public who are unable to self-isolate due to economic or social reasons to make use of its various isolation and quarantine facilities across the province. The Department says it currently has around 1200 beds available for people to isolate themselves or go into quarantine if they test positive for COVID-19. Speaking during Premier Alan Winde’s weekly COVID-19 digital media briefing, Provincial Health Minister, Nomafrench Mbombo, says the quarantine and isolation bed spaces are under-utilised at this stage. “We encourage people, especially during this time, under the weather and the bad conditions in an environment where you can’t even be able to self-isolate because of the weather conditions, please make use of those. It’s part of strengthening the whole health system.”   Head of the Western Cape Health Department, Dr Keith Cloete, says the coronavirus pandemic hit Cape Town much earlier.
