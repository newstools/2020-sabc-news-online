Tshegofatso Pule, the 28-year-old who was found on Monday hanging from a tree in Roodepoort, on Gauteng’s West Rand, will be laid to rest on Thursday. Pule had been stabbed and killed after she went missing last week. Pule, who was eight months pregnant, had been stabbed in the chest. The expectant mother from Soweto reportedly went to visit her boyfriend in Florida last week but never returned. Her death has caused outrage, with many calling for justice. At Pule’s candlelight memorial in Soweto on Wednesday, a few shared their words.  “Thank you for being a friend, sharing your life with me. I will always love you and your unborn angel,” says a friend. “Well, come forward, say something. We are at a time when we are really tired of men that are just sitting and doing nothing about our situation so we are really tired. As a man, stand up and come fight for the women of SA,” says a mourner. “We were looking forward to receiving the new member of the family but it was never meant to be so,” adds another mourner.
