The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume on Monday after proceedings were halted due to the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. Hearings began in August 2018 and looked into various allegations. It also heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including former BOSASA COO, Angelo Agrizzi and a short appearance by former President Jacob Zuma. Proceedings on Monday will focus on allegations of corruption in relation to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) and will hear testimony from former PRASA board chairperson, Popo Molefe amongst others. Earlier in June, Chairperson of the inquiry Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, stated that the application to get Zuma to testify before the Commission is before the courts. He said the lockdown has effectively stalled the process to force Zuma to testify. Zondo added that the lockdown has also set back plans for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appear before the Commission. “I had planned that President Ramaphosa would be asked to come to the Commission around July, that was before the national lockdown happened. [The] lockdown has forced us to rearrange things … so it’s going to take some time before he appears,” says Zondo.
