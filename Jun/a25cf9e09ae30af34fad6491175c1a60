Johannesburg’s City Power is warning of unplanned power outages moving into the weekend due to increased demand for electricity as temperatures continue to drop.   By 11am on Friday, City Power technicians were already attending to close to 300 unplanned outages. The power utility has appealed to residents to use power sparingly. ” Our system is under pressure due to the cold front. Residents are also urged to report illegal connections which exacerbate this problem of infrastructure failure and unplanned outages. Continue to log the calls and we are not load-shedding. Any outages that are happening please log a call so that we can send technicians,” says City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena.
