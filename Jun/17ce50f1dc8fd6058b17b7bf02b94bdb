KwaZulu- Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu says the three schools that have been temporarily closed in the province due to teachers who tested positive for COVID-19 are being decontaminated and will reopen soon. Apollo Secondary School in Chatsworth, Clairwood Secondary and Savannah Park Secondary schools closed a few days after they reopened due to positive cases of COVID-19. “The first two days have been really proceeding fairly well in the province, we are quite happy that a number of schools are reporting no glitches across the province. We have closed a few schools and we have allowed the department of health to take over in terms of testing the educators and also disinfecting schools,” says Mshengu. Mshengu says the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) have been deployed to assist to close schools that have not yet opened due to water access challenges. On Wednesday morning, Mshengu will be inspecting scholar transport processes at Umbumbulu on the province’s south coast.  In Pretoria, the High Court is expected to rule on the urgency of an application brought by Educators Union of South Africa (Eusa) which is challenging the decision to reopen schools across the republic. The union wants the court to set aside the reopening of schools by the Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, arguing that the threat posed by COVID-19 is great and returning to school poses a greater threat to learners and educators. The union objects to schools reopening in the video below :
