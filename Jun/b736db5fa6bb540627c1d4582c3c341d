The National Commissioner of the South African Police Service Khehla Sitole will on Thursday visit a game farm outside Marble Hall in Limpopo following the discovery of a multi-million-rand drug lab. Two foreign nationals have been arrested for dealing in drugs and being in possession of unlicensed firearms. Police say that they have launched a manhunt for an unknown number of suspects. The private game farm is situated in a quiet farming area outside Marble Hall. The owners of the farm purchased the farm a few months ago in a multi-million rand cash exchange. Police conducted a raid on Wednesday where drug manufacturing equipment was discovered. #sapsHQ #MediaAlert: #SAPSNPC, General #Sitole to visit the scene of a huge clandestine drug lab in Marble Hall, Limpopo on Thu, 18/06 at 08:00 Pieon Game farm situated in Terra Nostra farm outside Marble Hall.
