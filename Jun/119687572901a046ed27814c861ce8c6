Eastern Cape Premier, Oscar Mabuyane, says contracts worth over R220 million have been awarded to local contractors to help refurbish 34 health facilities across the province. He was speaking during a media briefing on the province’s efforts to fight the coronavirus (COVID-19). Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, says people need to prepare for a spike in coronavirus numbers in Gauteng, the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. South Africa has recorded over 144 000 coronavirus cases – of which 70 000 have recovered and 2 529 people have died from the virus. Mabuyane says hundreds of healthcare workers have been recruited to assist those infected with the virus. “We have recruited an additional 1000 nurses and over 5000 community health workers in the province. We have awarded 42 contracts worth R222.8 million to Eastern Cape based contractors for refurbishment of 34 health facilities across the province for COVID-19.” “These projects are for the various stages of implementation, with 20 projects having already been completed, 12 planned to be completed by the end of July and the remaining 10 projects are earmarked for the end of August 2020,” explains Mabuyane.
