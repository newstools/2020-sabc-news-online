In March 2020, the South African National AIDS Council (Sanac) raised concerns about hate crimes against the LGBTIQ+ community. The statement by Sanac was sparked by the death of a 23-year-old musician Lindokuhle Cele who was also stabbed to death. Fans and friends on social media platforms have paid tribute to the dancer.
