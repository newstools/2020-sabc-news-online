South Africa’s total coronavirus confirmed cases at 40 792 on Thursday, Health ministry says. It has reported 56 more COVID-19 related deaths with Western Cape accounting for 54 of the deaths – there is one more death in KwaZulu-Natal and one in the Free State. This brings the total number of national deaths to 848. 3 267 new cases were recorded from the previous day. The recoveries jump to 21 311 in the past 24 hours, with a recovery rate of 52,24%. So far 820 675 tests have been conducted. “We extend our condolences to the loved ones of the departed and thank the healthcare workers who treated the deceased,” says the Department in a statement.   President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to visit Cape Town on Friday to assess the Western Cape’s provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Western Cape currently accounts for nearly two-thirds of infections nationally. President Ramaphosa will be accompanied by Western Cape Premier Alan Winde on his inspection of COVID-19 facilities in the province. The Western Cape Government recently announced that it would only test people who are at highest risk and the most vulnerable of dying from COVID-19 infections in the Cape Town Metropole. Premier Winde says this will allow them to get test results back faster and will also ensure speedy interventions. He says the backlog of tests from the province at the National Health Laboratory Service currently stands at 27 000. 820 675 40 792 21 311  18 633  848 22 159 34 696  (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
