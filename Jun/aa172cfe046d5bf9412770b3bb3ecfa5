The City of Cape Town’s Disaster and Risk Management says all services are on standby this weekend to deal with adverse weather conditions expected to make landfall on Saturday.  The SA Weather Service has issued a warning of severe cold weather, gale force winds, rain and rough seas. Spokesperson for Disaster Management Charlotte Powel says residents must be vigilant. “We remind residents to please clear out any potential blockages around their homes and ensure that gutters and downpipes are clean. In low lying areas please dig a trench around your home if possible to allow water to run off and reduce the risk of localised flooding,” says Powel.
