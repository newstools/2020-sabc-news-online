The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says investigations are continuing into an alleged fraudulent transfer of funds relating to the UIF COVID-19 relief fund. The NPA says it has secured a preservation order at the High Court in Gauteng for more than R3.2-million, which was part of R5.7-million, allocated to CSG Resourcing in order to pay employees. It is alleged that Tshepang Phohole and other CSG employees received a share of the cash. NPA spokesperson Sipho Ngwema says the money is being preserved by the court. “The assets forfeiture unit was granted a preservation order for R3.2-million in relation to money that was sent by UIF allegedly fraudulently into a bank account of Tshepang Phohole. The money was meant for service provider CSG Resourcing which is a client services company that pays a number of its clients. So the money went into that account and it was distributed into a number of accounts fraudulently. The assets forfeiture unit and state agencies quickly froze the money and now the money has been preserved by the court.” In the video below, understanding the UIF temporary relief scheme:
