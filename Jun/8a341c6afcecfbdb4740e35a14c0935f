The offices of the Ulundi Local Municipality in northern KwaZulu-Natal have been temporarily shut down after several employees tested positive for the coronavirus. More than 40 councillors and 350 employees have been tested. Municipality Spokesperson Nkosenye Zulu says they decided to temporarily close the offices as a precautionary measure on the advice of the Health Department. “About 98% of the results have been returned. Sadly, there are positive cases, although at this junction I am not in a position to disclose the number and further details pending a meeting with the Department of Health, which will also give us direction with regards to the health protocols going forward, to avoid further transmissions. At least until we are advised, (and) we are given marching orders by the Department of Health, all urgent emergencies, as well as essential services, will continue unhindered.” Currently, there are 97 302 with 1 930 deaths in South Africa. KwaZulu-Natal accounts for 5.2% percent of the total number of cases, which amounts to a total of 5030 cases. South Africa’s mortality stands at 1.8%. The number of recoveries is 51 608, which translates to a recovery rate of 53%.
