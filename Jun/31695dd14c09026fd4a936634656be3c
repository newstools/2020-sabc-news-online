Eastern Cape premier, Oscar Mabuyane has tested negative for the coronavirus. This after fears that he might have contracted the virus as one of his core-staff members tested positive. Mabuyane had been in self-isolation for over a week. He announced his results during a sitting of the provincial legislature. “I’ve since received my negative results and that ends my self-quarantine as the premier. This virus is not a death sentence. It can be defeated and it will be defeated, honourable chair and members. We would also like to call on our communities to be extra cautious during alert Level 3 as the virus is still there,” says Mabuyane. The Eastern Cape has been seeing a rise in COVID-19 infections. The Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces now account for 78% of all positive cases. 785 979 37 525 19 682  17 051  792 20 474 24 445  (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Meanwhile, Mabuyane has announced that his office in partnership with national government will facilitate the repatriation of the remains of Sibusiso Qongqo from Cuba.

Mabuyane has made the announcement during a sitting in the provincial legislature. “We are working with Dirco, as well as Defense, that his remains be brought back home on the 2nd of July. On the 29th (June) there’s a flight that will be going to Cuba from SANDF to bring back home those who are finishing their programs there and as well as the mortal remains of Sibusiso Qongqo.”
