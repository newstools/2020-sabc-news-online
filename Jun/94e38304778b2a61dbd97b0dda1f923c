KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, says he is deeply concerned over taxi violence in the province, coupled with taxi organisations’ decision to fill up taxis to capacity from Monday despite lockdown restrictions. The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) and the National Taxi Alliance (NTA) announced on Sunday, that they will be loading at a 100 percent and resume inter-provincial travel from Monday morning. In the video below, Santaco briefs the media:  Last week, a taxi driver was killed in a drive by shooting, and three teachers, who were being ferried to work, were seriously injured. “On one hand you have a business that is collapsing people losing jobs on another hand you’ve got people losing lives and we have said that in this week alone people who lost lives are about 28. That is not a little number. We must be concerned, so trying to mitigate and find each other will be important. MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Bheki Ntuli is dealing with the matter,” explains Zikalala. In the video below, Santaco says all taxis will load 100% as from Monday:  Transport Ministry expresses disappointment at SANTACO’s utterances: Ayanda-Allie Paine The Transport Ministry says that the meeting between the department and the Taxi association will still take place next week as earlier reported. However, the department has expressed disappointment at Santaco’s utterances that its members will load one hundred percent capacity as from Monday.
