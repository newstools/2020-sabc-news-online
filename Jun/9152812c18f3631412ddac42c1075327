The Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban has refuted messages on social media that the hospital will be closing down and that patients will be transferred to other hospitals. According to social media claims, six doctors and six nurses have contracted COVID-19 from patients. The Netcare Group says there is no truth to a WhatsApp message about another COVID-19 outbreak at St. Augustine’s Hospital in Durban. The hospital’s General Manager Heinrich Venter says, in a statement, spreading such fake news will cause unnecessary concern and anxiety among the public and the relatives of people who are in the hospital. In April, St Augustine’s Hospital had to shut down for sanitisation after 66 people, including 47 staff members, tested positive for the virus. Four people died.
