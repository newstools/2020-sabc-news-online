Nedbank has confirmed that three of its staff members at its Newtown Junction Offices in Johannesburg have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). In a statement, Nedbank says as soon as they became aware of the cases they followed protocol and deep cleaned the affected areas to limit exposure to other employees. However, some staff members at the Nedbank Junction Precinct allege that after it was confirmed that three employees had contracted the virus, no immediate action was taken by the bank, therefore endangering their lives. The sources claim that in the same affected floor some employees were immediately advised to vacate their posts. They also claim that one of the line managers responsible for the bank’s collections department allegedly told his staff that “he employed adults and they must take responsibility, if they are not at work they will be laid off”. Nedbank has, however, refuted the claims saying they followed all due processes and direct contacts of the confirmed cases were advised to self-isolate.
