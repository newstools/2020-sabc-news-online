The SA Weather Service says a cold day can be expected today in parts of Gauteng and rain is also expected in parts of the province. Many other provinces will experience icy temperatures as another cold front sweeps over the interior.  Forecaster Lehlohonolo Thobela says freezing rain can also be expected in parts of Mpumalanga, North West and the Free State: “There are high probabilities of rainfall in the province together with scattered showers in the southern parts of Gauteng. There will be isolated showers in the North West, south western parts of Mpumalanga and northern Free State. But in terms of snow, it’s hard to say right now because the temperature does not agree to it. But instead of snow we are expecting freezing rain.” Meanwhile, Eskom has warned that the national grid is under severe strain and has urged people to switch off geysers, unnecessary lights and all non essential appliances. The power utility has been able to avoid load shedding as the country went into lockdown and businesses closed. However, many people have now returned to work and the cold weather means many people are using heaters to try and stay warm. There have been protests in some areas where Eskom has cut, or restricted power to communities that have not been paying for electricity.
