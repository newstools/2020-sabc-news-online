Senegalese President Macky Sall is quarantining for two weeks after coming into contact with someone who has since tested positive for the coronavirus, state television said on Thursday. The measure is precautionary as an initial COVID-19 test of Sall has come back negative, it said. Senegal’s handling of the pandemic While Senegal’s government has not faced major opposition to its handling of the pandemic, protests broke out earlier this month in the capital Dakar against some imposed restrictions. Government subsequently relaxed a dawn-to-dusk curfew and lifted a ban on inter-regional travel. The country currently sits at 6 129 cases, with 4 072 recoveries and 93 deaths.
