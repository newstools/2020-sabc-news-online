Zimbabwe’s Health Minister has been released from custody after being granted 50-thousand Zimbabwean Dollars bail by a Harare Magistrate. Obadiah Moyo faces three counts of criminal abuse of office in relation to the awarding of tenders. Moyo allegedly awarded Delish Nguwaya, Swiss company Drax’s representative in Zimbabwe, two illegal contracts in 2019 and 2020. In the video below, further details on Moyo being granted bail:  The tenders relate to supplying of medical sundries as well as providing COVID-19 testing kits and personal protection equipment. Drax International is allegedly not even a pharmaceutical organisation but a consultancy firm which was only registered this year. It’s believed that Moyo awarded the mega-contract without following the proper procedures after Drax’s bid was rejected by Treasury. Initial investigations reveal that Drax hyper-inflated prices – a mask that cost 28-dollars was marked up at 98 dollars. The contract has since been rescinded by the government.
