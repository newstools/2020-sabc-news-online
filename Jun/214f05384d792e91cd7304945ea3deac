The Union for Democratisation of the Workplace (UDT) that represents workers in the cash-in-transit industry has called on companies transporting money to close their cash centres. The union says dozens of its members have tested positive for COVID-19, but their companies are doing nothing to assist. The union says these companies are hiding information about the staff members that have tested positive. It says even after these companies discover that there are cases, they still allow other employees to continue working. UDT representative, Hlasinyane Motaung has urged the Department of Health to intervene before people lose their lives. “We wrote a letter to them citing our dissatisfaction with the method that they were using, only of screening the employees. We asked them that they could now and then use the testing itself and they never did that. We went over even to the Labour Department and to report this matter. G4S, Fidelity and SBV, most of their branches, they’ve got corona cases and most of them are sweeping them under the carpet.” South Africa’s number of coronavirus cases hit 101 590 cases on Monday with a jump of 4 288 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours. Close to 2 000 COVID-19 related deaths have been recorded.
