The African National Congress (ANC) has declared this Friday as Black Friday to mark the killing of George Floyd by police in the US town of Minneapolis more than a week ago. The death has sparked widespread protests in America and solidarity protests across the world. The first of a series of memorials for Floyd was held in Minneapolis on Thursday. Addressing the media via video link, ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said: “The alliance starting on Friday, the 5th of June 2020 at 19h00, through an event to be addressed by the ANC President [Cyril Ramaphosa]…. will launch its [their] campaign of solidarity with the people of the US. It will start our own Black Friday where henceforth we are called upon to wear black on Friday for the next three weeks.” In the video below, ANC and its Alliance partners Cosatu, SACP brief media on their upcoming campaign against racism:    Meanwhile, civil rights leader, Reverend Al Sharpton, led the eulogy at the first memorial service to remember and honour the life of Floyd in Minneapolis in the United States on Thursday.
