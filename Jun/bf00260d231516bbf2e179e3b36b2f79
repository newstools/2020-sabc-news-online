Former employees of Raubex Infra in Leeudoringstad, near Wolmaranstad, in the North West are concerned about unfair labour practices. Workers say they were dismissed from work without proper procedures following the COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year. The workers have since been sitting at home waiting for their outstanding benefits. The company started building a solar plant in the area two-years-ago. Once complete it will supply electricity to existing power stations in Leeudoringstad, Wolmaranstad and Klerksdorp. The workers are unhappy about the alleged unfairly dismissal by their employer despite the call by government not to retrench workers during the national lockdown. Over 200 employees lost their jobs. One of the leaders of the workers,  Zaza Keagilenyana explains, “They supposed to pay us the productivity bonuses and the outstanding amount of the money. They supposed to pay us but they did not pay. Some of our grievances they admit to it, some of it they put them on hold for a certain period of time, so we do not know how long it’s going to take.” Some former employees say they have not been paid all that’s due to them. They are demanding that their outstanding allowances be paid. “The company terminated out contracts due to COVID-19 without my concern. So, they have signed for me while I was not on duty saying it’s a must.” “I am from maternity leave for four months. I did not get paid. When asking our HR Manager about the maternity form, he does not have any answers but says the company will not pay us for the maternity leave.” Raubex Infra has declined to comment on the matter.
