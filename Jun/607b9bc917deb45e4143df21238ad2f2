China reported 11 new COVID-19 cases and seven asymptomatic cases for June 12, the national health authority said on Saturday. The National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement that five of the new confirmed patients were so-called imported cases involving travellers from overseas. The six locally transmitted cases were all in Beijing, the statement said. The NHC reported seven confirmed cases and one asymptomatic case a day earlier. The total number of COVID-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 83 075, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4 634. China does not count asymptomatic patients, who are infected withÂ the virus but do not display symptoms, as confirmed cases.
