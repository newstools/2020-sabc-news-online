Angry Soshanguve taxi operators have vowed to intensify their protest until government meets their demands. Many commuters were left stranded as taxi operators pulled their handbrakes on Monday. They are demanding that government increase the relief support to R5 billion. The government has indicated it cannot afford the taxi industry’s demand for the state to increase its support. Soshanguve taxi operators have accused Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula of not listening to their demands. In the video below, taxi operators express their dissatisfaction with the minister:  This comes after Mbalula left during a meeting with taxi operators in the area after he was shouted at by angry operators. He has called on taxi owners to stop fighting government and instead re-enter negotiations to fix the industry so that it can survive in a post-COVID world. The minister has once again urged taxi operators to accept what the government has put on the table. “The decision to avail R1,135 billion to the taxi industry as relief support was not an easy one. We literally had to scrape the bottom of the barrel to reach this amount. We believe the taxi industry is deserving of support as the largest mover of our people,” says the minister.
