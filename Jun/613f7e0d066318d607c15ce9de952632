Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will brief the media on Wednesday afternoon on the work the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has been doing during the lockdown period. The commission postponed until further notice testimony that was expected to have been heard during the lockdown period. At the time of the commission’s adjournment, testimony from a number of Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) officials including former board chairperson, Popo Molefe, was being heard. During his evidence, Molefe told the commission that Daniel Mthimkhulu, the fake engineer who fabricated his CV, never produced evidence of his qualification to Prasa’s Human Resources when he was hired in 2010. He says Mthimkhulu lied his way to the top of the organisation to become head engineer and was only able to produce fake letters when asked to provide proof of his qualifications. Molefe was giving testimony regarding the procurement of 88 locomotives’ for Prasa. The former Prasa board chair says the procurement process for those trains was manipulated by former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana and his associates. Justice system still operational during lockdown The wheels of justice have continued to turn during the national lockdown, according to the Department of Justice and Correctional Services officials who appeared before parliamentarians late last month. They said evidence leaders and officials for the commission had been hard at work behind closed doors during the last two months working on key parts of evidence presented by witnesses. Prior to the lockdown, the Zondo Commission had been granted a final extension to complete its work investigating state capture up until March next year. The afternoon’s briefing, may shed light on whether additional time will now be required. In the video below, former Prasa board chairperson, Popo Molefe concludes his testimony:
