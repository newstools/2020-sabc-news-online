Africa is home to nine out the ten most neglected displacement crises in the world according to refugees rights group, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burkina Faso are the most neglected displacement crises in the world. The council warns that humanitarian crises in these countries are expected to worsen this year, compounded by the global coronavirus pandemic. For a second year running, Cameroon topped the list as the most neglected crisis in 2019. Cameroon is faced with an increase in Boko Haram attacks in the north, a violent conflict in the English-speaking west, and a Central African refugee crisis. It is followed by DR Congo, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Venezuela, Mali, South Sudan, Nigeria, Central African Republic and Niger. The countries in the Sahel region featured prominently in the list following a rise in extremist violence and an underfunded humanitarian aid appeal. The NRCâ€™s neglected crisis list is based on review of over 40 displacement crises based on lack of funding, lack of media attention, and political and diplomatic neglect.
