The South African Police Services (SAPS) in the Eastern Cape has condemned a gruesome killing after an elderly couple from King Williams Town was discovered murder at their homestead. The couple was discovered by a neighbour who realised had not seen the couple come out and went into their home through a broken window only to find them dead. The deceased couple, a 91-year-old man and an 85-year-old woman were staying at their homestead with their 22-year-old granddaughter from their adoptive deceased daughter. The couple’s bodies were discovered with stab wounds on the upper body. According to a statement from the Provincial Commissioner, the community became suspicious when they couldn’t see the couple’s granddaughter at that time. “A search was conducted and her body was later found hanging on a tree with a rope tied to her neck. Bloodstains were visible on her clothes and shoes,” reads the statement in part. Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant colonel Liziwe Ntshinga has strongly condemned the senseless murders. “Nobody deserves to die in such a painful way, especially our elderly vulnerable people. Communities should unite and work together with the police and eradicate any forms of criminality in their communities.” Meanwhile, one suspect has been arrested in connection with the murder of a woman whose body was found in a veld in Dobsonville, Soweto on Friday. The community found the woman’s body, which had wounds to the upper body, under a tree.
