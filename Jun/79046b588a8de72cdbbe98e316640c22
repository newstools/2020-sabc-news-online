Limpopo has recorded its fourth COVID-19 related fatality. Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba says the person died in Polokwane.

She says, “There is no death that is COVID that has happened in Modimolle or Waterberg at all, we do have case number four that has happened, that has happened in Capricorn district, if I am not mistaken it is a 54- year-old who has a history of visiting Pretoria somewhere around May.” Musina records its first coronavirus case On Thursday, Musina in Limpopo, which borders Zimbabwe  recorded its first coronavirus case. A truck driver travelling from Johannesburg to Zimbabwe tested positive for COVID-19. Health Spokesperson, Neil Shikwambana says the man was tested for coronavirus at a local hospital and released pending the results.
