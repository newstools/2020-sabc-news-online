The Men’s sector of Takuwane Re eme Movement says more needs to be done to enhance the behaviour of South African men and boys in combating the scourge of gender-based violence. There has been a rise in gender-based violence cases since alert Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown began on June 1. Doctor Matome Kganakga, National Deputy Chairperson of the Men’s sector of Takuwane Re eme Movement says, “The reality is that when you talk about the deterrence of crime it starts in behavioural changes within communities. When it comes to the criminal justice system, we are doing extremely horribly in terms of if you look at the rate of prosecution, it’s literally at less than one percent.” He adds: “We can’t be a society that has accepted that we have failed with such a fundamental principle and it’s something that I want to emphasis that we cannot build and prepare for gender-based violence. We must deal with the basics in ensuring that how we socialise men and boys is ultimately different and we deal with issues that build the culture of violence as well as rape.” In the audio below,  This past week, Tshegofatso Pule, Naledi Phangindawo, Nompumelelo Tshaka and other women in the Eastern Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal were found murdered.
