The Gauteng Department of Education has assured parents that the online application system is efficient after some parents experienced glitches when applying for their children to be placed at schools for next year.     On Thursday, on the first day of opening the application system, the department received over 140 000 applications for grades 1 and grade 8 for the 2021 academic year. However, some parents experienced a delay after a new security feature added the identity verification feature. Parents also allegedly received SMS messages with blank reference numbers. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “We did experience some glitches. When you deal with a high volume of numbers, people who want to access the system at a go, you’re prone to have some of these glitches. Thirty minutes down the line, we resolved most of those glitches and the system was picking up and managed to record over 140 000 successful applications.” In the video below, Steve Mabona gives an update on the Gauteng online schools applications for 2021:
