The United Nations (UN) and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement have jointly called for unity in scaling up efforts to develop, test and scale-up production of safe, effective and affordable treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19.

They also call for a people’s vaccine that protects both affluent cities and rural communities, the old in care homes and young people in refugee camps.

President Cyril Ramaphosa indicated earlier, that a COVID-19 vaccine must be patent free, rapidly made and distributed and free for all, calling for all the science to be shared between governments. The two groups also warned that the commitment towards the current pandemic should be accompanied by an equal global collaboration to sustain immunizations against other preventable diseases.
