Deputy President David Mabuza will visit the Free State on Friday as part of the decision taken by the National Coronavirus Command Council for the President and his deputy to visit all provinces to assess their state of readiness in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Other areas of focus will be the state of readiness of provincial health infrastructure in responding to the coronavirus pandemic and the extent of the reach of economic and social coronavirus relief measures to those that these interventions are intended for. The Free State visit is a continuation of the work of government to flatten the curve and save lives. Mabuza visits Mangaung which is the epicentre of the coronavirus infections in the Free State province. He will be joined by Premier Sisi Ntombela and they will visit the provincial Health Command Centre, the Universitas Hospital that has been designated as the provincial centre for isolation and treatment of people infected with coronavirus, as well as address newly recruited nurses and social workers employed to support the implementing of the provincial coronavirus response plan. Unemployed nurses Unemployed professional nurse Molefi Moshane is part of a group of unemployed nurses who are hopeful that Mabuza will come up with strategies for the provincial department of health to hire them. Moshane says, “Our Health Department says they are looking for nurses while they do have nurses who completed community services last year, they still have information for nurses. If they are looking for nurses why are they not looking in the database, instead of saying people must go to Bophelo house. We find it amusing that they are looking for nurses, but there are no people who went for interviews.” In the video below, Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela outlines the Free State’s readiness to move from lockdown Level 4 to 3:  820 675 40 792 21 311  18 633  848 22 159 34 696  (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
