Reports from the Malawian border with Mozambique, say over nine buses ferrying Malawian repatriates from South Africa, has crossed the Mozambique side of the border into Malawi, but are now stranded in no-manâ€™s land. Authorities on the Malawi side have apparently not given the go-ahead and clarity, whether the repatriates should be let free to join their families or get tested and quarantined first. The Malawian government had sent four buses to South Africa to evacuate stranded Malawian nationals because of the lockdown. The move was in response to an outcry from many Malawians living in South Africa who have been suffering since the country started a lockdown in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Reports state that several of these people escaped from the quarantine site. In the video below, Malawi journalist Daniel Mababa, who has been following this story for some time now, joins SABC News via Skype from Lilongwe.
