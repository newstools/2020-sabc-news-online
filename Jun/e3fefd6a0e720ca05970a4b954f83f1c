The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Eastern Cape says the provincial government must be forced to close schools as they have lost control of the COVID-19 crisis. This comes after more than 200 learners at Makaula Senior Secondary School at KwaBhaca tested positive for the coronavirus. EFF provincial chairperson, Yazini Tetyana says lives must be prioritised over education. “We are calling on government to close the schools. Schools are not ready. We have reports already that are saying from the day schools reopened, we had COVID-19 positive cases. We are not in control of the virus, there’s just no rush to open schools. Life is more important. We have a duty as a nation to preserve humanity,” explains Tetyana.
