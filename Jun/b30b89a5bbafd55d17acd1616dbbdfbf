The North West Health Department says it is considering writing a letter of motivation to the national department to have the Rustenburg and Matlosana municipalities revert to level five of the lockdown. The two municipalities in the province have recorded the highest number of COVID-19 infections, Rustenburg has 333 cases while Matlosana municipality has 165 of the province’s 604 infections. North West Health MEC Madoda Sambatha says, “The two have contributed 222 cases in just two days. This growth is directly their contribution and if this growth is not properly managed, in July they are going to have delivered to the province more than 1000 new cases.” While the Rustenburg in the North West was not willing to comment on the health department’s plan, saying they will only do so once such a decision has been communicated to them by the Provincial Command Council. The Executive Mayor of the City of Matlosana Local Municipality, Maetu Kgaile says they can only support moving back to level four. Kgaile says she acknowledges the negative impact this will have on the local economy, but says it is for the benefit of the people. Kgaile says, “We support the Mec’s proposal for taking Matlosana back to level four, because the number of people who are infected has increased rapidly and also the people are adhering to social distancing and other regulations…” “We therefore request the Mec to increase the law enforcement in Matlosana in order to safeguard the lives of our people. As the city, we’ll wait and be guided by the provincial command council,” added Kgaile. Story by Keadimilwe Moalusi
