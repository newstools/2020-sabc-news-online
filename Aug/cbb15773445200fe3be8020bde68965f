According to the Health Department, 57 of the deaths are from Eastern Cape, 136 from Gauteng, 76 from KwaZulu Natal, 29 from Western Cape and 7 from Northern Cape.

It is comforting that as of this week, the recoveries in Gauteng are at 70%. There was a period between June and July were the active cases were at 65%. And now the number of active cases is at 29%.” Makhura says that while this is good news, the worst is far from over. He says the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the province is in densely-populated Soweto.
