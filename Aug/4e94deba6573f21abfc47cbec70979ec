A senior member of Lebanon’s negotiating team with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has resigned, becoming the third to do so over deadlocked talks, a source close to the finance ministry told Reuters on Sunday. Talal Salman was economic advisor to the Lebanese finance ministry. A ministry spokeswoman declined to comment. Lebanon began talks with the IMF for a bailout in May after defaulting on its huge sovereign debt but the negotiations were put on hold in July due to a lack of action on reforms and a row on the Lebanese side over the size of its vast financial losses. The government that launched the talks resigned this month over the August 4 port explosion in Beirut that fuelled public anger at a political class seen as responsible for the country’s many woes, including a deep financial crisis rooted in corruption and mismanagement.
