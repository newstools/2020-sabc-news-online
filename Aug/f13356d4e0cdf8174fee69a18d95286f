A legal expert with the Limpopo Society of Advocates, Sidwell Sikhwari says the ruling by the High Court in Pretoria setting aside some of the findings against an African National Congress (ANC) treasurer, Danny Msiza, in the Reserve Bank report, Great Bank Heist, is not an exoneration. Msiza was suspected to be a kingpin who coerced the municipalities to invest funds in the VBS bank. Sikhwari says court documents filed by Advocate Terry Motau which did not allow Msiza a right of response means the allegations against him could still be challenged. “It is not necessarily an exoneration. He was not given a fair chance to recite or to comment on the adverse findings which were made against him. The court was not happy with the manner in which when adverse allegations were made against him he was not allowed to respond.” “As it stands now, we don’t know whether the allegations are true or they are not true. When we look at the report of Advocate Terry Motau as filed in court, it does not explain why he was not given an opportunity.” Msiza and the former Vhembe Executive Mayor Florence Radzilani were ordered to step aside by the ANC Integrity Committee following the report in 2018. However, last month, the ANC resolved to reinstate them amid an outcry from various quarters. The video below is reporting about Msiza and Radzilani’s reinstatement:
