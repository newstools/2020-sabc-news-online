The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to deal with, what they call, current ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule’s web of capture in the province. The party says it is not shocked by the latest revelations that Magashule’s sons have clinched COVID-19 contracts. It is reported that the names of Motheko Projects and Marvel Deeds appear on the list of companies that secured contracts from the Free State treasury and that Magushule`s sons are listed as directors of the two companies. Free State DA Chief Whip, David van Vuuren says the party will ask the MEC to provide the report on the procurement processes. “It is unacceptable that the former premier uses his powers and influence to benefit out of these contracts. We going to put pressure on the ANC to investigate this matter, unfortunately it is evident that Magashule is still in control in the Free State and that his tentacles are deeply entrenched in the finances in the Free State. We also going to ask President Cyril Ramaphosa to investigate this matter and it are now time that he stands up and show that he has backbone to stand up against Ace Magashule.” The Free State Finance Department says it will ensure that consequence management will be effected where proper procedures were not followed. According to the department, the MEC of finance, Gadija Brown, has requested an audit on COVID-19 procurement. Magashule’s sons could not be reached for comment.
