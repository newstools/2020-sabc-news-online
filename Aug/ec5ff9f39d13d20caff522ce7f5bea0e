Zimbabwe’s High Court has dismissed investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono’s appeal for bail. The journalist was arrested last month and charged with inciting public violence. The charges are related to Chin’ono promoting anti-corruption demonstrations that were set for last week Friday. Harare has since conducted a brutal crackdown on dissent. Chin’ono was denied bail in the Magistrate Court last month after it found that he was a flight risk and could possibly continue to incite violence.  He then turned to the High Court seeking relief. Defence lawyers argued that the journalist would not pose any risk to society and should be released on bail. The High Court delivered the judgment without any reasons for the decision. Meanwhile, opposition politician, Jacob Ngarivhume, who was arrested on the same day as Chin’ono and faces the same charges, will know his fate on Friday when the High Court delivers judgment in his appeal. There are growing calls for action against the arrests of journalists and activists:  Zimbabwe government denies violating human rights Zimbabwe government has denied it’s violated human rights. It’s described recent allegations as misinformation, peddled by political individuals and global actors.  Last month, security forces cracked down on anti-corruption activists participating in demonstrations. At least half a dozen people were arrested for peaceful protests in their communities. These incidents have drawn international condemnation.
