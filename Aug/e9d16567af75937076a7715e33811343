At least 100 people are feared trapped in the debris of a five-storey building that collapsed on Monday in an industrial town in western India, a lawmaker said. TV channels showed footage of the debris with locals and police trying to reach the trapped people. The TV footage also showed at least one ambulance leaving the area as people surrounding it made frantic phone calls. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has assured the local administration of all possible support for speedy rescue and relief work, his office said on Twitter. Rescue efforts are underway as workers and tree teams from the National Disaster Response Force remove the debris and look for survivors at Mahad in Raigad district in the western state of Maharashtra. Old creaky structures and illegal constructions in India often lead to collapses, typically during torrential rain. More than 1,200 people were killed in 1,161 building collapses across India in 2017, according to latest data from the National Crime Records Bureau.
