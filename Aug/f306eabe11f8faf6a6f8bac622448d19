Argentina and Mexico will produce the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for most of Latin America, Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said on Wednesday after a meeting with company executives involved in the project. An agreement signed between British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the biotechnology company mAbxience of the INSUD Group includes transfer of technology to initially produce 150 million doses of the vaccine to supply all of Latin America with the exception of Brazil, the Argentine government said. “Latin American production will be handled in Argentina and Mexico and that will allow timely and efficient access for all countries in the region,” Fernandez said. AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-largest drug-maker, has long operations in Argentina. The company signed a deal with the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim for production of the vaccine, which is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2021, pending Phase III studies and regulatory approvals. Fernandez said the deal “gives Argentina the peace of mind of being able to have the vaccine when required and at a reasonable price.” The South American country, which has passed 5 000 coronavirus fatalities, posted a record daily number of COVID-19 infections on Wednesday with 7 663 new cases. There were more than 200 fatalities over the previous 24-hour period. “This will provide great relief in the future, but it is not a solution for the present,” added Fernandez, pointing to the growing numbers of infections and fatalities.
