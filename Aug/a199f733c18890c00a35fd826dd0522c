Political analyst Oshupeng Maseng says a Cabinet reshuffle within the North West government is long overdue. This after North West Premier, Job Mokgoro, described the failure of some Provincial Executive Council (PEC) members to perform as deeply embarrassing. He was speaking during a meeting with the provincial Legislature’s Chairpersons’ Forum in Mahikeng at the weekend. The forum summoned Mokgoro to account for some MECs’ failure to implement the legislature’s resolutions. Maseng says over the years service delivery in the province has been severely lacking. He, however, says the order to reshuffle the provincial government must be given by the African National Congress (ANC). “I think it has forever been overdue. We have never actually experienced speedy delivery of services and proper management as well [as] performance of these departments. The Premier must try to look at the position of reshuffling.” “Members of provincial legislatures actually have that power to actually [put forward] a motion of no confidence towards members of the executive council. Then the Premier will then be compelled to reconstitute the executive council. In order for the Premier to actually reshuffle, that will have to be a mandate that comes initially from the African National Congress,” adds Maseng.
