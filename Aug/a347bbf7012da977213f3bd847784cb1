The community of Ngxogi village in Ngcobo,  in the Eastern Cape, is shocked after the brutal murder of a 73-year-old woman and her 38-year-old son. Four grandchildren between 12 and 13 years have suffered severe burn wounds and have been rushed to All Saint’s Hospital. A group allegedly attacked the family while sleeping. They allegedly shot, stabbed  and set the rondavel they were sleeping in alight. Four kids were rescued from the blaze by their uncle, Vulithuba Marhamncwa. “We have been attacked, assaulted  and shot at . These people surrounded our rondavel shot us and set alight the rondavel. I tried to rescue the granny because they were shouting the name of his son, I realised that the granny was also stabbed, I then rescued the four kids as young as 13-year-old. But the mother and the son died on the fire.” A local councillor, Thembinkosi Ngxangana, has raised concerns about lack of law enforcement intervention to end the feud between the Blangwe, Bhayi and Ntsundu families. He says 10 people have now been killed in eight months. “It’s more than three months now this thing has been happening .People are killing each other here; there were SMSes that were circulating, threatening each other here and the we tried to forward these to the provincial commissioner but they did not take any intervention up until now because this thing is going on, there is a lot that is going to happen even now.” Ngxangana is calling on Police Minister, Bheki Cele, to intervene in the matter.
