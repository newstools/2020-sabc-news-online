An international forensic report has cleared South African businesswoman, Bridgette Motsepe and Botswana’s former President Ian Khama of money laundering and sponsoring terrorism. The pair were fingered in an alleged plan to finance political unrest leading up to the country’s elections in October 2019. Bridgette Motsepe and Khama were alleged to be part of a conspiracy to bring down President Mokgweetsi Masisi. They have both consistently denied the allegations. The report which is titled “Project Monarch: Flies & Lies”,  found no evidence on financial flows out of Botswana. This matter was sparked by an affidavit written by an investigator that alleged more than 10-million US dollars left Botswana into South African or other international accounts. It further claimed that Bridgette Motsepe was a signatory in some of those bank accounts. But the report has found no documented evidence of the illicit flow of money or anything that would link Khama and Bridgette Motsepe to the accounts in question. The report also claims that the affidavit had glaring inconsistencies and fabrications. Chief investigator, Cherie Blair says it’s puzzling that the prosecutor has run with these charges unless the case was based on fictitious evidence
