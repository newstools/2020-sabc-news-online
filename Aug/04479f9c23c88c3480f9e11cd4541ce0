Western Cape Minister for Transport, Bonginkosi Madikizela, has commended the police for the swift arrest of suspects in connection with taxi violence. Among those arrested is an African National Congress (ANC) councillor in the City of Cape Town. He was arrested on Friday, only hours after a fatal shooting incident at the Bellville taxi rank in which a commuter was shot and killed and another seriously injured. Madikizela says the internal battles between taxi organisations have placed a huge burden on public transport. “It is very concerning that one of those who was arrested is in fact an ANC Councillor in Ward 87 in Khayelitsha. We have seen an increase in the scourge of taxi violence in the Western Cape where many innocent people have lost their lives. We want the police to ensure that those who have been found guilty face the full might of the law,” explains Madikizela. Meanwhile, in July, police launched a probe into six murder cases following taxi-related shootings in Nyanga and Philippi on the Cape Flats.
