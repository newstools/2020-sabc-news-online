Power utility Eskom is to implement Stage 2 load shedding on Tuesday from 4pm until 10pm as the power system is severely constrained. Stage 2 will again be implemented from 9am until 10pm on Wednesday. In a statement, Eskom says, “Yesterday (Monday) six generators were returned to service at Medupi, Tutuka, Kendal Majuba and Grootvlei power stations. The breakdown of four units overnight and this morning (Tuesday) at Medupi, Duvha, Majuba and Lethabo power stations, as well as a delay in the expected return to service of a unit at Medupi has resulted in the power system being constrained.” Below is the full statement: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7039294-Eskom-to-Implement-Stage-2-Load-Shedding.js", {

Economist Azar Jammine has warned that Eskom’s continued failure to meet demand for electricity will make it difficult for the economy to grow. Eskom is struggling to service a R440 billion debt, which it ran up due to surging salaries, fuel and debt-servicing costs, as well as mismanagement and corruption.
