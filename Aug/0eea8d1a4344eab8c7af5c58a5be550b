The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), has described as disgusting and dismaying – allegations of corruption surrounding COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tenders, amounting to millions of rands. Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko, Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku, and his wife Loyiso went on leave of absence recently – amid a scandal over alleged irregularities relating to a R125 million PPE tender. The tender was awarded to Royal Bhaca Projects – a company owned by Diko’s husband.

Failure to do so will leave us with no option but to exercise all our rights and we do not rule out mobilising for the mother of all political strike against a rotten corrupt ANC government.” NUMSA statement on the ANC governments nationwide corruption scandals #ANCMustFall @IrvinJimSA @SAFTU_media pic.twitter.com/Ijl6zv4d34 — NUMSA (@Numsa_Media) August 1, 2020  In the video below, ANC promises to act against corruption:  On Saturday, political parties in Parliament threw their weight behind Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s call for all provincial health MECs to publish the list of all companies awarded COVID- 19 tenders for PPEs.
