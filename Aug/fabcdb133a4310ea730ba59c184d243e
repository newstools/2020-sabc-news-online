It’s been 64 years since thousands of women marched to the Union Buildings in South Africa to protest against the apartheid pass laws for black women on 9 August 1956. Women in South Africa and around the world remain disadvantaged in society. A close look at the statistics on women reveals inequality in business, homes and society. South Africa is among the world’s few gender-balanced Cabinets with 50% of members being women. Women in South Africa remain a minority in the boards of JSE listed companies, the country has fewer female CEOS and few women are employed in the technology-related jobs. Many women get married at a young age and tend to do more unpaid household work than men in their homes. Gender-based violence remains a pandemic in South Africa and women around the world continue to face sexual harassment and physical harassment perpetrated by their intimate partner.
