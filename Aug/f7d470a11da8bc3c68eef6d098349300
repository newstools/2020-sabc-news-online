Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) has sought to explain their reasons for firing Merafong Municipal Mayor Maphefo Letsie and Member of Parliament (MP) Boyce Maneli. Gauteng ANC spokesperson Bones Modise says these executives have failed in their responsibility to ensure that the municipality is protected from getting involved in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal. The bank collapsed in 2018 after billions of rands were looted by its senior executives. The ANC’s provincial integrity committee has meanwhile cleared Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo of any impropriety and conflict of interest. Modise says, “We can confirm that Maphefo and Boyce were executive mayors at a time when this issue surface and they had executive responsibilities and had to take executive decisions and in this instance, the commission found that they did take responsibility against those involved in this even though they would have been advised against investing money in the VBS in failure to execute their responsibilities given to them. They have to take responsibility and the buck stops with them as the executive mayors.” In the video below is a report on Letsie and Maneli:
