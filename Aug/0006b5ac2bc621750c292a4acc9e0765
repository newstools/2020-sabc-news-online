Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko has appealed again to citizens in the province to drink responsibly. This follows Sunday morning’s horror crash in which three Tshwane Metro Police officers were killed in a head-on collision with a suspected drunk driver. The officers were providing back-up in pursuit of a vehicle that was reported to not have stopped when instructed by other traffic officers. The driver then collided head-on with the back-up vehicle. Department Spokesperson, Pinkie Numa says it’s been less than a week since the sale of alcohol ban has been lifted. “It is less than a week since the sale of alcohol has been opened under the national disaster act regulations. And the driver suspected of being drunk has taken three lives of law enforcement officers. MEC Mazibuko sends heartfelt condolences to the colleagues.” ‘Alcohol abuse’ The lifting of the alcohol ban has again put South Africa’s consumption patterns and the errant behaviour that goes with it, in the spotlight. The Association for Alcohol Responsibility and Education (Aware) is urging those who consume alcohol to realise that alcohol abuse has grave consequences. The Chief Executive Officer of Aware, Ingride Louw says binge drinking and its consequences could result in stricter lockdown regulations. “We want to encourage the public to adopt a responsible lifestyle. In the current context of COVID-19, people need to practice social distancing. You need to wear a mask, observe the 10 pm curfew. Especially with the lifting of the alcohol ban, we don’t want people to engage in binge drinking, drinking and driving. We want to ask traders to trade responsibly. When you drink and drive, that can result in road fatalities. It can also lead to aggressive behaviour.” South Africans queue to purchase alcohol after the lifting of the ban:
