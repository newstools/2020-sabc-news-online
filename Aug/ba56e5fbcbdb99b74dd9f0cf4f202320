Former Eskom Board Chairperson Jabu Mabuza has denied allegations of impropriety over a tender awarded to his niece. Eskom is alleged to have flouted tender processes at the time Mabuza was Chairperson. In this video below, Eskom cancels tender linked to Jabu Mabuza’s niece:  A report in the Mail and Guardian alleges that a R100-million tender, to maintain the boiler tubes at Medupi power station was awarded to the company of Nomvula Mabuza, IDS Africa, in February 2019. It has since been cancelled. Senior investigative journalist at the Mail and Guardian, Sabelo Skiti says Eskom did not do the necessary checks to determine any conflict of interest. “The relationship wasn’t declared on both sides when submitting a bid in an SOE or a government department, the internal people at supply chain would then run your name in the system to see if there’s any relationship that you haven’t declared. Now for some reason in this particular contract that was not done.” “Mabuza through his chief of staff he always insists that he had no idea that Nomvula Mabuza had actually bid but if you look at the timing of the company being set up its only when Jabu Mabuza becomes Chairperson of the Eskom board that Nomvula Mabuza registers this company and then starts bidding for work at Eskom. “ Mabuza resigned after admitting that he had failed to keep his promise that there would be no load shedding before  January 13 2020.
