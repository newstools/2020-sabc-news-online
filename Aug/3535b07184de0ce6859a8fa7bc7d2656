The Walter Sisulu University student, Sibongile Mani, who received more than R14 million in her student account from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) and is accused of spending more than R800 000 of that money was due to appear in the East London Regional Court. The case was postponed without anybody appearing in court due to bereavement in the family of one of the legal representatives in the matter. The case was postponed to August 28, 2020. Mani is facing a charge of theft related to the money she spent. The video below reports that Mani’s account has been blocked and she’s liable for the debt:  The R14-million was credited to her during June 2017. The accounting student was only entitled to R1400. It is alleged the millions were erroneously deposited into her account by Intelli-mali. The company is contracted by the NSFAS to make payments to students. Mani is currently out on bail.
