The South Africa National Taxi Council (Santaco) in KwaZulu-Natal has welcomed the arrest of three alleged hit-men linked to the recent spate of taxi-related violence in the province. The arrests were part of a multi-disciplinary operation comprising the Crime Intelligence Unit and the Provincial Taxi Task Team. The suspects were apprehended in Newtown A, Inanda earlier this week and were found in possession of a firearm and ammunition. Santaco provincial manager Sifiso Shangase says, “We hope then that this unit is going to be able to deal with all the pocketed violent areas within the province of KZN and that will reduce the number of casualties in and around KZN as well as within the minibus taxi industry and this is yielding positive results for all of us, especially the commuters…” “We hope that the perpetrators will be brought to book and eventually the source is also going to be punished, rather than we punish the person who is pulling the trigger only,” added Shangase. The suspects appeared in the Ntunzuma Magistrate’s Court on charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Lindokuhle Dlamini 28, Lucky Shabalala 32, and Siboniso Mpungose 34, were remanded in custody and the case postponed to August 19 for a formal bail application. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says, “The suspects were found in possession of a 9mm, with five rounds of ammunition. A follow up operation was also conducted at Phasa area in KwaMakhutha where three rifles were found, which includes an AK 47 and 81 live rounds of ammunition. They will also be profiled to check if they are not linked to a recent series of taxi related cases that have been taking place in the province.”
