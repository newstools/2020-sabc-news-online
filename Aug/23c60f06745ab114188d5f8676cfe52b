Mineworkers in Marikana, in the North West, say they are still awaiting justice for their colleagues who were shot and killed eight years ago. This as Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) commemorates the eighth anniversary of the Marikana tragedy in Johannesburg. It is the first time that the commemoration is hosted outside the North West – where 34 mineworkers were killed after being shot by heavily armed police officers. Amcu members at Lonmin mine were striking for a R12 500 basic monthly salary. Xolani Nzuza, one of the leaders of the strike in 2012, says: “There is no one who has been arrested so far. Even IPID is busy with some cases but there is no progress. We’ve seen a few people arrested, but it’s not the main culprits. We need people like Nathi Mthethwa, they are not there.” SABC News reporter Sellwane Khaukhau is in Marikana at the scene of the shooting:  Earlier Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa lamented the broken prommises made to the mining community of  Nkaneng Informal Settlement in Marikana, in the North West. Mathunjwa told SABC News that the lives of the community members have not yet been improved, despite the promises made by the then mining company Lonmin, which is now Sibanye Stillwater. He says the only positive that came from the Marikana tragedy is the increase in mineworkers’ salaries. In the video below, Mathunjwa speaks to the SABC News:
