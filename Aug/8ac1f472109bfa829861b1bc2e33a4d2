Health expert in infectious diseases from Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town, Professor Marc Mendelssohn, says the reason the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) tests conducted in the country have decreased now than about a month ago, is because there are less coronavirus transmissions. The number of COVID19 related deaths now stands at 11 010, with more people dying in the last 24 hours. The cumulative number of infections is at 568 919. The recovery rate now stands at 432 029 which translates to a recovery rate of 75,9%. Professor Mendelssohn says, “The main reason is simply that there is less transmission therefore less symptomatic people, less people actually getting the virus which causes COVID19.  We’re doing less tests in the community. In our hospitals, we’re seeing this as well with the reduction in admissions, obviously it does depend on which province we’re talking about, but certainly in the Western Cape was the first to see this, where a hospital admissions are strikingly down and therefore we’re doing less tests in the hospitals.” Below, COVID-19 statistics  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 194 685 101 499 82 779 10 875 22 205 19 755 6 957 UNALLOCATED 50 AS AT 12 August 2020 2332 127 149 DEATHS 414 3485 2761 1524 150 CONFIRMED CASES | 568 919 DEATHS |  11 010 TESTS CONDUCTED |3 295 434 RECOVERIES | 432 029 CLOSED CASES | 443 039 100 536 29 578 68 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); South Africa continues to see a drop in the number of new COVID-19 infections.
