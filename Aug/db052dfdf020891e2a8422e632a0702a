The Health Department has refuted allegations that the Democratic Alliance’s shadow minister of Health Siviwe Gwarube has made on social media regarding the Maseve Field Hospital in the North West. Gwarube alleged that the hospital had not been erected and that the field was bare and no progress had been made. However the department alleges that she was on a different site than the one earmarked for the facility. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize held a telephonic conversation with Gwarube over the claims in which she is alleged to have apologised and admitted her mistake.

In a series of tweets, Gwarube recently implied that lies were told about the status of the Maseve Field Hospital in North West.https://t.co/QfMM3Cjd3m — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) August 7, 2020 However Gwarube then took to social media again and relayed the call as Mkhize’s attempt to explain himself to her. I’ve noted Dr Mkhize’s comments regarding my oversight visit in Rustenburg. Regrettable as they are, I’ve issued a clarification on the purpose of the visit & the findings. Oversight work is critical especially during #COVID19. Mpumalanga see ya soon! https://t.co/uUzWeXbFcm — Siviwe Gwarube (@Siviwe_G) August 7, 2020  Mkhize has appealed to Gwarube to retract her statement and issue a public apology.
