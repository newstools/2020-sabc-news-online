Power utility Eskom will implement stage 2 load shedding from 8am until 10pm Thursday night. The power utility says this is due to an increase in generation unit breakdowns overnight. Eskom says there’s a high possibility that the load shedding could be escalated to Stage 3 for the evening peak. The constrained electricity supply could run into the weekend. Eskom spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says, “Eskom regrets informing the country that starting from 8 this morning, we will have to implement load shedding stage 2. This is due to the increase in breakdowns overnight and this morning. We will be implementing stage 2 load shedding as we have had additional breakdowns overnight.” Eskom Load Reduction Notice Date: 12 August 2020 #Eskom_FreeState will implement load reduction on Thursday,
