Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has dismissed an application by Judge Tintswalo Makhubele to have her testimony postponed. This is the second time the Judge is asking for a postponement. In July, Makhubele sent her legal representatives to the commission to request a postponement citing trauma caused by a tyre burst. Earlier on Monday, Makhubele said she had not yet consulted her new legal team and was therefore not ready to testify. She also said there were some people that had launched a smear campaign against her. “Because chair I have not had site of evidence of Mr Nowe and Diginswayo, I may need to supplement and obviously with the assistance of my legal team and I am not scared of those allegations but what I’m scared [of] is the perception that has been created. The perception that I am this arrogant person, disrespectful, refusing to work with the commission, they have given me a name state capture judge,” she adds. In the video below, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo expresses his dissatisfaction over Judge Tintswalo Makhubele’s absence at the State Capture Inquiry:  Former President Jacob Zuma appointed Judge Tintswalo Makhubele when she was the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) interim Board chair. This according to evidence given this month by Senior Advocate Francois Botes who worked on the Prasa and Siyaya litigation process. Botes alleges that the judge was appointed by Zuma to sort out the mess at the state-owned entity. Makhubele was appointed as a judge with effect from 1 January 2018, and was also appointed as Prasa Board chair during the same time. Makhubele later laid a complaint against Botes.
