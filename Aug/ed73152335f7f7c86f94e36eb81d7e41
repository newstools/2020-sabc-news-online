Former Free State Human Settlements Department DG, Thabani Zulu to continue testifying at the State Capture Inquiry on Thursday afternoon. Livestream:   Earlier Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo has dismissed a request by lawyers for Thabani Zulu to their client’s testimony to be postponed at the State Capture Commission. Zulu wanted to first cross-examine former Free State MEC for Economic Affairs, Mxolisi Dukwana who made allegations about his role in facilitating a 2014, R255-million Asbestos project, and benefits of money and luxury cars given to him and other department officials. Commission Evidence leader, Paul Pretorious gave reasons why Zulu should testify. “He gave evidence of a largely speculative nature that the Commission and the commission’s investigators have put aside entirely they have done their own investigations they have done their own work and if it those investigations and that work that has already been put to Mr Zulu in the questions and it is that investigation and the products of that investigation that we will deal with in questioning hopefully today so there is an entire break between what Mr Dukwana said on the one hand and what we are dealing with today with Mr Zulu.”
