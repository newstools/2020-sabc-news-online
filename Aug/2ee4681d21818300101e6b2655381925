Opposition parties in the trouble-torn Mangaung Metro have vowed to block attempts by the ANC to reinstate former Free State Co-operative Governance MEC, Olly Mlamleli, as the executive mayor. Mlamleli, who is also municipal body Salga Chairperson in the Free State was toppled through a motion of no confidence after disgruntled ANC councillors voted with the opposition. The Freedom Front Plus (FFPlus) which brought the motion insists that council resolutions cannot be rescinded within three months. Mangaung Council Speaker, Mxolisi Siyonzana, who is also the ANC Regional Task Team chairperson, is expected to formally declare the results on Friday afternoon. EFF’s Council Whip in the Mangaung Metro, Paballo Poone-Rankhola, says service delivery has collapsed since Mlamleli took over the mayoral position in 2016. “We are very disappointed as the EFF to notice and see that the ANC reward looting with positions. If they had the best interest of city at heart, I believe that they would bring another accountable candidate for that matter,” adds Poone-Rankhola. Meanwhile, the ANC in the Free State has threatened to take stern action against councillors who voted with opposition parties in the Mangaung Metro Municipality in Bloemfontein to oust Executive Mayor Olly Mlamleli last week.
