Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa ( Denosa)  in Gauteng says it will ensure that those putting health care workers’ lives at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic are brought to book. The union briefed the media in Johannesburg on their visits to different healthcare facilities in the province. It says working conditions in hospitals, like the George Mkhari Hospital in Tshwane, are bad and that some workers are being forced to work without proper Personal Protective Equipment. Denosa Provincial Chairperson, Simphiwe Gada, urged members to report managers who force them to work without PPEs. He has also encouraged managers to inform the union when the Health Department fails to supply the required protective equipment “We want to warn managers who continue to intimidate workers to work without PPEs that we will not tolerate that behaviour. But equally, on the same breath, this period of COVID-19 has been plagued with command, control and complain later, that managers also find themselves being forced to implement wrong things. They must reach out to us as a union so that we can intervene.” Gauteng currently has 200 237 coronavirus cases which is 33,9% of the total number of cases in the country.
