Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has told the legal team of Judge Tintswalo Makhubele that she had enough time to prepare for her testimony. Makhubele is seeking yet another postponement to appear before the Commission in Johannesburg. Various witnesses have implicated her in alleged corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Makhubele failed to appear before the Commission in July. She instead sent her legal representatives to request a postponement after citing reasons including her car losing control due to a tyre puncture. Zondo says due to the Commission’s time constraints a postponement is not likely to be granted. In the video below, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo expresses his dissatisfaction over Judge Tintswalo Makhubele’s absence at the State Capture Inquiry:  Former President Jacob Zuma appointed Judge Tintswalo Makhubele when she was the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) interim Board chair. This according to evidence given this month by Senior Advocate Francois Botes who worked on the Prasa and Siyaya litigation process. Botes alleges that the judge was appointed by Zuma to sort out the mess at the state-owned entity. Makhubele was appointed as a judge with effect from 1 January 2018, and was also appointed as Prasa Board chair during the same time. Makhubele later laid a complaint against Botes.
