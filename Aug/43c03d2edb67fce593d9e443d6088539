The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) says it is optimistic that it will recover billions of rands that Eskom has lost through state capture. Eskom and the SIU have issued court summons to several people to try and recoup R3.8 billion that the power utility’s former executives diverted to the Gupta family. They include Brian Molefe, Matshela Koko, and Ben Ngubane. Earlier, SIU Spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago, explaining why the unit had opted for the civil route, instead of laying criminal charges, said, “We are working in terms of our mandate and we are part of the law enforcement agencies in this country.  Therefore, we are not saying that by following the money and trying to recover the money the criminal side of things will not happen.
