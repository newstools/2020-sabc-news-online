The Department of Public Enterprises has welcomed Eskom’s efforts to recoup R3.8-billion in funds lost as a result of State capture corruption. On Monday, Eskom and the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) announced that summons has been issued in the North Gauteng High Court to recover funds from Eskom’s former executives, former board members, members of the Gupta family and their associates. Some of the defendants in Eskom’s court action include former employees Brian Molefe, Anoj Singh, Matshela Koko, Suzanne Margaret Daniels, as well as former Board chairman Dr Ben Ngubane. Department spokesperson Sam Mkokeli says they welcome the move. “This is an important milestone in the fight against corruption and State capture. We would want to see more people who have been found to be complicit and benefited from mass corruption to be held accountable. Therefore the DPE supports this claim for R3.8 billion,” adds Mkokeli. “We also support other investigations by the SIU and many other State agencies who have been looking into cases of mass corruption in the State. So we will work closely with Eskom and other state-owned companies to ensure that all these cases of corruption lead to justice for South Africans,” he explains. In a statement, Eskom says they lost R3.8 billion in funds illegally. The defendants are former Eskom employees Brian Molefe, Anoj Singh,  Matshela Koko as well as Suzanne Margaret Daniels.
