The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein will hear an appeal of two convicted men, Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte. The pair approached the SCA in a bid to overturn the North West High Court’s decision which found them guilty of murder, kidnapping and intimidation. The two murdered 16-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu after accusing him of stealing sunflowers. Mosweu was thrown from a moving vehicle. Doorewaard and Schutte were sentenced to 18 and 23 years in jail. Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte found guilty of the murder of Matlhomola Mosweu:  They are appealing against their conviction on the grounds that Bonakele Pakisi was not a credible or reliable state witness. In November 2019, the duo were granted R20 000 bail each pending the appeal at the SCA. The SCA has indicated that there was reasonable chance the court could come to a different finding. The case sparked a public outcry with many saying racism was the determining factor for the men’s actions.
