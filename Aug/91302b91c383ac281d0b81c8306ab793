Latin America broke through 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Monday, a Reuters tally showed, underscoring the region’s position as the area of the world hardest hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus was initially slower to reach Latin America – home to about 640 million people – than much of the world. But health experts say it has been hard to control the virus due to the region’s poverty and densely packed cities. The more than 10 000 new cases reported by Colombia’s Health Ministry on Monday pushed the region past the 5 million mark, a day after the Andean nation reported a record 11 470 cases. Brazil’s total approached 96 000 on Monday and Mexico surpassed 48 000. The two countries have the world’s second and third highest death tolls, after the United States. Latin America is particularly vulnerable to the virus due to high levels of poverty, urbanization, and labor informality, according to a July 30 report by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Pan American Health Organization. More than 100 million people across Latin America and the Caribbean live in slums, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. “The pandemic has become an precedented economic and social crisis and, if urgent measures are not taken, it could transform into a food, humanitarian, and political crisis,” the report warned.
