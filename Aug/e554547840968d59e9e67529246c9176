The Department of Public Enterprises has rejected newspaper reports that Minister Pravin Gordhan revoked the appointment of the first black woman to be the chairperson of Eskom pension and provident fund and instead appointed Caroline Henry to the position. The department describes the Sunday Independent report as having been manufactured by an arrogant and destructive cabal employed to tarnish the reputation of all those fighting against corruption and to defend malfeasance. According to Public Enterprises, the choice and appointment of the Pension Fund chairperson is entirely the responsibility of Eskom. DPE says Minister Gordhan approved Henry’s appointment based on the information before
him. “And at no stage of the process did the DPE or the Minister contribute, suggest, or veto
any names.” The department is urging South Africans to give the pension fund space to do its work, while ensuring the nation of its commitment to the transformation agenda that seeks to reverse the wrongs of apartheid and the recent State Capture atrocities.
