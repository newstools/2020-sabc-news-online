In the video below, ANC in Thaba-Nchu aggrieved about the quality of food parcels in the Free State:  For #Mandela Week we donated over 4, 000 food parcels to communities across Gauteng, the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Free State. pic.twitter.com/DCsU1XUWEG — Life Healthcare (@LifeHealthcare_) July 16, 2020  “I am not working and I stay here with no food, I always have to make a plan.” “The food is even rotten now, potatoes and beetroot are smelling at the municipality.”Residents say they’ve been stripped off their dignity for too long. They say no kind of proper service delivery have been received in the area. Meanwhile, the ANC councillor Kagiso Moeketse from ward one insists that the food is still in good condition… “Those who are masquerading, those who took pictures of the food found in the municipal offices must tell us the truth because there’s no rotten food there. The food that we have it’s only potatoes and mealie meal. There is a program that is meant to be followed by the committee on how food should be distributed.” The Kopanong municipality has denied any knowledge of food parcels at the municipality. Municipal Manager Martin Kubheka says investigations are underway… “After this matter was brought to our attention, we have launched a full investigation, the investigation is under way and we view this in a very serious light. And after this, we will then come back to the public and give a full report as to what happened, what led to that.” This poverty-stricken area has a high unemployment rate. The majority survive hand-to-mouth. In the video below, Free State community pleads with government to supply them with food:
