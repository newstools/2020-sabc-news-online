The UN Security Council has expressed its deep concern regarding recent developments from Mali – just as the AU Peace and Security Council suspended the country due to the unconstitutional change of government. The New York based Council met virtually on Wednesday to discuss the situation.  It has strongly condemned the mutiny in Kati, Mali, which led to the arrest of the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and several members of the Government.
