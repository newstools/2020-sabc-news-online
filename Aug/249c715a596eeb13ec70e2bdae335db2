Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha says the law must deal with the criminal behaviour of people who are looting resources meant to fight the coronavirus (COVID-19). He used his virtual provincial women’s day address to condemn the looting of COVID-19 relief funds meant for the purchasing of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other resources. “The reports that people have been lining their pockets including the pockets of their family members and relatives with money meant to fight the virus have been looting state resources that were meant to provide food to the needy families and personal protective equipment’s to frontline officials, particularly our health care workers, this is unacceptable criminal behaviour which must be dealt with the full might of law.” Meanwhile, the Free State Treasury has dismissed reports that people with political connections are prioritised in the awarding of tenders. This response was prompted by reports that those close to former Free State Premier and current African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule benefitted from PPE tenders worth millions in the province. The video below is about the Free State tender issues:  Monopolisation of tenders Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has lamented men’s monopolisation of tenders to provide PPEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Malema was speaking during his party’s Women’s Day celebrations which were held at the gravesite of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Fourways north of Johannesburg. “Where is the department of women to intervene when tenders of PPEs are given to males only. Remember the PPEs are very essential services and people who know how to provide essential services are women, but where money exchanges hands in essential services the good caring people who know how to provide essential services are excluded.” –Additional reporting Busi Chimombe
