Residents of Ga-Motlatla near Ventersdorp in the North West have stopped a contractor from installing water metres in their yards. The community says the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality as the water authority did not consult them about the project. The water authority secured the contractor’s services for R14 million. Community representative Mokhuwe Masekwa says the installation of water metres is a waste of money. “We do not want water metres in Ga-Motlatla. The municipality must make sure that they take their R14 million and direct it somewhere. We are fine with it. We are certain about our stand, we do not want metres in Ga-Motlatla, we are not ready and for the next coming ten years Ga-Motlatla will not be ready for metres.” Meanwhile, the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality says it has engaged the community more than once. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Municipal Services Gilbert Mathakathaka says, “The consultation was done thoroughly almost 10 times and the community agreed upon the yard connection… is when now the process was started after being funded for that project of yard connection, this is where now certain individuals who were not there by the time the consultation started now they raise that issue.” In the video below SABC News speaks to residents:
