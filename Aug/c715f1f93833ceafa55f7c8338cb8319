The Department of Basic Education has dismissed reports that some schools are without running water. This as most grades return to school this Monday morning, with some grades getting days off weekly, amid the coronavirus pandemic. Teacher unions have complained that rural and township schools do not yet have the necessary personal protective equipment, clean water, additional classes and substitute teachers to assist with adherance to new Covid 19 protocols. DBE Spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, says they have ensured health and safety protocols are in place. “The water has been delivered. In May and June, when we were preparing for the reopening of schools, we did indicate that we signed an agreement with Rand Water to deliver water around the country to schools that did not have. So the reports that we are getting from all provinces is that all schools are going to open, they all have water tanks, which are delivered to all the schools.” The South African Department of Basic Education began phasing in the reopening of schools on the 1st of June. The announcement was made by the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga. The department has released an outline of its proposed plans to reopen schools as the world battles the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The plan outlines regulations on social distancing, classroom, transport as well as screening and testing regulations. According to the plan, hugging and shaking hands will not be allowed in schools. Only two learners will be permitted to share a desk. Some parents and teachers’ unions around South Africa have raised concerns about reopening schools too quickly. This as some schools in South Africa remain overcrowded without proper sanitation and running water.
