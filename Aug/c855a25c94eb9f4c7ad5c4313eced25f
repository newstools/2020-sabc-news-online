The National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) is to nominate senior leadership who will serve on a team that will, over the next three weeks, draw up a set of priority actions for economic reconstruction to address the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed Nedlac, where he tabled a set of economic recovery programmes featuring mass employment schemes and anti-retrenchment measures, encompassed in a proposal to forge a jobs compact in South Africa. The team will focus on such areas as job creation. They will have a sectoral approach, prioritising infrastructure, the need for urgent attention on energy security and working on the constraints to economic growth. There is broad agreement that proposals for economic recovery need to be underpinned by immediate measures to protect jobs and livelihoods as well as build a capable state. The team will present NEDLAC and the president with an economic recovery action plan that will be submitted to Cabinet for endorsement. On Saturday night, Ramaphosa announced the unbanning of alcohol and cigarette sales in a bid to help the countryâ€™s economy. In an address to the nation, Ramaphosa made the following changes as the country moves to Alert Level 2, which allows for more economic activities.
