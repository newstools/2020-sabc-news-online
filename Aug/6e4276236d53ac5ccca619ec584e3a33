Omeros Corp on Monday reported positive results from a six-patient study of its investigational treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by COVID-19. The company said all the six patients, who needed mechanical ventilation before treatment, recovered and were discharged from hospital. A manuscript detailing the results of the study has been accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Immunobiology, Omeros said. Shares of the company soared 44% to $20.25 in premarket trading. The news comes as efforts to find a cure for the coronavirus continue around the world. Pharmaceutical giant CIPLA has manufactured thousands of dosages of the anti-viral drug Remdesivir, which has been shown to shorten recovery time for COVID-19 patients. CIPLA was granted a licence to manufacture after the drug was first tested by the United Statesâ€™ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May. The pharmaceutical giant now manufactures and distributes Remdesivir to 127 countries. South Africa is among those countries.
