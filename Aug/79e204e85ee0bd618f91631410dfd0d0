Regional body, Southern African Development Community, is hosting the Organ Troika Summit on Politics and Defence virtually on Wednesday to discuss security in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The summit will consider the United Nations-SADC engagement on the Force Intervention Brigade’s reconfiguration. President Cyril Ramaphosa will participate in this meeting. More than 1 500 people have been killed between October 2019 and June this year in the northeastern region of the country – which is ravaged by violent conflict. The Organ Troika will look at how the Brigade can be restructured to be more effective in bringing stability to the DRC. The Brigade is a military formation authorised by the UN Security Council and forms part of the UN Mission in the southern African country. The Organ chair is Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa who’s been accused of violating human rights in his country – ordering a crackdown on those calling for reform. SADC leaders have also been criticised for turning a blind eye towards Zimbabwe.
