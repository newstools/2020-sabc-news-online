He was advised to test again after coming into contact with someone who tested positive last week. He says he is being inundated with messages wishing him a speedy recovery. “I didn’t feel any pain anywhere. I have no sign even now. I’m in good fettle. I’m in perfect fettle, so therefore I am abiding by the rule. Doctors said I must isolate. I would like to thank your majesty for the king. He’s been very concerned about me. He has even sent some things which he thought could help me. Even other people have done so. I am very grateful.” Earlier, National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Amos Masondo wished veteran Buthelezi, a speedy recovery.
