Tenants who escaped the fire at flats in front of the Juma Mosque in the Durban CBD say they have lost a fair amount of their possessions. About 14 flats were affected. A fire broke out on Monday in one of the flats that is used by people who work at the mosque. It has now been confirmed that the fire has not affected the mosque itself. Some tenants explain how the fire has affected them. “I saw the smoke come out, so metro police came out and said everyone must come out, everyone. But we are all Ok and very lucky. I lost the furniture there and I have a gym there. My wife had cash there and everything there,” says a tenant. “I was busy taking a shower in my bathroom and I heard my child crying and screaming talking to me, but I couldn’t hear what she was saying. The maid came and saw the fire and smoke everything. The maid told me to come out of the building as I was taking a shower.  I had nothing to do but put a towel around me and ran out of my house. All my belongings and all that I had, all gone. I have nothing, the goods that I sell at the market and over 40 000 cash, just over 40 000,” explains another tenant. The cause of the fire has not yet been established. In the video below is the report on the fire:
