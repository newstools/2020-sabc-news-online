Former Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani has returned to the coalition government as a Member of the Mayoral Committee for Infrastructure and Engineering, replacing the African National Congress (ANC)’s Andile Lungisa. Lungisa resigned from the position on Sunday following a meeting with the ANC Provincial Executive Committee. Comrades I have stepped down as a member of the Mayoral Committee. Thank you very much with your support. History beckons us to mould our collective will and conscious into one. — Andile Lungisa (@mrlungisa) August 2, 2020  Bobani was ousted as Mayor through a motion of no confidence in December 2019. He says he is already hard at work. “That department is a very important …[it’s a] strategic department. Therefore as from now, the appointment starts today. As I’m talking with you, I am busy at work,” adds Bobani. However, the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay region which is part of the coalition says it rejects the appointment of Bobani as the MMC. ANC regional spokesperson JP Pretorius says the appointment was made by Acting Mayor Thsonono Buyeye without any consultation which they view as undermining the ANC.
