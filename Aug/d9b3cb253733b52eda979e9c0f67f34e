Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize says that they are preparing submissions and will need to make certain recommendations on easing some lockdown restrictions to the President. He was responding to a question on Morning Live on whether President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation on the possibility of moving the country to Level two of the national lockdown soon. This comes ahead of the expiry of the Declaration of a National State of Disaster this coming Saturday. “Well, we are preparing submissions. We will need to make certain recommendations on easing some restrictions and the Coronavirus Command Council has to take into account a lot of issues and out of that then the President is going to be able to give us a guide as to what we are able to do and so on,” says Mkhize. He says that in order for any of the restrictions to be eased, the President has to have a thorough analysis of the scientific basis for all the advice given to him. “But as you would have seen the President wants to have a thorough analysis of all the scientific basis for all the advice that is given, the trends, all the analysis and all the various sectors that have to make a contribution so that he can then make up firm guidance for the whole country. So we will look forward to that.” The Minister has reiterated the continuous use of containment measures. “I would say if we really want to see things changing and the restrictions being eased we really must focus on masks and use our hand santisers and wash hands. If we do so I think we will be able to get good news.” Dr. Mkhize says in the past few weeks, the number of people coming into hospitals and clinics with COVID-19 symptoms has drastically reduced because the surge is slowly passing.
