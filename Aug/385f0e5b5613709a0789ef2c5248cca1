Western Cape Agriculture MEC, Ivan Meyer, says he is concerned about the COVID-19 infection rate in Langeberg and Breede Valley in the Cape Winelands District. By the end of last month, Breede Valley reported 2 727 cases, of which 287 were still active, with 70 deaths. During the same time, Langeberg reported 959 cases, with 113 still active, and 32 deaths. Meyer says the increase in the number of young people infected is of concern. “Both Langeberg and Breede Valley have extensive humanitarian and clinical care facilities for COVID-19 patients and the respective communities. I call on all our citizens in Langeberg and Breede Valley to wear your face masks, maintain social distances and regularly sanitise your hands and surfaces. Together we will beat the virus in Langeberg and Breede Valley,” explains Meyer. #COVID19 Statistics in SA as at 04 August. pic.twitter.com/MNrs06VkXU — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) August 4, 2020  Meanwhile, in July, the Western Cape government said there has been a steady decline in COVID-19 infections and related deaths in recent days. Head of the Health Department, Dr Keith Cloete, says the decline in numbers is mainly due to safety protocols. The province currently has just under 3 000 COVID related deaths with over 75 000 recoveries.
