The race for the new Democratic Alliance (DA) Cape Metro regional chairperson is heating up. Current chairperson Grant Twigg says he will stand for re-elector for a second term in the position during the regional congress on the 3rd of October. Twigg’s supporters believe he is the right man for the job. He survived a motion of no confidence against him last year. Twigg has formally announced his intention to stand in one of the most powerful positions in the DA. He is up against Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato who also announced his intention to run for the position. “I can confirm that I will be contesting the elections of the metro region. Other colleagues will also be contesting. In terms of the constitution of the party, any member is allowed to contest any position,” says Twigg. Regional Member, Malusi Booi, who is also the Mayco member for human settlements, says Twigg has the support of more than a hundred DA branches. “I am referring to the majority of branches, out of the 115 and also the majority of the councillors, who have asked him to re-stand for re-election … so, I am referring to those.” Political Analyst, Asanda Ngoasheng says the upcoming congress of the DA in the Cape Metro is the one to watch.  Ngoasheng says each candidate has a difficult task at hand as the congress comes at the eve of local government elections next year. “Dan Plato seem to be a man of the DA. He seems to be easily accepted by the people within the DA whereas Grant Twig has had a lot of controversy surrounding him including an attempt to actually remove him. In September 2019, there was an attempt to remove Grant from leadership. He was accused of dividing the party.” Cape Town Mayor Plato was not readily available for comment.
