Germany on Friday warned against travel to Brussels because of the high rate of coronavirus infections in the Belgian capital, which is also home to the main organs of the European Union. The German Foreign Ministry warned against non-essential travel to EU regions where there have been more than 50 COVID-19 cases per 100 000 inhabitants over the past week. Belgium’s province of Antwerp is already subject to a warning. “There is currently a warning in place for non-essential, tourist travel to the capital Brussels and the province of Antwerp,” the ministry said on its travel advice website. The restrictions mean returnees face a compulsory virus test and two weeks’ quarantine if they refuse. The Ministry also issued a warning against travel to French Guyana, the French overseas province in South America that is home to the European Space Agency’s main spaceport.
