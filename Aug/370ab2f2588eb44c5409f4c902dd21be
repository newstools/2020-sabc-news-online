The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it wants answers from Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula about what the party refers to as ‘flip-flopping’ over a South African National Defence Force report on the death of Collins Khosa in Alexandra, allegedly at the hands of soldiers. This follows the Military Ombud’s finding that soldiers acted improperly, irregularly, and in contravention of their code of conduct. The DA says the ombud’s finding is the first step towards holding the perpetrators accountable. However, the DA says the minister had earlier submitted a signed affidavit in support of the chief of the SANDF’s report that had exonerated four soldiers. Khosa’s family reacted to the report:   The soldiers in question were not even disciplined before the court ordered them, and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers implicated, to be suspended. — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) August 20, 2020  Mapisa-Nqakula said the report was preliminary,  a claim denied by the SANDF, which said it was final. The party says the minister then retracted her comments. DA Shadow Defence Minister Kobus Marais has welcomed the ombud’s finding against the soldiers and says the minister has not responded to questions about the SANDF report that had exonerated the soldiers. South Africans do not need a Minister that will sweep injustice under the carpet. We need a Minister of Defence that will defend her people and not allow herself to be led by the nose. If Mapisa-Nqakula cannot fulfil such basic requirements, maybe it is time for someone capable. — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) August 20, 2020
