The Congress of South African Students (Cosas)  has asked the Department of Basic Education to only test matric learners on 50% of the curriculum. A survey conducted by teacher unions revealed that only 62% of schools nationwide would have covered the matric syllabus by November when exams start.

Cosas spokesperson Douglas Ngobeni says they have already pitched the idea to the department. “The department had considered actually moving in that fashion so we were very concerned and we are still concerned. The only way is for the learners to be examined on the basis of 50% of the curriculum since there were many challenges that led to them not completing the curriculum,” explains Ngobeni.
