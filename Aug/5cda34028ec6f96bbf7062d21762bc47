The State Capture Commission will hear the testimony of Free State Human Settlements Head of Department, Tim Mokhesi, on Friday. Mokhesi was key to ensuring that the provinceâ€™s 2014 business plan was amended to accommodate a R255 million project, to audit and assess low-cost houses with asbestos roofs in the Free State. Officials connected to the project including Mokhesi are alleged to have received bribes in the form of money, cars and gifts from the joint venture Blackhead-Diamond Hill which carried out the audit for a fraction of the money awarded by the department The role of Tim Mokesi in facilitating the transfer of the asbestos project from the Gauteng Province to the Free State will come under the spotlight.
