Facebook Inc on Wednesday took down a post by US President Donald Trump, which the company said violated its rules against sharing misinformation about the coronavirus. The post contained a video clip, from an interview with Fox & Friends earlier in the day, Trump claimed that children are “almost immune” to COVID-19. “This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19, which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation,” a Facebook spokesperson said. The spokesperson said it was the first time that the social media company had removed a Trump post for coronavirus misinformation. It also appeared to be the first reported instance of Facebook taking down a post from the president for breaching its misinformation rules. It had also taken down both Trump posts and campaign ads that showed a red inverted triangle, a symbol the Nazis used to identify political prisoners, for violating its policy against organised hate. A Trump tweet containing the video was still available on Twitter on Wednesday evening. Twitter Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
