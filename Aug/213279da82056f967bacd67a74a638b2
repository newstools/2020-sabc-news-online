Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says even with the slowing down of coronavirus infections in the province the economy continues to suffer. Winde says businesses that employ tens of thousands of people are struggling under continued restrictions on economic activity. Thousands of people have lost their jobs over the past five months as businesses face closure. Winde says if the lockdown regulations are not relaxed further and a ban on the sale of alcohol lifted, many more will have to close. Winde says nearly 200 000 people from vulnerable communities will no longer have an income to put food on the table. “ We have flattened the curve sufficiently that we will support the opening of the economy safely.  Each and every one of those businesses need to operate under a new normal but our capacity is now in place sufficiently to allow economic growth and job creation.” The Western Cape has a total of 99959 coronavirus cases. This is 17.9% of the total number of cases in South Africa. The province has recorded 3399 deaths and 86677 recoveries.

Madikizela met role players in the taxi and bus industries and also travelled to several roadblocks in the region.
He says his department wants to ensure that both public transport commuters and operators are safe as numbers increase in the region. “The entire Western Cape we are seeing the curve has flattened so we are now targeting certain areas that are concerning and this is one of those areas and with the behaviour and the adherence to the regulations it’s quite pleasing.”
