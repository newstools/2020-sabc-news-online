Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the State Security Agency (SSA) will conduct lifestyle audits on him and all MECs in the province. He was responding to allegations of corruption in the province during the weekly Gauteng Command Council briefing on the province’s coronavirus status. Makhura says the audits will be concluded in about eight weeks’ time.  From next week, the State Security Agency (SSA) will commence with lifestyle audits on myself and the 10 MEC’s in the Gauteng Provincial Govenment, as we had resolved at the start of the 6th administration. — David Makhura (@David_Makhura) August 7, 2020  “The Gauteng provincial government, for 6 years before this period had endeavored to put in place an open tender system that reduced the level of corruption and wasteful expenditure and irregular expenditure. Once COVID-19 happened, the open tender system was not being implemented. The hyenas attacked. As part of the commitment to clean governance in Gauteng, I have also committed that we will do lifestyle audits for all the members of the executive council,” says the Premier. The video below is Premier Makhura’s media briefing:  Makhura says the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has identified two health officials who allegedly enabled the PPE corruption. In recent weeks, allegations of corruption over Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tenders involving Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko drew public criticism from various sectors of society. Meanwhile, the Premier says the province’s daily infections and hospital admission have started to decline. More than 130 000 people have recovered in Gauteng, with just over 2 300 deaths. About 4 400 people are currently hospitalised in public and private facilities in the province. Makhura says there are positive signs in the fight against the virus in the province.
