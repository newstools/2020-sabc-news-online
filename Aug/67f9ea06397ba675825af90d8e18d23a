Brazil recorded 25 800 additional confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 541 deaths from the disease caused by the virus in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday. Brazil has registered more than 2.73 million cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 94 104, according to ministry data. Brazil is the country worst hit by COVID-19 outside of the United States in both death toll and case count. Sao Paulo, Brazil’s most populous and hardest-hit state, has been working through a backlog of previously unregistered cases. President Jair Bolsonaro has pressed to reopen the Brazilian economy, with lockdowns lifting in many cities despite the toll of the disease continuing to rise. In some cases, Brazilians have packed into bars and crowded public squares, often in defiance of local rules. Bolsonaro himself has flouted social distancing guidelines by joining supporters at rallies around Brasilia, the capital,in recent months. He fell ill with coronavirus in July, and spent weeks in partial isolation before recovering.
