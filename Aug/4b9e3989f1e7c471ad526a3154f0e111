The Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, will be proposing an extension of the National State of Disaster to Cabinet when it meets this afternoon. CoGTA Spokesperson Lungi Mtshali says Dlamini-Zuma will be leading the deliberations with the National Coronavirus Command Council,. “We will be proposing to Cabinet this afternoon for the extension for the national state of disaster and then we will be tabling the reasons why we feel that the state of disaster should or should not be extended,” says Mtshali. Should Cabinet agree on the proposal, this would mean the nationwide lockdown will remain in place. However, some regulations may be amended and the country may be taken to a lower alert level. “When we, move within the levels whether level three or moving to level four or moving to level two we must be still within the national state of disaster so the extension and the movement of the levels are not mutually exclusive,” says Mtshali. Government has until midnight to make a decision on the matter. Opposition parties are divided on it. While the EFF and Cope want South Africa to remain on lockdown, others including the DA and the ACDP want an end to the state of national disaster.
