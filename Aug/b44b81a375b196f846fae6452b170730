The special official Funeral for Northern Cape MEC for Education, Mac Jack, will be held on Sunday and he will be buried in Graaf Reinet, in the Eastern Cape. Jack died on Wednesday following a short stay in a Kimberley hospital where he was diagnosed with the coronavirus. “The South African Police Service presides over the funeral. We will also be adhering to strict covid-19 regulations which means that at the funeral, only a total number of 50 people will be allowed to attend. For purposes of mourners that we know would have loved to be part of the funeral, we will be streaming the proceedings live on our provincial government facebook page as well as on our provincial government youtube channel,” says the Northern Cape Premier’s Spokesperson, Bronwyn Thomas-Abrahams. In 2013, Jack was sworn in as a new member of the Provincial Legislature, deployed by the ANC. He served in Transport, Safety and Liaison MEC, Health, Finance, Economic Development, and Tourism and was MEC for Education at the time of his death.
