Consumers have welcomed Eskom’s announcement that there will be no loadshedding this weekend. The power utility also did not implement loadshedding on Friday. This comes after Eskom implemented loadshedding for the past two weeks. After recovering three generation units, Eskom says the supply constraints have eased sufficiently to allow for the suspension of loadshedding. Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says the power grid has stabilised. Mantshantsha says, “Three generators were returned to service at the Lethabo, Medupi and Kusile power stations, another unit at Kusile was taken offline for repairs. Unplanned breakdowns stand at 8 750MW of capacity, adding to the 4 500MW currently out on planned maintenance. While the supply constraints have eased for the rest of the weekend, Eskom would like to remind the public to continue using electricity sparingly as the aged generation infrastructure is unpredictable, unreliable and volatile. Any significant deterioration in the generation performance may necessitate the implementation of loadshedding at short notice.” #PowerAlert 1 As return of additional generation eases supply constraints, no loadshedding is expected for
