The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation has appealed to the government to hold senior officials accountable. In a strongly-worded statement, the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation says news of the allegations of COVID-19-related corruption did not come as a big surprise. There have been allegations of irregularities in the tender processes involving, among others, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko, Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and the sons of ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule. Justice Minister Ronald Lamola will head a Ministerial Committee that Ramaphosa has established to look into allegations of corruption. The Foundation says the fact that those who are politically connected are using corruption to get business opportunities, is a massive setback for the country. It says instead of acting against the corrupt, over the years, systems and individuals were compromised and the state and ruling party have become increasingly factionalised. It says the allegations widened the lack of trust between government, citizens and companies, who want to grow the economy. It has called on the government to act decisively and hold the culprits in its ranks accountable, regardless of who they are. Covid corruption shames South Africa, and poisons opportunity to reduce inequality. At the very time we should be demonstrating integrity, we’re blowing it… @OfficialSACC @NelsonMandela @KathradaFound @FHRRights @CASACZA Statement from @TutuLegacy here – https://t.co/30fBQIKfqV — TutuLegacy (@TutuLegacy) August 8, 2020  In the video below, Gauteng ANC asks Bandile Masuku and Khusela Diko to step aside pending probe:
