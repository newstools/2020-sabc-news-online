A forensic report on the findings into allegations of money laundering against former Botswana Presiden Ian Khama and South African businesswoman Bridgette Motsepe is being released on Wednesday afternoon. The pair was labelled as detractors of the current regime during the lead up to last year’s national elections. Khama and Motsepe were accused of financing political unrest and money laundering. In the run-up to the 2019 elections in Botswana, Motsepe had been central figure in weekly media reports. Sunday newspapers put her in the middle of a conspiracy to bring down Botswana’s current president Mokgweetsi Masisi. The articles alleged that she had been laundering money in efforts to remove Masisi, whose relationship with his predecessor, former resident Ian Khama had soured. Motsepe has refuted all allegations, saying she doesn’t understand why she is being used in a political war. The forensic report has been compiled by international law firm Omnia owned by Cherie Blair. Khama and Motsepe will also give remarks following the report’s presentation.
