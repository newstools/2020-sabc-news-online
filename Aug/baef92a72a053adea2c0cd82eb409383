Professor Lungile Pepeta will be buried on Wednesday near Bizana in the Eastern Cape. President Cyril Ramaphosa has accorded the renowned paediatric cardiologist a special provincial funeral. Pepeta died from COVID-19 related complications at a Port Elizabeth Hospital on Friday at the age of 46. At the time of his death, he was serving as Nelson Mandela University’s Health Sciences Executive Dean. At Pepeta’s memorial service in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday, member of the Council for Medical Schemes Doctor Moerane Maimane praised him for his work ethic. “Prof Pepeta epitomised what government is always talking about: empowering young people and giving them opportunities. If young people could take opportunities they have, as he did, the world would be a much better place.” Dr Aquina Thulare spoke on behalf of the national Department of Health, saying Pepeta was an inspiration to the youth, as he rose above circumstances in the rural area of Bizana in the Eastern Cape. “When Dr Pepeta passed on he had managed to lead the health sector in the most incredible way. Born in the rural EC in Bizana he was able to overcome the issues that Apartheid posed to people who were from rural communities, and he managed to reach the highest peaks in the profession that he had chosen: medicine. And we know that where he came from, the Transkei, it is one of the most deprived areas in our country,” said Thulare. Professor Pepeta was praised for his contribution to the health sector in many ways, especially his compassion and concern for the children of the Eastern Cape. He will also be remembered for setting up a medical school at the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth. Condolences for Professor Lungile Pepeta:
