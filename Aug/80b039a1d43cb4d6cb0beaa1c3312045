Ten four-by-four vehicles have been donated to the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government to bolster the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Premier Sihle Zikalala and Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu received the vehicles from Toyota South Africa at its Durban plant in Prospecton. KwaZulu-Natal has had 104 000 confirmed cases so far, while more than 10 million people have been screened. Government also announced recently that all deaths at home will be followed up to see if it could be COVID-19 cases that have gone undiagnosed. Zikalala says, “It comes in handy to focus and assist us in our programmes in rural areas, where you get a number of people who die but they die from home and they are not checked. And this will help us so that poor health care practitioners reach rural areas that are not easily accessible and ensure that all people are tested.” KZN Premier @sziks speaks on the donation by @ToyotaSA of 10 Hilux Legend 50’s that will be utilized in the fight against the #Coronavirus pandemic. #GrowingKZNTogether pic.twitter.com/dLxyXyeZVe — KZN Provincial Gov (@kzngov) August 20, 2020  The 10 Toyota Hilux Legend 50 4×4 vehicles have been donated by @ToyotaSA as part of a partnership between the private and public sector in the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic. #GrowingKZNTogether pic.twitter.com/ztzanXOvg3 — KZN Provincial Gov (@kzngov) August 20, 2020  KZN Premier @sziks , @kznhealth MEC Ms Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu and @eThekwiniM Mayor Cllr Kaunda reiceve vehicle donation by @ToyotaSA on behalf of Government. #GrowingKZNTogether pic.twitter.com/oGE3xnnYQI — KZN Provincial Gov (@kzngov) August 20, 2020
