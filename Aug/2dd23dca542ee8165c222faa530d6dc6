President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the 2020 National Women’s Day keynote address on Sunday. The address will be held virtually due to the national lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. The address will be under the global Generation Equality campaign with the theme: “Generation Equality: Realising women’s rights for an equal future.” The National Women’s Day is celebrated annually on August 9, with August referred to as Women’s Month.
