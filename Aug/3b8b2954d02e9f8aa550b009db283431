Despite a turbulent academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic and the national lockdown the matric class of 2020 will now commence writing their final examinations on November 5 and end on December the 15 this year. Exams quality assurance body, UMALUSI says despite the disruption to schooling, matrics will be tested on the whole curriculum. CEO, Dr Mafu Rakometsi says they cannot lower the quality of examinations. “What is important to note is that standards cannot be compromised despite the challenges that we’re facing. The curriculum will not be trimmed down, but we’ve got mechanisms that have always been there to ensure that no learner is advantaged or disadvantaged by the year in which they were born and that is the standardisation process that happens after the examinations.” The 2020 academic year has no doubt been the most difficult to date for pupils across South Africa. The matric class has been really affected. Matric class has mixed feelings about exams:  Psychologists are advising that pupils’ mental health must be prioritised. Matric is the culmination of 12 years of schooling. It marks the end of an era and the beginning of the next chapter in a young person’s life. But with all the joy it brings, it is undoubtedly the most stressful year for pupils. There are pressures, anxiety and endless learning. The matriculants of past decades may have thought it was tough, but nothing can compare to what the class of 2020 is going through. They have lost crucial tuition time and face an uncertain road ahead. While some have been fortunate with resources to make up for a lost time, for others it has been a major setback. Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced another closure of public schools for four weeks following mounting pressure from teachers’ unions and the public amid rising COVID-19 infections. Grade 12 learners received a one-week break. The class of 2020 has resumed classes after the one week break.
