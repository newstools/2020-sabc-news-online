Inanda, north of Durban, has recorded the highest number of rapes in the country for the 2019/2020 financial year; followed by nearby Umlazi. The latest crime statistics were presented by Police Minister Bheki Cele on Friday. During the previous period, Inanda police station recorded the highest number of sexual offences. Advocacy Manager at Women and Men Against Child Abuse Ngaa Murombedzi discusses the increase in sexual assault crimes:  Police Minister Cele says he believes that alcohol has played a role in these crimes. “Our most problematic areas here will be Umlazi and Inanda. That is what the figures are telling us they have nothing to do with the stats under lockdown; those lockdown stats will come quarterly. One other problem we found with Inanda is that most of the people they are raped coming from shebeens. Murders would go with these rapes so which means alcohol does play a role on these matters.” Bheki Cele releases the 2019/2020 crime statistics: Fighting crime in KZN KwaZulu-Natal violence monitor, Mary de Haas, says proper training and better police management could be the solution to fight the high levels of crime in the province. The 2019/2020 national crime statistics reveal the province recorded the highest number of murders in the country, with an increase of 10.6%. Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole reflects on the 2019/2020 crime statistics: De Haas says whilst socio-economic factors and unemployment could be blamed; the provincial government has neglected the issue of crime in the areas for years. “In Umlazi for example there is a problem with the courts there. There is a problem with police investigations there; those problems have not been attended to. It all boils down to management and so thing needs to be done about managers to ensure that crime intelligence does it work and detectives are properly trained. There is a problem with forensic evidence. These crime stats are a reflection of all of these things we talking about.” Below are the full crime stats for 2019/2020.
