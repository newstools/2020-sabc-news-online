The Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) says government’s decision to ban the selling of tobacco is clumsy and lacks scientific evidence. FITA submitted its papers to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein. The organisation wants the court to grant it leave to appeal a high court judgment which favoured the ban on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Supreme Court of Appeal gave FITA until today to file replying affidavit to government’s submissions. Government has submitted to the Supreme Court of Appeal that FITA has no legal standing and its application for leave to appeal should not be entertained. The association has submitted that the undeniable illicit trade does not achieve government’s  stated objective which is to save lives. In the video below, FITA appeals ban on sale of tobacco products:  It contends that smokers continue to source the ongoing supply of cigarettes and tobacco products. And that the ban cannot be shown to have the effect on the matter. It also says government’s arguments based on health hazards associated with tobacco use or smoking, are misguided. According to FITA, such health hazards cannot justify the ban of cigarettes and tobacco products sales. In the video below, FITA appeals ban of tobacco products at the Supreme Court of Appeal:
