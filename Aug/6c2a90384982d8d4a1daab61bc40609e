Senior Counsel Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi has told the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein that the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) hunger for power in the Tshwane Metro has caused irreparable harm to residents of Pretoria. Ngcukaitobi, who is representing the Gauteng government, says political parties’ fight for the control of the Metro has compromised the delivery of basic services in the metro. The Gauteng government is appealing against the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria which ruled in favour of the DA and set aside the dissolution of the Tshwane city council.  Ngcukaitobi says there is an urgent need for the government to intervene in the situation in the Metro. “The EFF and the ANC are not interested in the reinstatement. It is only the DA Councillors who constitute a minority that are raising interests. ANC and EFF constitute a majority that is not interested in the reinstatement. They accept that the council has been dysfunctional. They  accept the provincial government acted correctly when it intervened.” The Gauteng Executive Council invoked Section 139(c) of the constitution in March dissolving the Tshwane Municipal Council and putting it under administration.
