The Gauteng Coronavirus Command Council says the provincial Treasury will publish monthly reports on all Personal Protective Equipment procurements for the remainder of the coronavirus pandemic. This in the spirit of transparency as the provincial government is plagued by allegations of irregular tender processes in the matter. The Special Investigating Unit has obtained an interim court order to freeze the bank accounts of at least 40 entities implicated in the provincial department’s irregular PPE tenders. The companies include Royal Bhaca which is owned by Thandisizwe Diko, the husband of Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko. Briefing the media on Friday, Gauteng Health COO Lesiba Malotana has welcomed the SIU investigations and said the pension funds of the CFOs implicated in the matter have also been frozen. Malotana also says the Johannesburg metropole has the greatest number of COVID-19 cases followed by Ekurhuleni. #COVID19 | @GautengHealth COO Lesiba Malotana gives update on The Comprehensive Health Response #COVID19SA #GAUTENGCOVID19 pic.twitter.com/Fa6XDQMVAG — GautengGov (@GautengProvince) August 21, 2020  The Gauteng Coronavirus Command Council gives an update:
