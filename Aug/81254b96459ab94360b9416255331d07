Gcaleka visited the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro and the OR Tambo District Municipality to get first-hand experience of the reported working conditions in some hospitals. After visiting the Mthatha General and Sulenkama hospital in Qumbu, Gcaleka has conceded that ageing infrastructure, a shortage of staff and a lack of resources are hampering the delivery of basic healthcare services to the people. “What is utmostly disturbing was the state of the hospitals. At Qumbu, the situation in that hospital is terrifying and that is the report we got from the management and the workers themselves that they are actually working in scary environment. The building is dilapidated,” says Gcaleka.
