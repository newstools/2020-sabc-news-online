Naptosa’s Executive Director, Basil Manuel, says the limited number of teachers at schools is posing risks for the curriculum to be completed… “Whilst there were a limited number of learners at school, other teachers were asked to fill in and that seems to have worked in most places. However, now that we have a large cohort of kids returning, that is not going to work. That is why we need those appointments. To date we have only seen a meaningful movement in two of our nine provinces to get the replacements done on time, and that is most disconcerting.”
