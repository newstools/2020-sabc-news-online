Four suspects are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Friday for the alleged killing of three people. A 17-year-old suspect approached police on Tuesday along with members of the community, and confessed that he along with his mother and two others killed three people and buried them in the garden. The alleged victims are an elderly man who apparently had a romantic relationship with the woman, the woman’s second boyfriend and her older son. Police arrested all four suspects. They have found some bones after conducting a search at the home. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says a case of murder has been opened against the suspects. The community of Olievenhoutbosch in Pretoria says they told the police about murders at a home in the area three years ago but no action was taken. Community leader Kgomotso Khalushi says the community is concerned that the police will not properly investigate matter.
