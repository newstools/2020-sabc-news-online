Former Eskom CFO Anoj Singh has been stripped of his membership of the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA). This, after an independent committee found him guilty on 12 of the 18 charges levelled against him. Singh did not attend the disciplinary hearing in which he was charged for dishonesty, gross negligence and for breaching a number of by-laws. The charges related to his conduct while he was CFO at state-owned enterprises, Transnet and Eskom between 2012 and 2015. He was in charge of finances at Transnet when the dubious 1 064 locomotive contract was forged.
Singh was also in charge of finances at Eskom when dodgy payments were made to the likes of McKinsey, Trillian and Tegeta Resources. Singh has been ordered to pay the costs of the disciplinary hearing. In the file video below, former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba thanks Anoj Singh for stepping down from Eskom:
