Police have arrested nine suspects after a shoot-out with suspects allegedly related to taxi violence at the Tshwane District Hospital in Pretoria. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says one suspect was killed and two more are under police guard in hospital. Two police officers were also wounded and airlifted to a hospital in Johannesburg. Peters says it is unclear at this stage if the suspects are part of a family. “An eleventh suspect was not among them but was in the vicinity and found in the possession of a firearm and unlicensed ammunition. So he was arrested for the unlicensed ammunition. So all the firearms that were confiscated on the scene were four in total together with the ammunition. And they will be subjected to ballistic testing to establish any possible links to previous crimes,” explains Peters. Peters says the Provincial Task Team investigating taxi violence was on an intelligence-driven operation and was following a suspect. It is understood the suspect was at the Pathology Services to pick up a body. Peters says the suspect was with other suspects in two cars and one minibus. “It is at the Tshwane District Hospital where they managed to trace the suspect and tried to intercept two vehicles and one Quantum which they believe the suspect was in one of them and the suspects allegedly started shooting at the police. The police returned fire and three of the police members were injured. One is from Gauteng Traffic police and two are SAPS members,” adds Peters.
