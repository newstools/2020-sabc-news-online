Minister Ronald Lamola briefs media on outcomes of Cabinet meeting. President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier announced the appointment of a ministerial committee to investigate allegations of corruption related to the procurement of personal protective equipment. The committee, which comprises seven Cabinet Ministers, including the Minister of Police, Minister in the Presidency and the Finance Minister, will be headed by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola. All national and provincial government departments have been requested to this week provide the committee with all documents, company names, tender amounts and all other relevant information pertaining to the COVID19 PPE tender processes since the National State of Disaster was declared in late March.
