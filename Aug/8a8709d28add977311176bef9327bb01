The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) wants the government to increase testing, tracking and tracing those infected with COVID-19. Saftu says the current data the government is supplying is not an accurate depiction of the number of infections. The labour federation’s general-secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says, “At some point the government was testing 50 000 people in a single day and now the government turns around and says guys, we’re now testing only 12 000 people. The numbers of people discovering to be carrying the virus have now declined, but we look at it with caution because we know, if you test less people – obviously you’re going to get less numbers of people who are testing positive.” “They are no longer contact tracing. At the beginning of the campaign, it was not just about contact tracing. It was also a massive campaign of healthcare workers walking door-to-door and screening everybody. A lot of people are dying without us knowing that these people are dying from the virus,” adds Vavi. In a statement, Saftu says, “It is concerning that the massive decline in testing of citizens may give us the wrong picture and breed a false sense of security. The truth is that, unlike at the beginning of lockdown, government is no longer doing contact-tracing nor using Community Healthcare Workers to vigorously screen citizens. At the beginning of the campaign there was aggressive random testing. This is no longer happening.” SA records 162 new deaths as COVID-19 cases climb to 587 345 South Africa has recorded 3 692 new coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, bringing the total number of case to 587 345.
