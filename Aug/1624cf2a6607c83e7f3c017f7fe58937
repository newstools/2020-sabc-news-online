The Democratic Alliance (DA)  in the Eastern Cape says it will refer the procurement of infrared thermometers by the Ndlambe municipality to the Special Investigating Unit. The DA says information at hand shows the municipality paid more than R71 000 for 28 thermometers, which a local supplier could supply for less than R17 000. The DA’s Kevin Mileham says they also want to ensure that the companies doing business with municipality comply with the necessary requirements. “It is unacceptable that public funds are utilised in a poor manner so we have handed the information to the Special Investigation Unit and we will be tabling a motion to the council calling for a full investigation to companies awarded and value received by the municipality.” SABC News approached the Ndlambe Municipality for a reply on the matter. The municipality says it will reply in due course once it has gathered the relevant information. COVID-19 tender corruption is discussed in the video below:
