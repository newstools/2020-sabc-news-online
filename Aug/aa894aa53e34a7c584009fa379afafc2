Workers’ union, National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu), wants Limpopo government officials and senior politicians, fingered in the allegations of irregular awarding of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender worth over R900 million, put on special leave. It is alleged that amongst the 216 companies awarded the tenders, some belong to government officials, friends and relatives of senior politicians in government. Others apparently did not qualify for the contracts. One of the companies in the eye of the storm is based in Kwa-Zulu Natal and it was given a R180 million tender. Nehawu Limpopo Provincial Secretary Jacob Adams says the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) must investigate the allegations and those implicated must be put on special leave. “We are saying that the SIU must do their work and we are calling on the Premier of the province to act swiftly on this matter particularly on what the Gauteng provincial government has done, to put some of this officials and some of the political leaders on special leave so that through investigations can be done investigation cannot be done while people are still in office,  they must be on special leave so that proper investigations can be done.”
