The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) will be commemorating the eighth anniversary of the Marikana tragedy in Johannesburg on Sunday. It will be the first time that the commemoration will be hosted outside Marikana in the North West, where 34 mineworkers were killed after they were shot by heavily armed police officers. Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa says this year’s event will be in a small physical gathering in order to comply with lockdown regulations. “We communicated with all the structures of our union which they have agreed and we also consulted and engaged with the survivors and even the widows before. They gave us that mandate that yes, we can commemorate but in a way that it would not put us against the state, of which to us must abide with the regulations. There will be a physical commemoration limited to only 50 people.” Meanwhile, the Amcu president has lambasted mining operation Sibanye for hosting a parallel lecture to mark the 8th anniversary of the Marikana massacre. The union hosted its Marikana commemoration lecture on Friday in Johannesburg. Mathunjwa accused Sibanye of trying to take over the legacy of the Marikana tragedy with its virtual lecture. He has also called into question the conscience of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela who delivered a keynote address at the Sibanye lecture. – Additional reporting Tshepo Mongoai In the video below, Mathunjwa lashes out at Sibanye:
