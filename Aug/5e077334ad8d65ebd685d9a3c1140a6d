The State Capture Commission has postponed the testimony of the Head of the Human Settlements Department in the Free State, Nthimose Mokhesi, to a date to be determined. Mokhesi has been implicated in corruption related to a 2014 tender worth R255-million which aimed to eradicate asbestos roofs in low-cost housing in the province. He and other officials are alleged to have received money, luxury cars and property from tender recipient, joint venture company Blackhead-Diamond Hill. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo granted the application after it was explained by GVR Fouche that he was standing in for senior counsel, Advocate Mike Hellens, who has COVID-19. “In his view, he would like to see Mr Hellens remain on brief. His view is also the person who helped in throughout the draft, the affidavits, so he is the senior counsel with the knowledge at the moment and the current legal team simply does not have the knowledge to assist him sufficiently.” The Commission has been adjourned and is set to continue at 17:00.
