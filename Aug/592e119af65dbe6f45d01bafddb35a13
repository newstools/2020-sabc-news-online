The South African Weather Service says cold conditions will persist across the country on Wednesday and Thursdays following a severe cold front that made landfall on Monday. The cold front led to snow on several Western Cape mountains which has drastically dropped temperatures across the country, with weather conditions also being experienced in Gauteng. SA Weather Service Forecaster Jan Vermeulen says rainfall can also be expected in some parts of the country. Vermeulen says, “Today is going to be a cold day, with the cold front lying east of the country. But there is still some rainfall expected over the south-east coast and adjacent interior where there can also be some snowfall over the mountains of Eastern Cape. We also have a watch for high seas between Mossel Bay and Margate.” “If one looks at the temperatures JHB 0:14, PTA 2:17 and Vereeniging -2:15. There definitely is a further chance of snow. Already tomorrow there is another cold front expected.” SA Weather | Wednesday 19 August 2020 | #SABCWeather Media Release: Typical late winter weather as we move into Lockdown Level 2. pic.twitter.com/bo9Xvq4SFv — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) August 17, 2020
