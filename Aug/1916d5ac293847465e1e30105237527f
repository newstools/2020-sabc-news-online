Former Eskom executive Matshela Koko has defended himself from corruption allegations levelled against him by Eskom. The power utility and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) have instituted legal proceedings to recoup R3.8 billion from Eskom’s former executives, the Gupta brothers and associates lost due to corruption. Koko denies all allegations against him. “I don’t know what Eskom case is against me. I have not received the summons, so I look forward to receiving the summons so that I can understand what Eskom’s case is; and not only that I have not done any interview or interaction with law enforcement authorities including the SIU. I think Eskom is taking the views that say – we think you stole our money, we don’t have the evidence to get you charged, we are going to try to recover our money and hoping that in that process of recovering our money we stumble on the evidence that will get you charged. I think that’s Eskom’s case.” In the audio below is Matshela Koko responding on the allegations:  Among the 12 defendants in the case is also former Eskom Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe.
