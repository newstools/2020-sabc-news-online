North West acting MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Boitumelo Moiloa, is expected to visit the embattled Ramotshere Moiloa Local Municipality in Zeerust. This after residents protested against the electricity being cut off by Eskom. The power utility is currently cutting off power in the area for up to six hours a day, due to non-payment of its R50.7 million debt owed by the municipality. Eskom has also warned that should the municipality fail to make an upfront payment of R20 million by this Thursday, the power cuts will increase to 14 hours a day. The municipality is unable to pay Eskom and workers’ salaries, as its equitable share has been withheld by the provincial Treasury. Treasury says the grant is withheld based on non-compliance by the municipality to the Municipal Finance Management Act with relation to its annual budget. Residents are now demanding the intervention of the provincial government. A spokesperson for the residents Kagiso Booysen says, “We really want the province to pay Eskom so that the electricity cut-offs must end. Pay Eskom from whatever coffers that you have.” Power interruptions in Free State
