The Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP, is calling for the reinstatement of the death sentence for the perpetrators of serious crimes such as the murder and rape of women. Party President Velenkosini Hlabisa sounded the alarm while addressing an open-air church service in uMthwalume, on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. IFP holds prayer in uMthwalume following spate of killings in the area:  Various church denominations gathered at the notorious sugarcane fields where the bodies of six women have been discovered since 2018. Police find body of 6th woman in  sugar plantation in uMthwalume:  The IFP has joined the religious fraternity in calling for an end to the spate of gender-based violence. IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa calls on men to end gender-based violence:  Religious leader Archbishop Tholokuhle Nxumalo says men are the perpetrators of gender-based violence. “We have to talk because people who are doing these are not women, it’s actually men. We feel ashamed as men. It’s actually us who do this.” Pastor Lungile Mthethwa says society must take a stand in the fight against the scourge. “We don’t have power to fight for ourselves; we trust God to fight our battles. Men should stand up and protect us. Women should be careful and avoid walking at night on their own.” Referendum on death penalty Hlabisa says they will propose a referendum on the death penalty for those committing serious and violent crimes against women. “The IFP is going to lobby the people of South Africa in a campaign for a referendum for the government to test the opinion of the people of South Africa on death penalty. Why is the government concerned on the rights to life of a killer yet a killer does not care about the life of the innocent woman?” Two suspects arrested in connection with these killings are set to appear in the uMzumbe Magistrate’s Court in Umthwalume on Monday. They face charges related to murder and kidnapping.
