Mexico received a donation of $3 million from the United States to help fight the novel coronavirus, which has claimed more than 50 000 lives, a health official said on Friday. Mexican Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said the donation would be used for research purposes, supplies and tests. With the highly contagious virus spreading rapidly across the region, Lopez-Gatell told reporters “the pandemic will be prolonged.”
