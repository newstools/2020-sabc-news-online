Public Works and Infrastructure Minister, Patricia De Lille, says her department is in the process of tightening spending procedures. This after opposition parties including the Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters and Freedom Front Plus accused her of lacking control over spending in her department. An investigation found that the fence at the Beitbridge border post between South Africa and Zimbabwe cost R40.4 million which comprised R37.1 million payment to the contractor and R3.25 million to a professional agent.  It was overpriced by R14 million. De Lille has since suspended the director-general Sam Vukela and the acting director-general Imtiaz Fazel.

I do also want to say to the public that if any of them has got any information, about corruption in my department, like with the leases or anything, send that information to me because corruption is about stealing from the poor and we all have the responsibility to root out corruption.” In the video below, Minister Patricia de Lille speaks to Morning Live:
