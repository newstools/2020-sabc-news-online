U.S. President Donald Trump accused Democrats of wanting to “steal the election” on Saturday (August 8), a day after Congressional Democrats and the White House could not reach an agreement on an economic aid bill. Trump made the claim after Democrats’ proposed $3.4 trillion coronavirus aid package included several measures which they said would enhance the security of the upcoming election. “The bill also requires all states to do universal mail in balloting, which nobody is prepared for,” Trump told reporters at a news conference at his property in Jew Jersey. In recent weeks, Trump has said without evidence that a surge in mail-in voting would lead to widespread voter fraud and suggested the election be delayed. The idea was immediately rejected by Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who have sole authority to change the election date. Trump, who opinion polls show trailing Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden, said he would not trust the results of an election that included widespread mail voting – a measure that many observers see as critical given the coronavirus pandemic.
