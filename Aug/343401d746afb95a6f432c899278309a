A taxi driver has been arrested for the murder of a Cape Town traffic officer. 46-year-old Deon Sampson was checking the license disc of a taxi waiting at a roadblock in Khayelitsha on Friday night, when the driver accelerated, ran him over and dragged him along the road for nearly 200 metres. It is reported that other officers chased after the vehicle, but the driver refused to stop. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says they had to shoot several times at the vehicle before the driver was eventually apprehended off Oscar Mpetha Drive. “What happened to Officer Sampson is horrific and I call on the South African Police (SAPS) to expedite this investigation so that justice can be served. The city extends its condolences to Officer Sampson’s spouse and his three children and his extended family as well as the colleagues in the traffic department. It cuts deep when we lose one of our own, but even more so when the circumstances are as incomprehensible as what transpired last night.” The suspect is expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday.
