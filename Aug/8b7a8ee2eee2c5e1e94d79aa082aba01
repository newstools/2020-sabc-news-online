Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says South Africans, irrespective of their political affiliations, have made government’s achievements possible in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He was speaking in a virtual debate on the Disaster Management Tax Relief as well as Disaster Management Tax Relief Administration bills. The National Assembly passed the so-called two COVID-19 Tax bills which will now be sent to the National Council of Provinces for concurrence. Mboweni introduced the bills in June in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country’s economy. He highlighted the importance of working as a collective. Mboweni says, “We announced a massive intervention programme to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. What we needed to do to restart, to reboot the economy, and I am pleased to say that the collaboration between the Ministry of Finance and the Departments of Health has been very productive and helpful to all of us, such that I think that we have managed to bend the curve of infections, deaths, improving recoveries. And we have done all this because we have been working together as South Africans despite our different political positions.” In the video below, Treasury, SARS brief Finance Committee on Disaster Management bill: PricewaterhouseCoopers Tax Leader, Kyle Mandy speaks about COVID-19 tax relief measures during lockdown:
