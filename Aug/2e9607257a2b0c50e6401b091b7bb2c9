The Health Ministry says it has become aware of a message that has appeared on several social media platforms, claiming that the Minister of Health, Dr. Zweli Mkhize, owns a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) manufacturing company. The department says it would like to state that Minister Mkhize does not own a PPE manufacturing company nor is he involved in any way in the manufacturing of PPE. The Department adds that nobody in Mkhizeâ€™s family is in the business of manufacturing, selling or distribution of PPEs. It says creating or advancing fake news remains an offense under the National State of Disaster and the Department of Health will not hesitate to take action against those found to be creating or perpetuating fake news. In the statement, Dr. Mkhize denies the allegations.
