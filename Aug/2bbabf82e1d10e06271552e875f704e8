The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg is on Wednesday morning scheduled to hear the testimony of the former head of the Free State Human Settlements Department, Nthimose Mokhesi. He has been implicated in corruption related to a 2014 tender worth R255 million to eradicate asbestos in the province. He and other officials are alleged to have received money, luxury cars and property from tender recipient, joint venture company Blackhead-Diamond Hill. According to a spreadsheet prepared by Diamond Hill owner, the late Igo Mpambani, various people were paid bribes. The Commission’s evidence leader Paul Pretorious says, “An amount of R650 000 is paid via a trust to attorneys which is used to buy a property which it is apparent to investigators is where Mr. Mokesi lives but the explanation of Mokesi is that no this is a joint business venture. He and Mr. Sodi became friends and they decided to invest in a property but what is significant here is that a person who is involved in the grant of a tender of R255 million, the accounting officer, should not be involved in business with the recipient.” In the video below is Tuesday’s hearing:
