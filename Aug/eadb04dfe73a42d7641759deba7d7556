A councillor in the King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape has denied reports that he has been fired for alleged fraud and corruption. Mbongeni Mabaso says he has not received any letter of dismissal. This after the Eastern Cape Co-operative Governance Department confirmed reports that he had been fired after selling an RDP house to a community member. Mabaso is also accused of involvement in corruption related to food parcels. The department’s Spokesperson Makhaya Komisa says community members say he has been favouring his political associates and friends in the distribution of the food parcels. “Mabaso has failed to submit representation to the Honourable MEC about allegations levelled against him. The MEC has removed Mr Mabaso in terms of Section 14 (6) of the Code of Conduct applicable to councillors. He is the seventh councillor to be removed by the MEC for failing to adhere to the Municipal Systems Act in the province.”
