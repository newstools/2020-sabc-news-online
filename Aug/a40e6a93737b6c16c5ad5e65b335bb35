Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize is on a  two-day visit to KwaZulu-Natal ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic reaching an expected peak in the province in the coming weeks. The National Health Department has said, in a statement, Mkhize will be visiting a few COVID-19 facilities across the province to better understand the challenges they face. This follows a sharp rise in new cases in KwaZulu-Natal over the past weeks. Mkhize is expected to hand over a COVID-19 site at the Richmond Hospital in the Midlands on Thursday, before addressing the media later in Durban.
