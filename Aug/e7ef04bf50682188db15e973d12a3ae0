Political analyst, Mcebisi Ndletyana says the letter written by former President Jacob Zuma to President Cyril Ramaphosa, was aimed at thwarting his anti-corruption campaign.

Zuma said Ramaphosa lacks leadership and the letter is fundamentally flawed in many aspects. Ndletyana says the letter was strategically sent in the lead up to this weekend’s NEC meeting. “That response was actually meant to rally the troops within the NEC in preparation for this weekend’s meeting. This is because Zuma’s faction are obviously implicated in corruption and they knew that Cyril’s [Ramaphosa] letter was pretty much aimed at them mainly against Magashule and everybody associated with him.
