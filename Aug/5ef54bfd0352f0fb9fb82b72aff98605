President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed Dovhani Mamphiswana, Director-General of the Public Service Commission, on precautionary suspension with immediate effect. The President delegated to the Minister of Public Service and Administration the power to investigate if there was any improper conduct during the filling of a vacancy within the Department. The instruction to probe the allegations against Dr Mamphiswana, came in January this year after a Sunday newspaper reported that Mamphiswana had allegedly chaired a panel which recommended the appointment of the mother of his child as a chief director for professional ethics. A report on the investigation was then presented to the President and recommended formal disciplinary action against Mamphiswana. It is alleged that he used his influence to appoint the mother of his child to a senior position.
