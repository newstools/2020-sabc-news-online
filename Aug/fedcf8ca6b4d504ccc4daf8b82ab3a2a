The State Capture Commission will on Friday hear testimony from the former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Free State Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Seipati Dhlamini. Her testimony relates to the multi-million rand Estina dairy project in Vrede. The initiative was established to benefit emerging farmers but the money to establish the farm instead ended up in the pockets of the Gupta family. On Thursday, two former Transnet bodyguards took the stand. They told the commission that some Transnet executives carried large sums of cash and frequented the Gupta compound. One of the bodyguards to former Transnet CEO, Brian Molefe related how he once found a backpack belonging to Molefe filled with bundles of R200 notes. “I said, I think it is a security risk to carry such an amount. If we were to be stopped at a roadblock the cops will ask us about this and also we might be mugged and he was very upset with my comment and he said it’s none of my business what is in his bag,” explains the bodyguard.
