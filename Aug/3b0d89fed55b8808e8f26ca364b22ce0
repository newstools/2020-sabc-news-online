The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) says the African National Congress (ANC) infighting in the Northern Cape is impacting negatively on service delivery in the province. The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has in the past week embarked on an oversight programme and held meetings with provincial departments and municipalities from all over the country. The FF+ has accused the ruling party of failing to dissolve the Pokwane Local Municipality after it didnâ€™t adopt a budget by the end of July 2019. In a statement, FF+ Spokesperson on Cooperative Governance Michal Groenewald says this is despite the provincial Cogta department confirming that it had intervened and gave a conditional approval of a budget for the municipality. Groenewald says the law does not make provision for a conditional approval of the budget. He says the Pokwane council had, therefore, been allowed to act illegally from July 2019 to March 2020 when it was eventually dissolved. He says all the expenses incurred based on any of the council decisions made during this time are irregular expenditure. He added that the Pokwane community has been burdened with the far-reaching consequences of poor service delivery, brought about by political infighting. The FF+ says it will send a request to the Auditor-General to thoroughly investigate the Pokwane Municipality so that appropriate action can be taken against the individuals responsible for the state of affairs at the Municipality.
