Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has confirmed that all those occupying senior positions in government will undergo lifestyle audits. He has embarked on an anti-corruption drive in the province. The province has been inundated with allegations of corruption relating to coronavirus tenders. In July, Mabuyane welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s move to authorise the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to probe the alleged looting of COVID-19 funds. Mabuyane says he believes that the lifestyle audits are necessary. “The lifestyle audit will be conducted on the Premier, MECs, DG, DDGs, HODs, CFOs, and all chief directors or any senior person in supply chain management units in the provincial administration. In the long run, this will also accommodate the municipal space. I know that there’s work being done from relevant authorities to ensure that we deal with this issue holistically,” adds the Premier. ‘Prima facie case’ In recent weeks, some top government officials have been criticised for their involvement in the PPE tenders. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, addressing parliament last week, said there is a prima facie case to be made for probing the awarding of some tenders for COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). He added that law enforcement agencies must take action.
