The South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande says they are unhappy with a government loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved R70 billion loan to the South African government. More than 70 countries have received financial assistance from the IMF to help in efforts to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SACP believes that the loan exposes the country’s economy to what it says is ‘imperialists interest’. The loan will help mitigate the social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. SACP has described the move as a “grievous mistake”.
