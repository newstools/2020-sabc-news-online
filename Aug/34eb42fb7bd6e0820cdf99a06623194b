The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Mangaung Metro has hailed the removal of Executive Mayor Olly Mlamleli as a victory. The opposition party’s Mangaung Caucus leader Hardie Viviers says this is the beginning of a clean-up in the Metro. Mlamleli was removed through a secret ballot vote on a motion of no confidence at a special council meeting held until late Friday evening. The latest motion was preceded by two failed motions of no confidence where voting was done by show of hands. Viviers says: “Today Olly Mlamleli has gone. Since 2016 our slogan has been Olly must go and she must be held accountable. Indeed, it’s a victory for all councillors in the Mangaung Metro today and for our community. The next step is to do the same with the administrative head.”
