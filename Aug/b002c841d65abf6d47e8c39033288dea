The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg will hear evidence related to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) when Judge Tintswalo Makhubele takes the stand on Monday. Makhubele is accused of interfering in litigation between PRASA and a contractor, Siya Rail Solutions. In 2019, activist group UniteBehind laid a complaint with the Judicial Services Commission accusing her of gross misconduct while she was the chairperson of the Prasa interim board. Makhubele is also alleged to have improperly held a dual status positions when she acted as a Judge of the High Court of Gauteng while also serving as Chairperson of Prasa. The judge failed to appear last month at the commission. Makhubele had sent her legal representatives to request a postponement. She had also cited various other reasons why she could not appear including that her car had lost control due to a tyre bust. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo had expressed concern and said the judge had several months to prepare. He added that her lack of appearance had caused great inconvenience for the Commission. Law enforcement agencies Last week, former Police Minister Nathi Nhleko assumed the hot seat. He denied that he interfered with the work of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) in the matter of the rendition of Zimbabwean citizens in 2010. Nhleko detailed how he had set up a reference group to probe the illegal repatriation of five Zimbabwean nationals by senior hawks officials and how it was investigated by the IPID. In April 2019, former IPID Head Robert McBride told the commission that Nhleko illegally suspended him and former Hawks Head Anwar Dramat and two of his colleagues Shadrack Sibiya and Lesley Maluleke for their involvement in the rendition.
