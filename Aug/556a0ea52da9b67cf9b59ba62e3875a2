The State Capture Commission in Johannesburg hears evidence from Judge Tintswalo Makhubele who had this week pushed for a postponement of her hearing. The Judge failed to testify on the 24th of last month claiming she was traumatised after her carâ€™s tyre burst. On Monday the Judge again sought a postponement claiming she had not consulted with her new legal team. She claimed there was a malicious campaign against her. Makhubele has been implicated by various witnesses for alleged wrong doing during her tenure as board chair at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA). She is also alleged to have pushed for controversial tender deals at PRASA.
