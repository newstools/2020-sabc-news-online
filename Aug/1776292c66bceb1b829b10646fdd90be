The KSE Kraaifontein Old Age Home in Cape Town has confirmed that they currently have 23 residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19).  This has raised concerns from the local community. The Western Cape Department of Social Development has however stated that the facility was assessed and had the necessary protocols in place.  The Facility Manager, Hawa Khan, says some of their 135 elderly residents, especially those with dementia, refuse to wear masks. She says they have separate staff members, with full personal protective equipment (PPE) working with the residents who have tested positive. “For the staff when they come in in the morning they get screened with the infrared thermometer for their temperature and their hands get sanitised as they walk in the gates. And when they enter at the front door there’s another sanitiser where they sign-in on the register for what time they arrived at work.  Then they go to the different cubicles that they’re assigned to take care of the various residents.” New COVID-19 related deaths South Africa has recorded 286 new COVID-19 related deaths bringing the death toll to 11 556. This while the number of infections has increased by 6 275 in the last 24-hour cycle bringing the cumulative number of infections to 579 140.
