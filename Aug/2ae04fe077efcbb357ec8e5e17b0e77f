Trial runs for the country’s first digital census begin on Monday in selected areas. Statistics South Africa says the Census 2021 Trial, will continue until September 6, 2020. Statistician-General and Head of Stats SA Risenga Maluleke and his team selected areas around the country that will be tested. Census 2021 is the first population count to introduce digital census-taking using online and telephonic data. This will allow respondents to complete the census questionnaire on their own. The telephonic data collection makes provision for respondents to participate in the census with the assistance of a Stats SA call center agent. According to StatsSA, this method will ensure that more people participate as the challenge of reaching hard to access communities will be minimised. Participating in the Census 2021 Trial requires respondents to register through a platform that is available on Stats SA online and social media platforms. Respondents may also contact Stats SA via the toll-free number – 0800 110 248 for further assistance. #Census2021 Trial from 10 August to 06 Sept 2020 in selected areas across the country. Participate and help #StatsSA prepare for online and telephonic data collection in the upcoming census.
