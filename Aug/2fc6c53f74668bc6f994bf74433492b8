WATCH NOW: Moshe Motlohi, GM: Port of Durban, unpacks the participants, plans and progress of the Port of Durban Decongestion Task Team, which is tackling traffic pressure and congestion in the port’s Bayhead Precinct and surrounding road networks. https://t.co/QaloQYJQ5U — Transnet NPA (@TransnetNPA) July 28, 2020  General Manager at the Port of Durban, Moshe Motlohi says there have been a series of events in the area including an overturned truck. “That was subsequently followed by the system failure in one of the privately-owned terminals in Island View which has further slowed the operations and took the truck congestion crew longer. As we were getting out of that as fate would have it there was now an industrial relation activity within the same operation where wage negotiations led to some withdrawal of labour by a union that further made the situation to be worse,” adds Motlohi.
