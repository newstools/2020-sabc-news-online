Small rural towns in the Western Cape that depend on tourism for their survival are itching to get their economies up and running. With the relaxed travel restrictions under Level 2 lockdown, they are looking to cash in on the cold weather currently gripping the province. One such town is Uniondale that was turned into a winter wonderland after snowfalls earlier this week. Unionadale hoping snowfall in the are will boost tourism:  Influx of visitors Following months of lockdown woes, the town was buzzing this week. The snow, which coincided with lockdown Level 2, brought an influx of visitors. “We saw the snow on the news in Uniondale and we thought we had to go see it.
