Gauteng Premier David Makhura has dismissed as fake news allegations about the involvement of his family in Personal Protective Equipment procurement. In a statement, his office says neither his wife nor his children are doing business with the government. “The allegations are false and will not pass scrutiny. The same social media post makes allegations about an inappropriate relationship (“side chick”) between the Premier and the official who has resigned from the Department of Health. These are unfounded and baseless allegations.” The Gauteng government says the allegations are a smear campaign aimed to turn attention away from those who benefitted from PPE corruption. “We will not be deterred in our fight against corruption. All those found guilty of any wrongdoing will face the full might of the law. All the crooks must face a jail term as a true reflection of our seriousness about fighting corruption. “ Premier Makhura will, on a personal basis, open a case and pursue legal action against those responsible for generating and spreading the allegations.
