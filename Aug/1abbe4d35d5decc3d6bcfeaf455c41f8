The Sol Plaatje municipality and a Kimberley resident are in a dispute over a grave. Raymond Louw says the municipality was supposed to remove remains buried in his brother’s grave in June last year. This is seven years after Louw’s brother, Richard was buried in the grave. A new tombstone has also been erected. Raymond Louw says the Sol Plaatje municipality in Kimberley has been sending him from pillar to post. This after they made a mistake that they should have rectified a long time ago. “I found that my brother’s tombstone was removed from his grave. I consulted the workers of the municipality and asked them what’s happening there. They told me that we’ve put the tombstone on a wrong grave and then they promised me to open the grave where the tombstone is and they found the casket beneath and it was Mr Mokalaka, then they closed it again. They opened the next grave and then we found the casket of Mr Semau on top of my brother they buried the lady who’s Keitumetse Koloane, we are not related” The Sol Plaatje Municipality has apologised to the family. It says the delay is as a result of the other family’s unreasonable demands before their body can be exhumed. The municipality opted for the legal route. Louw says Keitumetse Koloane was supposed to have been buried in Semau’s grave. “What I want to see happen is they must take the body of Keitumetse on top of my brother and put it in the right grave where she belongs but till today there’s nothing, from December the 5th till today.” The municipality was unable to say when exactly the matter will be resolved. Louw is now asking the municipality to do the right thing so that his brother can finally rest in peace.
