Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has reassured the public that they will be treated under dignified and safe conditions in hospitals as the country fights COVID-19. Mkhize was responding to the death of 67-year-old Sibusiso Khumalo in a makeshift structure outside the Pietermaritzburg’s Northdale Hospital. Khumalo’s family shared a video expressing disappointment about the condition of the makeshift facility where he was being treated. Mkhize welcomed the suspension of two officials at the hospital. “Where was the provincial management when that thing happened? So, we will actually get to the bottom of this issue so that our people are safe. By the way, when the issue arose, we had already asked the MEC to prove before it was in the media. The point about it, we want to assure our people, we will do everything to make sure they are treated under conditions of dignity and safety and issues such as North Dale, we will ensure they are corrected.” The family is demanding answers on why Khumalo was admitted to a cold, makeshift structure in the hospital parking lot. Khumalo had been complaining of chest pains and had trouble breathing since last week. He was admitted to the Northdale Hospital on Friday and taken in a wheelchair to the makeshift structure outside the hospital. In the video below, the Khumalos are demanding answers:
