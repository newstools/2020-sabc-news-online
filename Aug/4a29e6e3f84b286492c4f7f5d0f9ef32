The Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA), says it will continue with its legal battle against government over the banning of tobacco sales during the national lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the ban on tobacco sales will be lifted under alert level two of the nationwide lockdown which kicks off at midnight on Monday. Alcohol sales will also be permitted under level two of the lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the nation on Lockdown Level 2: FITA says even though the ban has been lifted, the industry had suffered great loses while the ban was on place. FITA Chairperson Sinenhlanhla Mnguni says the industry is not yet safe. President Ramaphosa’s address follows various meetings with the National Coronavirus Command Council and cabinet. “Restrictions on the sale of Tobacco will be lifted. The suspension of the sale of alcohol
will be lifted subject to certain restriction. Alcohol will be permitted for onsite consumption in licensed establishments only up to 10 PM.” “Liquor  outlets will be allowed to sell alcohol for off-site  consumption from Monday  to Thursday during the hours of 9 AM to  5 PM only. Restrictions on family and social visits will also be lifted, – although everyone is urged to exercise extreme caution and undertake such visits that are necessary.” Economic reaction to President Ramaphosa’s address on moving SA to Level 2 Lockdown:
