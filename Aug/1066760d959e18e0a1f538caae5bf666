We don’t have a shortage of kits right now. We phone every day to check what has happened. Right now, no one has got an extra specimen to test. We are now waiting for patients to come in and we don’t have as many patients as we have had in the past month or two simply because there are fewer people getting the infection,” says Mkhize.
