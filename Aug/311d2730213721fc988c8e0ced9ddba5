The director of Wise 4 Africa Brenda Madumise says they will write a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask why the Hawks arrested a woman who is facing charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. Madumise attended the brief appearance of the 40-year-old Norma Gigaba in the Hatfield Magistrate’s Court in Pretoria on Monday morning. The video below showing a car that was allegedly damaged by Gigaba, went viral on social media last week.

Gigaba is the wife of former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba. Madumise says it is totally unacceptable for law enforcement that is tasked with priority crimes to handle what appears to be a domestic issue which local police could have dealt with. “If South Africans are not outraged and enraged by that, then we are in trouble. So we are planning to write to the State President [Cyril Ramaphosa] of this country to explain to us why the Hawks [are involved] in this matter to settle or even address a domestic issue that really warranted the police to act on it, not the Hawks,” adds Madumise. In the video below, SABC News’ Patricia Visagie gives an update from the Hatfield Magistrate’s Court:  Her case has been postponed to the 14th of next month in the Hatfield Magistrate’s Court in Pretoria.
