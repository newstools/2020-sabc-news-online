A joint effort by law enforcement officials and farmers from the Kingsley area in Utrecht in northern KwaZulu-Natal has led to the arrest of seven suspects. Police Spokesperson Thembeka Mbele says the suspects pretended to be officials from the Health Department when they entered a farm in the area. She says the suspects are expected to appear in the Utrecht Magistrate’s Court on charges of attempted house robbery and possession of firearms and ammunition. It’s alleged that on the 3rd of August at about 12h30, four people entered a farm in Kingsley pretending to be from the Department of Health. Two women were wearing nurses’ uniforms and when they were questioned about their visit, they drew firearms and demanded cash. The owners were suspicious and alerted police. Police officers arrested the suspects as they fled from the scene. Another vehicle with three occupants was spotted within the farm premises and they sped off when they saw police. Three men were further apprehended and a total of seven suspects were arrested and two pistols and ammunition were recovered. They will be charged for attempted house robbery as well as possession of firearms and ammunition.
