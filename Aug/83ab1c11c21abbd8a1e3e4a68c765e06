South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) has awarded all journalists in the country with 2020 Nat Nakasa Award for their brave reporting on the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement coincided with the airing of a documentary commissioned to commemorate the vital role journalists play in society. Sanef says the acknowledgement of journalists is also to honour their on-going dedication to promote an informative and free press. The forum’s new chairperson, Sbu Ngalwa says it makes perfect sense to recognise journalists as they are doing a sterling job in their reporting on the virus. “Since the declaration of the coronavirus pandemic in March. Journalists have been working under harsh conditions, dangerous conditions. They have been at the fore front, telling South Africans stories of the coronavirus. And we have also lost some colleagues and also seeing colleagues go off work, have the entire section quarantined or colleagues isolating as the result of the coronavirus, but that did not stop us from doing the work that we do.” Sanef will be celebrating the award with the screening of a documentary that celebrates journalist. SABC News will air the docie on Sunday morning, at 9am. Earlier on Saturday, Ngalwa was elected as the new chairperson of Sanef after the forum’s Annual General Meeting. He takes over from former chair, Mahlatse Mahlase, who is now the new secretary- general. Adriaan Basson is the new deputy chairperson whilst Nwabisa Makunga has been elected as the treasurer.
