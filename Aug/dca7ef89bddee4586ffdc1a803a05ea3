Three women have been arrested and charged with fraud for allegedly selling fake jobs in the Johannesburg, CBD. Police were alerted to the scam by another woman, who informed them that she had paid for an advertised job and never heard back. Johannesburg Metro Police (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minaar says police tracked down the trio at a nearby building where they found several CV’s, fake job application documents and a substantial amount of cash. Minaar says, “JMPD officers were on patrol in the Johannesburg CBD when they received a complaint from a member of the public that she had paid R450 to people who had promised her employment but then just disappeared and their phones were also off. However, she knew that they were working from the seventh floor from a building at the corner of Nugget street.” “When officers went into the building, there was one female who tried to run away, however was arrested together with two other individuals. Officers found in their possession dozens of CV’s and dozens of application forms.” Wayne Minaar on selling of JMPD jobs
