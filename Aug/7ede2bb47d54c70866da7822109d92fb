The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is set to resume on Tuesday morning with testimony into allegations of corruption in the Free State government. John Matlakala, the Director of Supply Chain Management in the provincial department of Human Settlements, is expected to testify. The Commission will also hear from Jacobus Roets who is an asbestos expert. Judge’s postponement bid denied On Tuesday, Judge Tintswalo Makhubele was denied another postponement by the Commission’s Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Zondo expressed concern about the reasons for seeking the postponement, saying the judge had several months to prepare. Tintswalo has been implicated by various witnesses for alleged corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Makhubele failed to appear before the Commission in July. She is expected to continue with her testimony on Wednesday.
