Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday described as a new phenomenon the possible re-infection of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In July, a Durban doctor reported having a COVID-19 patient who has been re-infected three months after her initial infection. It is believed the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is monitoring this case. The Health Minister says that this is not happening frequently. He was speaking during his media briefing. “This is a new phenomenon and from where we have been observing it is happening it’s not a frequent phenomenon but it’s something that we have to learn about what has happened in this case.” Mkhize says researchers must try and track those that have been re-infected and compare with what is happening in the world and possibly find lessons that can be gathered from the process. “There are a few instances and we have said that our researchers must try and track them so that we can compare with what is happening in the world and also find out whether there are any lessons that we can get out of that process and all we can say is that its not a frequent occurrence and whether this has to do with the antibodies that are short-lasting in the body we cant tell. Whether it has to do with the severity of the initial infection that it might have been mild and come back again no one really knows for a fact what the situation is. I think with time it will be clarified.” Vaccine update Mkhize says that while it is still early days they have undertaken to get involved and invest in the development of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). “Currently we are participating in the ChAdOx-1 study and in the COVAX project to be part of the global research initiatives as well as the access to vaccine programmes, ” the minister said.
