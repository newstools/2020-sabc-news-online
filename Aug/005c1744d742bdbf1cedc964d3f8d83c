President Cyril Ramaphosa says the curfew, limitations on religious gatherings and funerals are some of the restrictions that will remain in place. This comes as the country moves from level 3 to level 2 of the lockdown effectively from midnight on Monday. Ramaphosa was addressing the nation on Saturday night on government’s risk adjusted strategy of level 2. He announced the lifting of the total ban on the sale of tobacco. He also lifted the suspension on the sale of alcohol with restrictions. “As we ease restrictions, -it is necessary that some measures remain in place to limit transmission and protect our health capacity. Therefore, current restrictions on international travel will remain in place. No gatherings of more than 50 people will be permitted. Among others, these includes funerals and religious events. Spectators will not be permitted at sporting events. The curfew will remain in place between the hours of 10PM and 4AM. We continue to encourage people to stay at home if they can, and if possible, to continue to work from home, especially if they are over the age of  60 or have underlying conditions,” Ramaphosa said while elaborating on other restrictions, including international travel under level 2 lockdown.
