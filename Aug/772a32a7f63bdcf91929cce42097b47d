President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent a message of condolences to King Goodwill Zwelithini, following the death of his brother Prince Mandla Zulu. He was a royal prince of the eYibindini Royal House of King Solomon. The prince, who was a National Executive Committee member of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), died on Wednesday at the age of 45 following a short illness. In a statement, Ramaphosa says his thoughts and prayers are with the family. “My heart goes out to His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini and the royal household at the passing of an outstanding leader and community builder at such a youthful age; a passing that compounds the grief already experienced by the royal family in recent weeks,” says Ramaphosa. The royal household has in recent weeks suffered the passing of three other senior members. These are princesses, Nobuhle and Busi, from the Mbelebeleni royal house in KwaMashu and Queen Noloyiso Sandile who was the Queen Regent of the AmaRharabe kingdom in the Eastern Cape.
