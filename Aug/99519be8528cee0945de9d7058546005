African National Congress (ANC) veteran Derek Hanekom says he feels vindicated by the Constitutional Court ruling which confirmed that former President Jacob Zuma had defamed him. He says although he has accepted Zuma’s apology for a defamatory tweet he posted, he still wants Zuma to pay him R500 000  for damage caused to his reputation. On Sunday, Zuma tweeted an apology to Hanekom and deleted a tweet calling him a “known enemy agent” following a lawyer’s letter warning him that he was in contempt of court. pic.twitter.com/wO52cdiSPM — Jacob G Zuma (@PresJGZuma) August 9, 2020  On Friday, the Constitutional Court had dismissed with costs Zuma’s bid to overturn an earlier ruling by the Durban High Court ordering him to delete the remark and apologise on his twitter account. In the video below, the High Court orders Zuma to apologise:  Hanekom says this has been long overdue. “The apology was done in a way that apart from the additional work it was required of him and that was a court ruling, he had to issue an apology and remove the tweet and the third one there’s an interdict prohibiting him from any further suggestion that I might be an apartheid spy or an enemy agent, the court found what he had said was untrue and defamatory but nonetheless he issued the apology and I decided to accept the apology.   “
