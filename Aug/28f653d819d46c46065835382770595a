Villagers from NcuNteni at KwaBhaca in the Eastern Cape have held a march to the homestead of Chief Thandisizwe Diko over what they say is long term ill-treatment by the Chief. Diko is the husband of embattled Presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko. The community has accused the Chief of taking water tanks donated to the community, blocking access roads that go via his homestead, and of prohibiting them from accessing a social development facility erected in his yard. Diko is currently under investigation after being embroiled in a R125 million PPE tender scandal.
