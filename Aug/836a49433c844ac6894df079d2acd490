The African National Congress (ANC) has reiterated that it is serious about rooting out corruption. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa penned a letter to ANC members, conceding that the governing party is deeply implicated in corruption allegations. He has urged members facing corruption allegations to step aside from their duties while their cases are being heard. ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule, has also requested that his colleagues declare their financial interests and any pending police investigations. This follows a decision by the National Executive Committee (NEC) that the party’s officials oversee an audit of members facing charges or disciplinary cases. ANC Spokesperson, Pule Mabe says: “The letter written out by the President is consistent with what was expressed by the NEC. This is just a demonstration that we are quite serious about dealing with the rot of corruption. Before the president could write this letter, the SG conveyed a memo on the declaration of interests by ANC leaders and MPs and councilors, so we can begin to know the kinds of financial interests our cadres have got.” In the audio below is ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe
