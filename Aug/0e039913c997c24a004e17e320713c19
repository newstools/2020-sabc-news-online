The Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) says it is disappointed that government has decided to reopen most of the sectors of the community except initiation schools. Under lockdown Level 2, initiation practices are still prohibited. Contralesa president, Chief Mathupa Mokoena, says they have now decided to consult the Kings and Queens of different tribes to decide on the way forward as the government is not consulting them on what to do. Mokoena says, “All we have decided to do now as the Contralesa leadership because we are now on our own, they can open gyms and all these other sectors but forget about us, we’re taking this issue to the owners who are our Kings and Queens, our traditional leadership, the leadership of Contralesa and all the NGO’s and sectors who support this practice, to tell us what must we do now because the summer season is around the corner and what’s going to happen since nobody is saying anything about us, it means we’re on our own” Contralesa disappointed that under Lockdown Level 2, initiation practices are still prohibited  Under Lockdown Level 2 initiation practices are still prohibited.
