The KwaZulu-Natal Agriculture Department has spent close to R14 million replacing more than 23 vehicles that have allegedly been lost in hijacking and theft incidents in the last two years. In one incident last year, eight armed men allegedly entered the department’s offices in Ndwedwe, held up security guards, and drove away with eight state vehicles. MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi says theft is hampering service delivery. “We are also responding to the number of vehicles that have been stolen from our department and has made the lives of our extension advisory officers difficult to move around to advise our community we distributed for all eleven districts we have in the metro. We’ll need more than what we’re offering, the whole project has cost us about R14 million.”
