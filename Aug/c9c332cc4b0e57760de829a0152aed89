The trial of the former deputy North West deputy police commissioner William Mpembe and his three co-accused on charges of defeating the ends of justice continues in Mahikeng on Monday morning. They are accused of having lied about the circumstances around the death of one of the 34 mine workers who were killed by police in Marikana during the August 2012 unprotected strike by Lonmin employees. Modisaotsile Sagalala was allegedly reported to have died in hospital, while it emerged later that he died in police custody of gunshot wounds. In their statement, police had recorded that Sagalala died with the other 34 mine workers at the Marikana koppie on the 16th of August, 2012.
