The President of the Abahlali Basemjondolo Movement, Sbu Zikode, says the ANC’s decision to redeploy former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede to the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature shows that the governing party has lost touch with the needs of South Africans. Gumede is currently facing charges of fraud and corruption related to a multi-million-rand waste removal tender scandal. Her redeployment has been met with criticism by political parties and civil organisations. Various quarters have criticised the KZN ANC’s decision to redeploy Zandile Gumede to the provincial legislature. The video below explains why the former mayor was redeployed:  Earlier this week, she caused a stir when during a television interview she said there is no South Africa without the ANC. Zikode says that even while she was Mayor, Gumede lied to society’s most vulnerable. “During her leadership, service delivery was compromised, refuse has been piling up in all townships and of course diseases associated with the failure of the municipality to collect waste has really increased. During her tenure, Zandile used to lie to shack dwellers. She lied to elderly people who are living with disability. There was a time when she asked to convene a meeting so that she could give blankets to the elderly and people living with disability – Mom Zandile failed to show up.” “So, we believe that the people of KZN deserve a better leader. It shows that the ANC does not put the people of KZN and South Africa first.”
