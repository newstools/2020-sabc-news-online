Zimbabwean opposition party, the MDC Alliance, claims it has been snubbed by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Special Envoys to that country. Sydney Mufamadi and Baleka Mbete were scheduled to meet party leaders on Sunday but the meeting was cancelled. The envoys were tasked by the President to meet with all relevant parties in relations to recent allegations of human rights violations, including police brutality in Zimbabwe.
