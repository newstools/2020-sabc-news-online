Parliament’s Ad hoc Committee on the Appointment of the Auditor General has shortlisted eight candidates for the position. Those shortlisted are: Edmond Shoko-Lekhuleni, Michael Sass, Doctor Moses Gasela, Rachel Kalidass, Shabeer Khan, Professor Tankiso Moloi, Zakanya Hoosain and the current Deputy Auditor-General Sakani Maluleke. The term of the current AG, Kimi Makwethu, expires at the end of November. The committee’s search for the next Auditor General yielded 71 applications. The experience of those who applied ranged from bus drivers, auditors, cashiers to Ph.D. holders. However, the majority of applicants did have a Bachelor degree in Accounting or Auditing. Most of those who applied were male. More than half of the applicants were between the ages of 31 and 35. Members of the public may comment on the candidates whose CVs will be published on Parliament’s website before the weekend. The committee must report to the National Assembly at the end of this month. Their recommendations, supported by 60% of the House, will be sent to the President, who has the final say on who to appoint. Deputy Chief Whip of the ANC, Doris Dlakude, has called on parliamentary staff to ensure that all background, academic and security verification checks are done thoroughly. “Let’s do our level best as parliament to seek the assistance of state security. The reason I am saying this, the rate of corruption is really, really tearing us apart. We don’t want (to find that) the person we have recommended to the President, that this person has a dark cloud over their head.”
