Former US President Barack Obama has taken the election fight directly to President Donald Trump at the Democratic Convention, accusing his successor of running a White House that resembles a reality show. The 44th and first Black President spoke ahead of the historic nomination of Kamala Harris – who assumed the title of Democratic Vice Presidential nominee on the same night; a first for Black and Asian American women. Below is a report on Harris accepting the vice-presidential nomination:  Obama spoke from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. “I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for President. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care.” “But he never did. For close to four years now, he’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves,” explains Obama. Obama’s wife, Michelle, has told the US this week why they shouldn’t re-elect President Trump. “Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for you,” she said. Trump has hit back, saying he was only elected in 2016 because of “the horror that Obama left Americans.”
