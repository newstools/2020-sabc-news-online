President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa must build a fundamentally different economy post-the COVID-19 pandemic which among other things, substantially improves the material position of women. Ramaphosa was writing in his weekly letter to the nation on Monday, just a day after Women’s Day. He says “ours must be the generation that ends the oppression of women in all its forms”,  adding that we owe it to the brave generation of Women who in 1956 marched against oppression. He has urged commitment from all sectors of society. President Cyril Ramaphosa says while government must provide economic opportunities for women and create an enabling framework, businesses must support women-owned enterprises in the procurement of goods and services, appoint more women to management positions and ensure protection from harassment. He says transport operators, university administrators, school governing bodies, and religious organisations should create conditions for women and girls to travel, study and worship in safety. Men too must reject and speak out against gender-based violence (GBV) even if it is against friends, fathers, or brothers. In the tweet below is the weekly letter from the desk of the President: Let us be the generation that ends the oppression of women in all its forms, in our lifetime. The brave generation of 1956 marched for us all. We owe it to them, to ourselves and to future generations to not betray this noble legacy. https://t.co/03wZLull1a #StaySafe pic.twitter.com/jQt8vTiQZ7 — Cyril Ramaphosa  #StaySafe (@CyrilRamaphosa) August 10, 2020  In the video below, Ramaphosa announces financial boost for businesses owned by women:
