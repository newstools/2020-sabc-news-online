Economic Freedom Fighters Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu says racism against Black people is still perpetuated across the world in different forms. Shivambu opened the debate on Solidarity with the Black Lives Matter Movement during a virtual National Assembly Sitting. The theme of the debate is ” reinforcing the commitment of all South Africans to confront and defeat individual and institutionalised racism in our society and everywhere in the else it exists”.

Racism is the continuous police brutality against Black people in many parts of the world.
