The Eastern Cape Finance Department has commenced investigations relating to COVID-19 related contracts. This follows allegations of maladministration of COVID-19 related funds by public entities in the province. This was prompted by the questionable COVID-19 door-to-door campaign in the OR Tambo District Municipality and the confusion around the procurement of scooters by the Health Department among others. Last month, Premier Oscar Mabuyane wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask for the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to probe these and other allegations. Mabuyane has also asked the office of the Auditor-General to look into every COVID-19 transaction, as to detect traces of corruption. “Although it’s still very early to release information relating to the actual investigation, we want to take our public into confidence that our plan is to start providing preliminary reports on the completed investigation starting by the end of this month. We are also coordinating with law enforcement agencies to avoid duplication. We also want to make a special appeal to the public that if there is any member of the public that has facts around these matters to please not hesitate coming forward,” says Mzukisi Solani, Provincial Finance Department spokesperson. OR Tambo District Municipality faces corruption allegations:  Last month, Presidency Spokesperson Khusela Diko and Gauteng Health MEC, Bandile Masuku, took  leave of absence following an alleged tender corruption. Masuku’s wife, Loyiso, who is an MMC in the City of Johannesburg, also took a leave of absence. It is alleged that MEC Masuku influenced the awarding of a tender to Diko’s husband through a friendship. The SIU is currently investigating the matter. The sons of African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule are also alleged to have received tenders worth R2.7 million in the Free State, where Magashule was once Premier.
