Long queues are expected to form outside liquor outlets in the country on Tuesday morning following the lifting of a ban on the sale of alcohol. On Saturday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the country would move from alert Level 3 to Level 2 of the coronavirus lockdown. The video below, is President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on lockdown Level 2:  Ramaphosa said the ban on the sale of alcohol and cigarettes would be lifted with effect from midnight on Monday. However, the lifting of the ban on the sale of alcohol is with certain conditions. Meanwhile, the Congress of the People (COPE) says the easing of the regulations is a test to all citizens in the fight against the pandemic. Party spokesperson Dennis Bloem says the pandemic is far from over. “It will be against our own safety and health if we think and behave as if the fight against coronavirus is over. The easing of the regulations to Level 2 must be seen as a test to all of us on how disciplined we are.” “This is a crucial and critical time in our fight against the coronavirus. We are calling upon all people not to behave irresponsibly and recklessly. Let us respect the lockdown regulations. It is in our hands to defeat the coronavirus,” explains Bloem. Alcohol sales were prohibited to ease pressure on hospitals and to allow doctors in emergency wards to focus on those infected with the coronavirus than road crashes and other alcohol-related injuries. The Beer Association of South Africa says lifting the ban on alcohol sales will be a lifeline for restaurants and other businesses.
