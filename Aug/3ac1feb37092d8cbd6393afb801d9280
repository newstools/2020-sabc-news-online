Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and her Deputy Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka will be turning their attention to conditions at healthcare facilities in Gauteng this week. In recent weeks, allegations of tender irregularities have surfaced, especially over the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The spokesperson for the Public Protector, Oupa Segalwe, says these allegations prompted its Gauteng office to launch its own investigation. “The idea being to assess if those facilities are coping with the demand for services but also to check the general conditions around those facilities, whether the frontline workers have PPE and so forth.” Segalwe says some facilities were identified as deserving of upgrades. “With a view to increasing the number of beds so that patients are not left in the lurch. So that is the whole idea to help the government to get it right so that everyone is helped and the spread of COVID-19 is curbed.” Corruption allegations Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and Johannesburg MMC of Cooperate Services Loyiso Masuku are on special leave as they face allegations of corruption regarding the procurement of PPEs. The two together with presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko are alleged to have benefitted from a multi-million rand contract which was awarded to a company belonging to Khusela Diko’s husband to supply PPEs in Gauteng. Diko has also been on a leave of absence from her position. In the video below, SABC journalist Samkele Maseko explains allegations against Masuku:
