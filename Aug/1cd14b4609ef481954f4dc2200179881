The slain Wits university Asithandile Zozo from Dutywa, Eastern Cape, has been laid to rest. The 19-year old, known as Kwasa, was stabbed several times by a jealous boyfriend who refused to accept she wants to end the relationship. Zozo was a first year student at Wits University. She was murdered on Monday. The family is demanding justice for Kwasa’s life. They say Gender-Based Violence has robbed them of a peacemaker within their family. Kwasa’s family calls for swift justice:   Relative Dwelisa Zozo says the family feels very aggrieved. “As the family, we feel very aggrieved. It’s very painful for us because this child was very young and we were looking forward to her and her dreams were cut off within just a short space of time and it’s so painful. The knife which was used by the culprit, it appeared on her body.” “We were close. She was my friend. She was my sister. It is overwhelming. It is hard to accept,” says another relative Anelisa Mniki. Family says Kwasa lived in fear of her life:  Tunzi pays tribute to Kwasa Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi has also paid tribute to Kwasa. “Thank you so much in advance to everyone who made the time to come and show support to our beautiful Kwasa, who was very kind-hearted; who was very bright; who was very kind to all of us.” Gender-Based Violence activists say this is enough. “We continue to see spates of shocking deaths by men who say they love them. It shows that our society is deeply troubled, deeply sick. The brutality of it is absolutely sick and we have to address that,” says Dr Lesley Ann-Foster from the Masimanyane Women Support International. The accused in the matter is expected to appear in court next week when he is expected to apply for bail.
