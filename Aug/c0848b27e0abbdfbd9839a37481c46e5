President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to virtually address the 2020 Women’s Day in celebration amid COVID-19 pandemic. This year’s theme is realising women’s rights for an equal future. The day pays tribute to the heroic women who in 1956 marched to the Union Buildings to protest against the draconian pass laws.
