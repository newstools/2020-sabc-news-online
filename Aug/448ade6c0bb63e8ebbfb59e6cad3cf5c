The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) says beneficiaries of the COVID-19 R350 relief grant can now receive their grants at the Post Office or via a bank account of their choice. Spokesperson Sandy Godlwana says this follows challenges that have been reported, including the fact that funds run out at the Post Office. “They can change from receiving their grant at a post office to a bank account of their choice or vice versa. They also have the flexibility to move from one bank to another.” SASSA is opening its systems for approving citizens to update the channel through which payment should be made the development is a response to the challenges some beneficiaries have experienced in trying to access their special relief grant from post offices. The challenge reported included long queues and the fact that funds run out at times.” COVID-19 R350 social relief grant explained:  The relief grant will run until October and there is no cut off date to apply. The special grant was formulated to help those without an income during the COVID-19 pandemic.
