The South African Weather Service has warned South Africans to brace themselves for a cold front which is set to make its landfall on Monday in the Western Cape. Forecasters say the cold front will start moving towards the north-east as of Tuesday and temperatures in the Free State and Gauteng will start dropping. Forecaster Edward Engelbrecht says, “That’s going to result in significant cooling of temperatures, especially over the northeastern parts of the country, where it’s been quite warm over the past few days.” “We can also expect cloudy conditions on Tuesday with a 30% chance of rain over Gauteng as well as parts of Free State. On Wednesday, temperatures will cool down further with Pretoria we’re expecting a maximum of 16 degrees and Johannesburg and Vereeniging 15. From Thursday, the temperatures will improve again into the high teens and that’s gonna stay like that for the rest of the week,” adds Engelbrecht. SA Weather | Monday 17 August 2020 | #SABCWeather
