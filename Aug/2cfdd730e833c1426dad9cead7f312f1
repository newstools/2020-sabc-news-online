The United Nations Chief has urged Zimbabwe’s government to ensure the protection of all fundamental human rights. A Spokesperson indicated that Secretary General Antonio Guterres was following developments in the country with concern. The statement called for the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association to be respected in accordance with Zimbabwe’s human rights obligations. Guterres also called on all political actors and civil society to resolve issues peacefully through inclusive dialogue. The call comes amid public outcry over alleged human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, with ongoing clampdown by security forces. In a bid to stem the negative publicity, Harare is reportedly working on criminalising protests aimed at expressing dissatisfaction at the government. Legislation is being drawn up to make it illegal to campaign against the state. This comes after activists, opposition politicians and even journalists were arrested for participating in an anti-corruption movement last month. The new laws also aim to limit freedom of speech in traditional and social media. Government’s response to the calls for reform, justice and accountability has been criticised internationally but African leaders have remained silent on the matter.
