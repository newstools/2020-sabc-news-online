The family of Collins Khosa, who died after he was allegedly assaulted by members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), is suing the state for R10 million. This follows the Military Ombudsman’s findings that the soldiers acted improperly, irregularly and in contravention of their code of conduct. The Ombud has recommended that the soldiers face appropriate disciplinary action. An earlier report by the SANDF had exonerated the soldiers. Khosa and his brother-in-law were having a drink inside their yard in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, in April when they were accused of violating lockdown regulations. The Khosa family lawyer, Wikus Steyl, says the Ombud’s report will help the family to pursue justice. “The report greatly aids the criminal investigation and the civil claim that the family are proceeding with against the Minister. The civil claim is not for anybody to get rich, it is to support the people that Collins was supporting. Especially the children with schooling, and groceries and basics that will continue, and we will use the Ombud’s report in that civil claim,” says Steyl. On Thursday, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the four suspended SANDF members who were implicated in the murder are facing criminal charges. Mapisa-Nqakula stated that the four soldiers had refused to participate in the Military Ombud’s investigation following legal advice from their lawyers.
