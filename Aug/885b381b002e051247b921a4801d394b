Government has issued a request for proposals to procure 2000 megawatts of emergency power. The move is aimed at relieving a severe energy shortage as embattled Eskom struggles to keep the lights on due to among others its ageing and poorly maintained infrastructure. Last week, Eskom implemented stage 2 load shedding due to unplanned breakdowns. However, on Friday it suspended power outages but warned that the power grid remained vulnerable. In December, government issued a request for information (RFI) to source up to 3000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity.
