Five suspects including three government officials, a former head of the Department of Agriculture in Free State and a retiree from the same department will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. They were arrested by the Hawks on Monday for alleged corruption, fraud and money laundering to the value of R244 million. The arrests are related to the Hawks’ earlier investigations into the Estina dairy project. Two other officials – former Free State Agriculture Chief Financial Officer Sylvia Dlamini and businesswoman Malikomo Mohapi were also arrested by the Hawks in July and are out on R10 000 bail each. Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha says the allegations relate to a company known as Superior Quality which also trades as Rekgonne Community Projects.
