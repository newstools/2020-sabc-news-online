Blom was born in the Eastern Cape in 1904 and came to Cape Town in search of work. Last year, the SABC joined in celebrations for his 115th birthday. At the time, the centenarian said God was the secret to his extraordinary longevity. Spokesperson for the Delft Seniors Forum, Gadija Francis, says he will be dearly missed. “And ever since that time, we focus on Oupa, where we actually give him every year his birthday. And what I can say to Ouma Blom: he had his years. Thursday, I was actually there by Oupa and he was just lying there. Then actually when he hearD my voice he opened the blankets and he just waved for me. But I can see he was actually suffering and he was under pain.” Francis says Blom leaves behind his 85-year-old wife, Jaenette. “What we actually can say to the Blom family, thank God, he’s out of that suffering, he’s out of that pain. He is now in God’s hands. You understand but we sympathise with the whole family but we will still continue to support the family when it comes to the funeral arrangements.  A legend has been called home.
His long journey and work here is done,but Uncle Fredie will never be forgotten.
My heart is breaking for Aunty Blom right now,for his family but especially for her…the love and affection they had for each other was so beautiful to witness  pic.twitter.com/tEa0eKH1if — Earl Hendricks (@EarlCraig06) August 22, 2020
