Deputy President David Mabuza has again asked Parliament to postpone his planned appearance before the National Assembly this coming Thursday to answer oral questions. In a statement, Parliament said Speaker Thandi Modise has received a correspondence from the deputy president requesting another postponement due to ill health. This will be the third time Mabuza will miss his planned appearance before Parliament due to ill health in the recent past. He missed his scheduled appearance before the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces last month citing ill health. His appearance before the National Assembly was subsequently rescheduled for 20 August. Mabuza has however committed to appear before Parliament to answer oral questions once he has fully recovered.
