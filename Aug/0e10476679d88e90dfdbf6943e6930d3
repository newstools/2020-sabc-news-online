Power utility Eskom says stage two loadshedding will continue on Thursday as it’s power generation system is severely constrained. Load-shedding is expected from 9am in the morning until 10pm at night. Eskom spokesperson, Sikonathi Manthshantsha, says they’ve recently restored three generation units and a further two that had tripped. He says that despite this, the system remains under pressure: “Any further deterioration in the generation performance may necessitate the escalation of loadshedding at short notice. The infrastructure is aged, unreliable and volatile and this constrained power system is expected to persist for the rest of the week. We urge the people of South Africa to again help Eskom and reduce electricity usage so we may be able to keep the lights on.” #PowerAlert 1 Eskom to continue implementing Stage 2 loadshedding from 09:00 until 22:00 tomorrow as the
