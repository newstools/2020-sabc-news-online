South Africa’s special envoys to Zimbabwe, Baleka Mbete and Syndey Mufamadi have paid a courtesy visit to President Emmerson Mnangagwa this afternoon. The pair were appointed by President Cyril Rampahosa last week after calls for South Africa to assess recent incidents of alleged human rights violations in Zimbabwe. Last month, security forces cracked down on anti-corruption activists for convening or participating in demonstrations.  At least half a dozen people were arrested for partaking in peaceful protests in their communities.

Zimbabwe government denies that it has violated human rights:  Investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono’s bail appeal dismissed Last week,  Zimbabwe’s High Court dismissed investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono’s appeal for bail. The journalist was arrested last month and charged with inciting public violence. The charges are related to Chin’ono promoting anti-corruption demonstrations that took place on 31 July. The High Court delivered the judgment without any reasons for the decision. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)  labeled the decision a vindictive move by authorities.
