Eastern Cape Prermier, Oscar Mabuyane, says these pods will continue to be used beyond the pandemic. He says this is another great example of the success of the collaborative effort between role players during this pandemic. Mabuyane lamented the fact that these partnerships were not developed and used over the past 25 years to benefit the people of the country. “All of us are to [be] blame for not nurturing such partnerships. The phenominal work we have collectively achieved through partnership during this pandemic should be the first step of forming practical social compacts that benefit society. Not a paper based social compact that are serving the interests of individual stakeholders,” explains Mabuyane.
