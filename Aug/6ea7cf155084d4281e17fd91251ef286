The high court in Ethiopia has ordered the release of Kenyan freelance journalist Collins Juma Osemo, popularly known as Yassin Juma.  Juma is to be released on bail alongside nine other people. He was arrested in July in Addis Ababa after protests erupted following the assassination of a famous Ethiopian musician. Juma was arrested in the house of Jawar Mohammed, a leader of an opposition party, and an open critic of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is also under detention. Yassin Juma appears in court following his arrest in Addis Ababa:  The Kenyan freelance journalist was charged with inciting ethnic violence that led to the death of hundreds of people during the protest that erupted after the murder of a musician from the Oromo ethnic group in Addis Ababa. On 5 August, a court in Addis Ababa ordered for his release, but even after his bail was paid, the police refused to set him and others free. The case was brought before a higher court and the earlier decision has been upheld. Juma insists that he was in Mohammed’s house to seek interviews from Mohammed’s relatives following his arrest. The Kenyan government,  through its embassy in Addis Ababa, has been in touch directly with Juma and says it is closely monitoring the situation.
