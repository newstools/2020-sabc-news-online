The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein is expected to make a ruling in the appeal bid of Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress (ANC) councillor, Andile Lungisa on Monday. Lungisa wants the court to overturn his two-year prison sentence for assault against DA councillor Rayno Kayser. Mcebisi Ngqina reports. In this video below, Eastern Cape PEC plans to replace Andile Lungisa:  Lungisa was convicted of smashing DA councillor Rayno Kayser with a glass jug in the forehead during a brawl in a council meeting in 2016. He was sentenced to an effective two years in prison in 2018 by the Port Elizabeth Magistrateâ€™s Court. But Lungisa believes the sentence handed down by the court was too harsh hence he wants it overturned. This is his second attempt to have the judgement overturned. In 2019 the Grahamstown High Court dismissed his appeal.
