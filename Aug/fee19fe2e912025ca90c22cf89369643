An organisation called Africa 55 States Forum says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the German Ambassador to South Africa should be charged for impropriety. This relates to a R9.5 million donation the German government made to the NPA. The prosecuting body says the money will be used for creating a structure in the office of the National Director of Public Prosecution where the public will be able to lodge complaints about allegations of improper conduct involving NPA staff. However, Africa 55 States president, Dr. Charles Sinkala, says that donation amounts to improper conduct. “There are various charges that can be built up from the case, the investigating officer now has to see the statement which we have written. Receiving money by the National Prosecuting Authority,  I think it is improper whether they have done it before or not. But you know there are procedures, the donation has to go to the Treasury which investigates and checks the intent of the donation and what is meant for.  They have to investigate and find out that if there are no other cases in relation to the donation that might influence their judgment.” EFF condemns the donation Last week, the Economic Freedom Fighters spoke out against the donation. EFF Spokesperson Delisiwe Ngwenya said South African institutions cannot be sustained through loans or contributions from other nations if they are to maintain their integrity and independence. “We have to develop sustainable economic methods and these methods should be derived from internal revenue streams. Then we will be in a position to empower these institutions. We will also be in a position to protect them. We will be protecting them from being beholden by foreign and private interests and agendas.”
