Limpopo’s ANC Treasurer Danny Msiza has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the VBS looting and collapse. The High Court in Pretoria set aside the adverse findings and remarks against Msiza, which are contained in the Reserve Bank’s report, “The Great Bank Heist” on Tuesday. Msiza had been suspected of coercing municipalities to invest public funds meant for service delivery in the defunct VBS mutual bank. The court has found that Advocate Terry Motau’s failure to afford Msiza the right to procedural fairness during investigations is unlawful and unconstitutional. It also violated Msiza’s rights in terms of section 34 of the Constitution. The second respondent, the Reserve Bank, has been ordered to pay the costs of both counsels. The ruling affirms the ANC’s decision to reinstate Msiza into the ANC Provincial Executive Committee in Limpopo. Msiza and the former Vhembe Executive mayor Florence Radzilani, were ordered to step aside by the ANC Integrity Committee following the report in 2018. However, last month – the ANC resolved to reinstate them amid an outcry from various quarters. In the video below, uproar over Msiza and Radzilani’s reinstatement:
