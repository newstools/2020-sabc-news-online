Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has identified two health officials who allegedly enabled the PPE corruption. Premier Makhura was briefing the media in Johannesburg on the province’s latest coronavirus status as part of the Gauteng Coronavirus Command Council. In recent weeks, allegations of corruption over PPE tenders involving Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko emerged. Both Diko and Masuku have have since taken a leave of absence. Meanwhile, Makhura says the province’s daily infections and hospital admission have started to decline. More than 130 000 people have recovered in Gauteng, with just over 2 300 deaths. About 4 400 people are currently hospitalised in public and private facilities in the province. Makhura says there are positive signs in the fight against the virus in the province. “There is a positive story with regard to the recovery rate in Gauteng province, it is back at 70%. There is also a positive story with regard to the number of active cases, they are going down. There was a period in June/July when the number of active cases were back at 65%, now the number of active cases are at 29%,” explains the Premier.

They, however, regret the error of judgment that led to the king’s Royal Bhaca company doing business with the department. The contract has subsequently been cancelled. Masuku has denied involvement in alleged tender irregularities. It has been alleged that the MEC influenced the processes involving the procurement of PPEs. However, Masuku has refuted the allegations as unfounded saying the awarding of contracts within the department rests with the Supply Chain Management in the Finance department.
