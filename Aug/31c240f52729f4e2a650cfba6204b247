A family in Ritchie, in the Northern Cape, has accused the provincial Health Department of misdiagnosing their deceased loved one with COVID-19 and treating their concerns with disdain. This after Chrissie Booysen died a day after being admitted to the state-run Robert Sobukwe hospital in Kimberley. The family says they were first told that the mother had died of heart failure, only to be told two days later, that she had died of COVID-19, a claim they don’t believe. The Booysen family says they’ve had enough of their claims being dismissed by the Northern Cape Department of Health. Family spokesperson, Jan Spandiel says the department has failed to give them answers about what exactly led to the death of their loved one. Spandiel says the family has been living their lives with uncertainty since Booysen’s death. “The doctor said it was her heart. When we got to the hospital, they said that she’s there in the COVID ward. She doesn’t move around. She doesn’t even go to town. She sends her children to town and she doesn’t go anywhere. So for us, it is hard to accept that it was due to COVID-19. We are suspicious and we want answers.” Spandiel insists that if Booysen’s COVID-19 diagnosis was true, the provincial Department of Health has a responsibility to test other family members who lived with her. “If you passed away of COVID-19 and you stayed with your family in the house, that is for sure that your family in the house will also be positive of COVID-19 and we’ve asked that they come and test and no-one has come.” The provincial Health Department did not respond to several requests for comment.
