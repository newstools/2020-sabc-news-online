Gauteng Premier David Makhura says they will publish a list of companies that have been contracted to provide goods and services for COVID-19 in the province. Makhura says they want to be transparent and they will make the list available every month. Health MEC Bandile Masuku has been put on special leave over a controversial 139-million-rand tender involving Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko’s husband, Thandisizwe. Mounting calls for Premier David Makhura to act against Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku:  Masuku has since told Special Investigating Unit investigators that the Dikos worked behind his back. Makhura’s spokesperson Thabo Masebe says:”The Premier David Makhura decided that we should publish the list. As part of our commitment to clean governance, as well as transparency and accountability.” “So, we are publishing a list of companies. The first list will be of companies that have been contracted to provide goods and services since April 2020 mainly for goods and services in relation to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.” Speaking at the weekly Provincial Command Council (PCC) briefing on COVID-19 in Johannesburg last week Thursady, Makhura said action will be taken against implicated officials when he receives the reports from the SIU. “So this is the message I’m sending out today, not just PPE, infrastructure-related procurement; anything we have procured related to COVID-19, which would also include the programme we had around food relief. We do not want a situation where today it’s PPE and tomorrow it’s something else. So, a comprehensive approach to dealing with corruption is to ensure that all procurements done to address COVID-19 related issues must be under full investigation,” said Makhura.
