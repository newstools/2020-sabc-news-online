Former Bosasa employee Bongiwe Dube says she was told about a big order of meat for former Cabinet Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. Dube is one of Bosasa employees testifying at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. Mokonyane was implicated in the testimony of former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer, Angelo Agrizzi, who claimed that Mokonyane received cash bribes among other things to secure lucrative government tenders and to shield the company from criminal prosecution. Dube, whose duties included ordering whatever the kitchen needed – including meat, told the Commission’s chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, how she knew that the order was for Mokonyane. “How I found out about it is the time when I was asking that we are closed and there’s a delivery which is supposed to come here and these people are asking what is it for and what must I do about it and then that’s when I found out it’s for Nomvula Mokonyane.” In the video below is the PART 1 of State Capture:  Birthday party Meanwhile, Victorian Guest House owner, Frederick Hendrik Coetzee has confirmed that he hosted former Minister Mokonyane’s 40th birthday party in 2003 paid for by Bosasa. Also testifying at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry on Tuesday, Coetzee told the Commission that the party had cost about R40 000. “I got a call from Mr Agrizzi himself asking for a quick meeting. He and somebody else from Bosasa which I can’t recall her name came to the guesthouse itself and inquiring to do this function and also informing me who the function would be for. And to answer your questions that Bosasa would pay for the entire event….and who did he say the function was going to be for….it was going to be for Safety and Security Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.”
