President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the nation soon. This while there is growing pressure on his government to open up the economy. On Thursday, the President met with the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) which is the council that brings together government, organised business, organised labour and civil society groups. Cosatu called for the ban on the sale of alcohol to be lifted and has asked for other parts of the economy to be opened to save jobs. Businesses and other groups have made the same call. Nedlac has set up a high-level working team to finalise an urgent economic recovery plan for South Africa after the President presented a Treasury document. Among other things, it has proposed a focus on infrastructure development, reforming SOEs, and increasing the ease of doing business. The economy is expected to contract by 7% this year and the damage could be worse without a credible comeback plan. Previewing President Ramaphosaâ€™s expected to address:
