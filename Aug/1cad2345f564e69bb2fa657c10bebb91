Indians in Tamil Nadu state held special prayers as Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president. There was also hope the US senator, born to an Indian mother and Jamaican father, if elected will address worries over the immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration. Harris made history when US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden picked her as his vice president. She struck a chord in India and Jamaica with her acceptance speech. Indians, who are the largest recipients of H1B work visa the US provides, will have a reason to cheer if Harris elected, said Democrat fund-raiser Sekar Narsimhan. And Neil Makhija, who heads Impact, an Indian American political forum, said there was yet another reason for the Indian community in the US to root for Harris. But the senator’s aunt, Sarala Gopalan, a gynecologist in Tamil Nadu, said she would only pray for Harris to perform well if elected as vice president of the United States. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of eligible voters. More than 11 million of them will be able to vote in November and pundits say Harris was working hard to win their trust. -Reporting by Rana Sen
