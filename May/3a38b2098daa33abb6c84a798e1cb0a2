The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) says the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases is also due to the scaling up of tests being conducted across the country. South Africa currently recorded 7 808 with 153 deaths and 3 153 recoveries. NICD interim Executive Director Professor Lynn Morris says, “There may well be an increase in the number of cases, symptoms will start to show after five days. It’s also related to the number of tests that are being done. The number of tests also continues to increase, so we need to also see it in the context of that.” “There is no doubt that we have had a very aggressive approach to it and it clearly has worked. We can see that, both in the number of cases and deaths. The lockdown has been successful, but I think what we have also seen is the negative effects of the lockdown and the economic impact. We need to get back to normality but hopefully people now have this heightened awareness,” explains Morris. Worst is yet to come Earlier this week, President Cyril Ramaphosa told the nation that the worst is still coming in terms of the high number of COVID-19 infections.
