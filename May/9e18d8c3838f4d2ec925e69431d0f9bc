Two provinces in particular are the major contributors which is the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape.” “This is taking us to 213 positive cases. But key to highlight is that 91 people have recovered. We will continue as a department to ensure that containment measures are in place and prevention remains key in all our action.” Releasing of some prisoners Justice Minister Ronald Lamola has told the country that about 19 000 inmates will be released on parole. President Cyril Ramaphosa has authorised the release of just under 19 000 inmates as part of the COVID-19 parole dispensation. However, only prisoners who have committed petty crimes will be considered for this parole. This provision will exclude prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment or serving terms for serious crimes, including sexual offences, murder, gender-based violence and child abuse.
