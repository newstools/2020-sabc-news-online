The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum says it has recorded more than 200 human rights violations, allegedly committed by uniformed members and state agents, during the ongoing COVID-19 induced national lockdown. The human rights group has raised concerns of escalating gross human right violations, use of brute force, torture, harassment and assault of ordinary citizens by state security agents since March 30, 2020. The watchdog has also called for an urgent and independent investigation into the abduction and subsequent torture of three Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) activists after taking part in a flash demonstration in Harare’s Warren Park high-density suburb. Meanwhile, two freelance journalists Samuel Takawira and Frank Chikowore were arrested by the police on Friday at a local clinic in the capital Harare where they were interviewing the three MDC activists who are recovering at the facility.
