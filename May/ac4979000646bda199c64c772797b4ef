Western Cape strategy Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde, has presented the province’s strategy to a virtual meeting of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Co-ordinating Council. The strategy focuses on areas in each of the City of Cape Town’s eight sub-districts, and in Witzenberg which account for a large proportion of the infections in the Western Cape, which is the highest in the country.  Ministers, premiers of all the nine provinces, as well as representatives of the South African Local Government Association attended the meeting.

Correctional Services appoints health panel The Correctional Services Department says it has appointed a panel of health experts to assist in curbing the spread of the coronavirus in prisons across the country. The department has announced on Sunday that 571 people have now tested positive for the coronavirus at their correctional centres countrywide. 393 of those who have tested positive are inmates while 178 are officials. The Eastern Cape Correctional Centre has the bulk of the positive cases, accounting for 414 confirmed cases. 359 inmates have tested positive in the province while 55 officials have also tested positive.
