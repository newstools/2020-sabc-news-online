An application by the City of Cape Town to stop the Human Rights Commission(HRC) from accessing the Strandfontein site for the homeless will be heard in the High Court on Wednesday. The city set up the shelter when Level 5 lockdown regulations were imposed. The Human Rights Commission says it has a constitutional duty to monitor circumstances inside the shelter.

The city says the homeless will be moved to smaller facilities.
