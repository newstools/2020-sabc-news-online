The Minister of Employment and Labour, Thulas Nxesi, will on Sunday host a media briefing  to update the country on the back-to-work readiness strategy. Nxesi is expected to speak on the businesses legible to return to work as the country has moved from COVID-19 lockdown Level 5 to Level 4. As more businesses and industries will be returning to work, the issue of maintaining social distancing, workers’ health and safety in factories and companies will be one of the focuses by the minister.
