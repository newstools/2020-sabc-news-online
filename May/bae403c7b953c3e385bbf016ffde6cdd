The last “supermoon” of 2020 rose in the night sky on Thursday over a world beginning to re-emerge after weeks of coronavirus-related lockdowns. The supermoon phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 10%of its closest distance to the Earth at the full moon. May’s full moon – at the height of the Northern Hemisphere spring – is also called a “flower moon” – hence Thursday’s “full-flower supermoon.” The year’s two previous supermoons occurred in March and April. Clouds over much of Europe and Asia obscured views of the moon, which appears slightly larger than usual – and the streets remained relatively quiet, with many countries still imposing coronavirus-related restrictions. But from Hong Kong to Jerusalem to Caracas, some locals donned masks and ventured out to take photos of the celestial spectacle.
