The SA Zionist Church Bishop who publicly encouraged congregants to defy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s instruction not to hold public gatherings has paid an admission of guilt fine in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Bishop Bheki Ngcobo acknowledged that he failed to confine to his residence during the nationwide lockdown between 27 March and 30 April. Ngcobo was arrested after a month-long manhunt. Police had been searching for him after he allegedly called on his church members to gather in their numbers for their annual Easter Festival while the country was under lockdown. “The bishop paid an admission of guilt fine of R1500 today in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. This relates to him failing to comply to his residence during the nationwide lockdown. The National Prosecuting Authority welcomes that he has taken responsibility for his actions. He has affirmed to his congregants that the rule of law must always prevail,” says the NPA’s Natasha Ramkisson-Kara. NPA statement below:  Prohibition on public gatherings In March, government issued guidelines prohibiting public gatherings. However, the African Zionist Churches questioned why companies, which employ thousands of people, were still allowed to operate – while a public ban prohibits thousands of the organisation’s members from gathering. Spokesperson for the SA Zionist Churches Bishop Bheki Ngcobo said at the time, “Why are companies still allowed to operate? They were given the precautions and those companies have more than a thousand workers in one building.” “But only the church must not go and worship the Lord. I am not disputing what the President is saying because it is his country, but I do understand that in South Africa God is there. In our congregation, we agreed that we are going to worship the Lord in numbers,” added Ngcobo. In the video below, Bishop Ngcobo insists on congregating for Easter Service:
