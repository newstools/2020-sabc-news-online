The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has commended the SABC for continuing to educate, inform and update the nation during the COVID-19 outbreak. The latest data by the Broadcast Research Council (BRC) on Thursday, revealed that the SABC has taken the lead in the 24-hour news market. CWU says “the increase of its market share, demonstrated the talent and commitment of SABC workers.” It has also applauded the national broadcaster for reaching over 4.5 million viewers. “On free-to-air television news audiences, out of 10 viewed news products nationally; 8 are broadcast on SABC 1 and 2, with IsiZulu and IsiXhosa news bulletins sitting on top with more than 4.5 million viewers and adding some indigenous languages.”  The union has on the other hand condemned “all efforts to discredit the public broadcaster” and attempts to have it reverse the salary increase it has recently given to workers. CWU has reiterated the SABC’s assertion that the hike is part of a wage deal, which was signed two years ago. CWU has called for sound funding models as the SABC remains a vital tool for news and information. “The SABC remains a vital tool for the government, the NGO’s and other important humanitarian work to be done via the public broadcaster, and much of this work does not generate revenue. Therefore, a call for a sound new model of the Public Broadcaster funding remains relevant, with the state playing a critical role. CWU still believes that the OTT’s must pay a broadcasting levy as part of the comprehensive funding model system.”
