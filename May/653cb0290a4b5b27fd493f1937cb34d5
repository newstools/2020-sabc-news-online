The World Health Organisation (WHO) says it has seen the most cases in the last 24 hours globally, since the coronavirus outbreak five months ago. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has referred to more than 100 000 new cases of new coronavirus infection recorded, expressing concern for poor countries even as rich ones emerge from lockdown. “We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference. “We are very concerned about rising cases in low and middle income countries.” “We still have a long way to go in this pandemic. In the last 24 hours, there have been 106 000 cases reported to WHO – the most in a single day since the outbreak began.”  The WHO Head was briefing the media from Geneva, Switzerland:  The World Health Organisation says it is working on a long-term strategy to finance its work following the latest US threat to withdraw funding. US President Donald Trump threatened to permanently cut US funding to the WHO, in a letter shared on Twitter on Monday. Ghebreyesus was responding to repeated media questions about the letter, with stoic acknowledgment of receipt, promising to give clarity soon. When he was pressed further, he revealed that the WHO currently has an annual budget of two-point-three-billion dollars. “And that very small and equivalent to an annual budget of a medium-sized hospital in a developed world we have also developed a strategy to build a foundation who foundation and looking for new sources of funding and also expand our donor base so this had started three years ago” Below is the dashboard tracking global COVID-19 cases, death toll, recoveries and more:
