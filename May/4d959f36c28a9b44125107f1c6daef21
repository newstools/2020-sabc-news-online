The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Northern Cape has criticised the provincial Health Department for allegedly not being forthcoming with information regarding COVID-19 statistics in the province. Northern Cape DA leader, Andrew Louw, says more detailed information about confirmed infections in the province should be made public. Louw says the provincial Health Department has the responsibility to keep Northern Cape residents fully informed to avoid a potential increase in transmission. “People need to get accurate data. They need to know what is the status of every municipality, every town and every ward because at the moment, I find it very distasteful that in this very serious situation that we’re in for the coronavirus, the department is not cooperative as far as that is concerned.” COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases   Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 1910 1308 1078 134 51 41 61 28 21 3 0 0 0 UNALLOCATED 0 DEATHS CONFIRMED CASES |9 420 DEATHS | 186 TESTS CONDUCTED | 324 079 6 RECOVERIES | 3 153 CLOSED CASES | 3 339 95 18 43 4809 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); The provincial Health Department has refuted allegations that it is concealing information. “I just want to make an appeal again to the DA not to play to the gallery.

We are giving updates on a regular basis. but it’s fine, I’m going to give them the information in that has been in the media the information in that has been in the media,” says Health MEC, Mase Manopole.
