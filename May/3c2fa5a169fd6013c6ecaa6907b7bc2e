United States (US) President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was working on a strong response to China’s planned national security legislation for Hong Kong and it would be announced before the end of the week. China’s parliament is expected to approve a proposed security law that would reduce Hong Kong’s separate legal status on Thursday, calling into question the special economic status the territory currently enjoys under US law. At a White House news briefing, Trump was asked if he planned sanctions against China over Hong Kong and if he intended to put restrictions on visas for students and researchers from China. “We’re doing something now. I think you’ll find it very interesting … I’ll be talking about it over the next couple of days,” he replied. Pressed if this would include sanctions, he said: “No it’s something you’re going to be hearing about … before the end of the week, very powerfully I think.” Trump did not elaborate.
