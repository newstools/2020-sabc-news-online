Two police sergeants of the Western Cape Anti-Corruption unit have been arrested for alleged corruption in Manenberg. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana says this follows a complaint from an Athlone resident. He alleged that the two policemen visited him in June 2019 and accused him of printing and selling passports. They seized his laptop and cellular telephones and took him to the Manenberg police station, where they allegedly demanded money to secure his release. Rwexana says the complainant alleges that he paid the two policemen R5 000 in cash for his release and the return of his laptop and cell phones. The Anti-Corruption Unit investigated the complaint. The pair’s arrest follows a warrant from the Athlone Magistrate’s Court.
