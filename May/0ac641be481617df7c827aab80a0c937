The impact of COVID-19 has left many Grade-12 learners feeling stressed and anxious. Most of them are now relying on online learning as they try to cover up for lost time and get through the final year of high school. However, without the face to face interaction and support from teachers, studying is proving to be a daunting task that requires serious discipline and commitment. Cassey Chambers from the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) says it’s been an emotional time for matric learners and therefore parents need to pay special attention to them during these trying time. “Some of the signs and symptoms you can look for in your matric student that perhaps they are feeling more anxious and overwhelmed than usual, is a drastic change in eating and sleeping habits. Wanting to be more alone and isolated. Even feeling agitated, quick to anger, grumpy all the time. I know that a lot of these symptoms sound like normal teenage behavior, but remember they are also dealing with COVID- 19 and they might not know how to express themselves. As parents it’s really important that you connect with your teenager during this time, having a meaningful conversation to really understand what is causing the anxiety and stress, just a daily check in.” Department of Education not ready for reopening of schools: SADTU The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) says the Department of Basic Education is not ready to reopen schools.
