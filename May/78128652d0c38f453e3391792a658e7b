Among those who died are a two-day-old baby and a healthcare worker. “Sadly, we have recorded the first neonatal mortality related to COVID-19. This was a 2-day-old baby that was born prematurely and therefore, had lung difficulties which required ventilation support immediately after birth. “The mother had tested positive for COVID-19 and the child subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 as well. It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying condition of prematurity,” the statement explained.  The department has sent its condolences to the mother and those that cared for the baby. 506 861  18 003  8 ﻿950  8 714  339  9 ﻿289 18 252  (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Coronavirus in the Western Cape The ministry has expressed devastation over losing the healthcare worker in the Western Cape. “When COVID-19 claims the lives of the very people who are the bedrock of the national response, we feel the loss in so many ways.
