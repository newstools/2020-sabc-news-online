The United Nations (UN) in Southern Africa has expressed satisfaction with the manner in which the South African government is handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This emerged during a support partnership dialogue that Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane organised in Pretoria. The partnership is aimed at ensuring that disadvantaged young girls and women are supplied with sanitary towels and shelter during the lockdown period. The UN envoy to South Africa, Nardos Bekele-Thomas says the world body is pleased with South Africa’s response programmes to the outbreak. “As the UN, we are pleased with the level of government leadership in robust and comprehensive health and socio-economic programs undertaken. What is happening today is a continuation of our commitment in solidarity with the South African government and partners to ensure that gains made towards the achievement of sustainable development goals are not reversed,” explains Bekele-Thomas.

She says this will contribute immensely towards reviving the economy post the lockdown. “Because the economy has been drastically affected by the COVID-19. As we rise out of that women must not go and still be struggling the same old way for them to be part and parcel of the ownership of the means of production in this country. So I would like to say this partnership is going to be a long one even when we are gone because it an institutional one and not based on us,” explains minister Zulu.
