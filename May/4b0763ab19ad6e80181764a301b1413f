President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also the President of the African National Congress (ANC), has called on the party to follow in the footsteps of struggle stalwart, Denis Goldberg and lead with integrity, especially during this difficult time. Ramaphosa was speaking during a virtual memorial service for Goldberg, as the country battles the coronavirus. The ceremony was carried live on SABC TV and the public broadcaster’s online service. Goldberg died of cancer at the age of 87 in Cape Town last week. Ramaphosa says Goldberg displayed great integrity in his fight against the apartheid regime. “He was a man and a leader of unquestionable integrity reminding us that leadership is a weighty responsibility at a time when our people, the entire African continent, and indeed the world look to its leaders for reassurance. We must indeed do what has to be done with the utmost integrity and moral conscience. I salute this great South African and I thank him for the extraordinary service to his people and to the country.” Former Rivonia trialist, Andrew Mlangeni, says it’s a pity that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown regulations overshadow a proper send-off for Goldberg. “He made a great contribution. The freedom that we are today enjoying is as a result of the contribution that comrade Goldberg has made together with many other comrades who have passed away. So, we have lost a great man a great leader and I don’t know if we will be able to replace him.” The video below captures the life and times of Denis Goldberg:
