Members of Parliament have applauded the SABC for its role in the coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic and for turning the company around. Members of the Communications Committee say the SABC has led the way in keeping the public informed about the virus. This after the public broadcaster informed Parliament that it expects to pay a heavy price for these broadcasts, which are largely unfunded. The corporation says it expects a revenue shortfall of more than R1.5 billion, mostly because of the displacement of programmes to make way for COVID-19 coverage. MPs were, however, very complimentary about the work the organisation has done. DA MP, Phumzile van Damme says, “You have an important role to play in getting the message across to the people of SA about this virus. In particular, to those who don’t have access to DSTV and from what I’ve seen, you are doing a great job at that as well … these regular public service announcements on radio and on TV. Thank you for that good work.” Confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa On Tuesday night, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize announced that the country has now 17 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 7 960 recoveries and 312 deaths Minister Mkhize says there are 767 new infections.
