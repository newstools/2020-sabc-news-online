The legal battle for the political control of the Tshwane Metro is set to continue, as the Democratic Alliance (DA) intends to approach the Pretoria High Court this week. The DA will file an application to enforce a High Court judgment which nullified the dissolution of the city council. The party will also oppose an appeal application filed by Gauteng Cogta MEC, Lebogang Maile and the EFF. Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Maile dissolved the Tshwane council in March. But, that decision was declared unlawful by the court after the DA had challenged it. Refusing to back down, MEC Maile and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) launched an application to appeal the judgment, last Friday. That was the day before the judgment was supposed to be effective. Maile also indicated that he intends heading to the Constitutional Court with the matter. Now, the DA has announced that it intends to apply to the Pretoria High Court for the enforcement of the judgment. Their two-pronged application is expected to be filed this week. They are also opposing Gauteng provincial government and EFF’s application for leave to appeal. Pending the outcome of the looming court battles, Tshwane remains under administration. The City has been unstable for several months with political parties fighting for the capital’s control. The DA says it will most probably file its application on Wednesday.
