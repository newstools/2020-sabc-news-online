The British American Tobacco South Africa (BATSA) says it has taken a decision not to pursue any legal action against the government over the ban on the sale of cigarettes. The decision comes after BATSA received a letter from ministers in the National Command Council. “We are convinced that by working together (with government) we can find a better solution that works for all South Africans and removes the threat of criminal sanction from 11 million tobacco consumers in the country,” says BATSA in a statement.
