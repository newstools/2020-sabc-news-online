As administrative staff at schools across the country are expected to return to work on Monday, Equal Education has expressed concern over government’s lack of clarity on how learners and educators will be protected in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga earlier said the school calendar has been adjusted to save the academic year. In the video below, Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga and Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation, Dr. Blade Nzimande provide updates on work done to prepare for the reopening of schools:  Teachers will be expected to be back at work on May 18 to prepare for Grade 7 and 12 pupils, who could go back to school on June 1.  Motshekga says schools need at least a month to prepare for the return of pupils.   General Secretary at Equal Education, Noncedo Madubedube, says although Motshekga outlined a framework of dates and possible risk interventions, her department failed to provide exact details on a number of issues.
