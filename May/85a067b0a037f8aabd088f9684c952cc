The Nelson Mandela Foundation, Imbumba Foundation and the Kolisi Foundation have partnered in an initiative to help with food security during the coronavirus lockdown. It’s called #Each1Feed1.  The name of the initiative is inspired by the old Congress of South African Students mantra “Each one, teach one” and is adopted in honour of struggle stalwart Oliver Reginald Tambo, affectionately known as OR Tambo. The partnership has distributed food in Mvezo, Nelson Mandela’s birthplace as well as the global icon’s hometown of Qunu.  Springbok rugby captain Siya Kolisi and Mandela’s grandson, Mandla Mandela, roped in local chiefs to better distribute the food to the needy. “We have been able to bring together 500 food parcels for 500 beneficiaries. As Madiba’s community when we received the news of this gesture, we immediately contacted the immediate surrounding chiefs of this area,” explains the Mvezo chief.
