Acting Gauteng Social Development MEC Panyaza Lesufi has visited the Walter Sisulu Primary School in Olivenhoutbosch, Centurion, after reports of one person being injured in an apparent stampede as the crowd attempted to get food parcels. Residents of the various wards had received text messages that the parcels would be distributed on Saturday.

There is also concerns over the maintenance of social distancing measures with the amount of crowds at the distribution area. Lesufi has held discussions with community leaders and the Mahlasedi Foundation, which sponsored the food parcels in partnership with the Department of Social Development. “There are proposals that are on the table and because we know who has registered, it will be better to then go and deliver this food door-to-door house-to-house. Secondly, that we are going to open all our schools now so that people get inside and there’s social distancing while we are still working on other alternatives. They’ve got the stock to feed everyone literally everyone around this area. So, we just need to manage the social distancing. We need to manage the queues. We also need to manage that the right people get the food that they need here,” says Lesufi. In the video below, families in Limpopo are provided with food parcels:
