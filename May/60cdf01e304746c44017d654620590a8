Parents in KwaZulu-Natal have expressed mixed reactions to Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga’s announcement that schools will re-open on June 1 for Grades 7 and 12. Some say the department must be given a chance to proceed with the academic year. Others say they do not believe everyone can be home schooled and that it is too soon for schools to re-open as the number of coronavirus infections are still rising. In the audio below, parents express their views: More questions than answers The Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools (FEDSAS) says it has been left with more questions than answers after Motshekga’s announcement. FEDSAS CEO Paul Colditz says they have been flooded with questions from schools, as well as concerned parents seeking clarity on whether all the necessary requirements have been met for a safe return to school. Colditz says, “I’m afraid the announcement left us with more questions than answers. That’s quite apparent from all the questions we’ve been getting from schools all over the country. The fact is that the grassroots level, we know and have experienced it that the majority of provinces are not ready to open on the 1st, or to receive learners and teachers in an environment which is as far as humanly possible able to guarantee their safety, well-being and health.” In the video below, a concerned mother and her Grade 12 son react to the re-opening of schools:  INFOGRAPHIC: Back to School plan: Department of Basic Education’s proposed plans for learner safety amid COVID - 19 COVID-19 | SA's BACK TO SCHOOL PLAN Social Distancing No hugging No handshaking Direct contact must be avoided Only two learners per desk Cloth masks to be worn by learners and teachers at all times Extra classes should be arranged in small groups that maintain social distancing.
