After shutting down a COVID-19 relief kitchen in Harare for several days – the Zimbabwean government has had a change of heart. Samantha Murozoki can once again open up her home and her heart to her community. Before being shut down – the immigration lawyer turned businesswoman was feeding more than 1 400 people twice a day from her kitchen. Authorities told her she cannot operate as she wasn’t registered with the local municipality and didn’t meet the health and safety requirements.
