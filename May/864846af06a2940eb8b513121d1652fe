The Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital at Phoenix north of Durban is being decontaminated after six nurses and four patients tested positive for COVID-19. Hospital Board member Sham Maharaj says the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department will monitor the facility to ensure adherence to measures to contain the spread. He says strict protocols will be implemented when admitting new patients. Maharaj says, “Well number one, everybody is being quarantined and number two, decontamination is happening through-out the hospital. We can’t put people at risk. The issue is that the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department is being called in to make sure we do a follow up so that we don’t have any drama, because right now, if we don’t do that, contamination is going to happen in a big way, so we are taking precautions, but we can’t prevent this kind of thing. Worldwide there is a problem here.” INFOGRAPHIC: COVID-19 cases in South Africa:  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 2521 1735 2459 185 120 80 98 39 UNALLOCATED 0 12888 AS AT 22 May 2020 53 3 0 1 DEATHS 6 257 29 47 1 CONFIRMED CASES | 20 125 DEATHS | 397 TESTS CONDUCTED |  543 032 RECOVERIES | 10 104 CLOSED CASES | 10 501 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
