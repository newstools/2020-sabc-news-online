The first heavy cold front of winter made landfall in the Cape Peninsula this week, bringing with it concerns over cold-related viruses. Ramlachan says there are various viral infections that develop during cold weather. “The important facet of good health in any outbreak or virus is important for patients. And the reason for that is that if you are healthy,  you are able to mount a good response to any virus that affects you, whether it’s coronavirus, whether it’s the flu virus. Whether it’s the cold or any of those, at least you know your body will be good and healthy to mount a response against it.”
