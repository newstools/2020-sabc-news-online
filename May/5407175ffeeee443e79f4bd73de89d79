The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday reported 1 219 066 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 25 253 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 2 495 to 73 297. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus, as of 4 p.m. ET on May 6, compared with its count a day earlier. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said his administration was considering further economic measures, possibly via executive orders, to provide help against the economic fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic. In remarks to reporters at the White House, Trump appeared to confirm the possibility of further postponement of the deadline for filing 2019 federal income tax returns, already extended by three months to July 15. “Things could happen like that. We have to help people,” Trump said in response to a question about the tax deadline and economic measures that would not require congressional action. “We can do things … through executive order or otherwise that can help a lot of people … like delays. We can do delays of various files. … I can see that happening,” he said. Congress has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $3 trillion, including payments of $1,200 to many individuals and more than $650 billion in loans to small businesses. Asked whether there would be more direct payments to individuals, Trump said: “Well, something could happen. There’s talk about something happening. We’ll see what’s going on.”
