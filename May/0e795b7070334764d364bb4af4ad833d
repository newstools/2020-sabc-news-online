The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday reported 1 248 040 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 28 974 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 2 180 to 75 477. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus, as of 4 p.m. ET on May 7, compared with its count a day earlier. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic triggered the steepest monthly loss of US jobs since the Great Depression, data showed on Friday, as a second White House aide was diagnosed with the respiratory infection, raising doubt that the highest levels of government are well protected. A day after the White House confirmed that the personal valet of President Donald Trump had tested positive, Trump told reporters the virus had also infected Katie Miller, press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. She is married to senior Trump aide and immigration policy hard-liner Stephen Miller and travels frequently with Pence. “We’ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,” White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany told reporters. Concern over infection control in the White House heightened as the Labor Department reported US unemployment rose 14.7% last month, up from 3.5% in February and demonstrating the speed with which the economy collapsed after stay-at-home orders meant to curb the outbreak were imposed across most of the country. Even worse economic news may be yet to come. The economic devastation has heightened the urgency behind efforts by governors to get their states’ economies moving again, even though infection rates and deaths are still rising in some parts of the country.
