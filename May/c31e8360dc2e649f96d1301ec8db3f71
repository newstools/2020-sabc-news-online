The province has screened over 700 000 people with about 2000 people tested. Saul dismissed claims that the province is not doing enough testing The premier says the specialist Cuban doctors deployed to the province will strengthen the province’s ability to deal with any surge in COVID- 19 infections. “Over the years our health care, particularly, Public Healthcare in the province has been driven on the backbone of Cuban doctors. It’s not our first experience having them here and they have done excellent work over the past few years. So the highly specialised team will be expected to stay here in Kimberley to strengthen the capacity of our tertiary hospital and others will be deployed to the different districts.” The cohort of Cuban doctors which includes family physicians, epidemiologists, and biologists are expected to be taken through a week-long orientation before they are deployed throughout the Northern Cape.
