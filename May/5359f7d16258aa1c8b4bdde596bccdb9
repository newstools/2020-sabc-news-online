Lesotho lawmakers and South African mediators said on Saturday that legislation awaiting assent from the king will see Prime Minister Tom Thabane leave office soon, ending a crisis that has engulfed the mountain kingdom for months. The 80-year-old Thabane has been under pressure to resign over his first wife’s murder case, in which he and his current wife are suspected of involvement. They both deny the charges. The case has divided Thabane’s All Basotho Convention (ABC) party and triggered sporadic unrest. “We are satisfied that when the king has assented to this bill. It will pave the way for the prime minister to indicate his intention to vacate the office,” South African envoy Jeff Radebe told journalists. “As soon as His Majesty has assented to this bill, the prime minister will indicate his intention to leave the office,” he added, without saying whether or not Thabane had agreed to do so. Thabane’s previous wife, 58-year-old Lipolelo was gunned down on 14 June 2017. They were going through divorce proceedings at the time. In 2020, police charged Thabane’s current wife, Maesaiah, with the murder and also named the Prime Minister as a suspect. Thabane has not been charged in court and a decision on whether the Prime Minister can be tried while in office is yet to be made by Lesotho’s Constitutional Court.

Thabane was quoted in media last week as saying he will not be hurried out of office, despite pressure from within his own All Besotho Convention Party, its coalition partners, opposition and regionally powerful neighbour, South Africa. Political instability Thabane has previously said he will leave at the end of July, but his opponents say that is not soon enough. On Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that prevents Thabane from dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in the event of a vote of no confidence against him, meaning that should such a vote pass he has no choice but to leave. “Now that the amendment has been passed, we are just waiting for it to be passed onto His Majesty for assent … and there will be preparations for the PM to leave, in a decent, dignified manner,” ABC Secretary Lebohang Hlaele told Reuters. Deputy leader of the opposition party, Democratic Congress, Motlalentoa Letsosa said he was preparing a vote of no confidence that could go to parliament as early as next week if the king signs off on the amendment. Independent political analyst Lefu Thaela said Thabane would most likely lose the vote, and would have a choice between stepping down and “going the dictatorship route” of digging in and hoping the military supports him. Political instability frequently boils over in Lesotho, which has experienced several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966. Its conflicts often draw in South Africa, whose central mountains encircle it. Perched at high altitude, Lesotho supplies vital drinking water to its drier neighbour.
