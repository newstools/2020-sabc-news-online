Parliament says it wants former Khoisan soldiers to first explain why they should be integrated into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), before making any recommendations on the matter. In 2012, the Khoisan Self Defence Unit applied to court for its former soldiers to join SANDF after the duration of the intake has expired. That court application was dismissed. The Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans has discussed a report of Parliament’s legal research unit on the legitimacy of the Khoisan Self Defence Unit. The committee has resolved to call the Unit’s former soldiers to make a presentation to the committee on the matter after the lifting of national lockdown regulations. “We need to arrange perhaps when the lockdown is relaxed that we invite the gentlemen and ladies to come and make a full presentation to the portfolio committee. Maybe also possibly invite the SACC leadership whom we know many of them were part of the SANDF and start asking them why they were not integrated. And by the time we finalised the whole review, we will be in a better position to recommend to the speaker,” says committee member Bantu Holomisa.
