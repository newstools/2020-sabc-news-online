The World Health Assembly has adopted a resolution that would initiate a process of an impartial, independent evaluation of the World Health Organisation’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The vote, by consensus among the 194 member states, determines that such an investigation would happen at an appropriate time. The Assembly’s decision comes a day after United States President Donald Trump publicly released a letter he’d sent to Director-General Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus threatening to make a temporary funding freeze permanent if the organisation didn’t commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days. The resolution determines a stepwise process of an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation to review the experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the text urges measures on global coordination, implementation of national action plans, including a whole of government and society approach to the virus while calling on international stakeholders to work collaboratively to facilitate equitable and affordable access to vaccines and therapeutics.
