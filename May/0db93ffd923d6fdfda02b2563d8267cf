WHO’s Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus gives an update on COVID-19. More than 4.15 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 282 380 have died, according to a Reuters tally, as of 1625 GMT on Monday. The head of the World Health Organisation Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the “slow, steady lifting of lockdowns” was key, as a jump in the coronavirus cases in South Korea and Germany raised global concerns about a second wave of infections.  WHO principal legal officer Steven Solomon told and online news briefing that only member states could decide who attends the World Health Assembly (WHA). Taiwan, with the strong support of the United States, has stepped up its lobbying to be allowed to take part as an observer at next week’s meeting of the WHO‘s decision-making body, to China’s anger. China berated New Zealand on Monday for its support for Taiwan’s participation at the WHO, saying the country should “stop making wrong statements” on the issue to avoid damaging bilateral ties. -Additional reporting by Reuters
