Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says he is not happy about the lack of social distancing measures at Rea Vaya bus stations in Soweto.   The minister accompanied by Gauteng Transport MEC, Jacob Mamabolo and Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo, visited a few Rea Vaya bus stations in the township on Tuesday morning to assess whether lockdown regulations are being implemented.   They also took a bus ride with commuters from Thokoza Park to Orlando. Mbalula says he will be meeting with the management of Rea Vaya to find ways of enforcing social distancing regulations. “I am not happy with the execution which is why after this meeting, we will meet with people who are running these buses so that we will ensure that there are marshals inside the buses and in the stations so that people are able to keep the social distance.” “But over and above that inside the bus people are sitting too close to each other. If what I saw and this is what happens on a daily basis, you can forget [about lessening infections inside these buses]. Rea vaya is going to be a transporter and a spreader of coronavirus,” adds the minister.
