President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Sunday afternoon convene a virtual engagement with members of the South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF). In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic President Ramaphosa has commended the media for keeping the nation informed. The President has held a series of meetings and consultations with various sectors of society since the beginning of the pandemic to ensure that the national effort to combat the crisis is inclusive. The virtual meeting with SANEF will afford the President an opportunity to engage editors on the country’s ongoing measures to manage the spread of COVID-19 through the risk-adjusted strategy.   The country will on Monday begin alert Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown, which will see more industries reopen along with places of worship. Grade 7 and Grade 12 learners are also expected to resume schooling.
