Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffrey says various courts in the Western Cape from Parow to Paarl, have been affected by COVID-19 after some of the staff tested positive. Responding to questions from members of Parliament (MPs) in a virtual briefing to the Justice and Correctional Services Committee, Jeffrey says a court was also affected after an inmate tested positive in Paarl. Jeffrey says, “A court orderly tested positive in Parow in a municipal court, that’s apparently separate from the main court. However, Western Cape is the epicenter, there are a number of cases. It could be orderlies who are actually South African Police Services members which occurred in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court. I know that the Paarl, I think it’s a staff member. Stellenbosch I think it was an awaiting trial inmate.” In the video below, the Judiciary briefs the media on measures to be adopted by courts amid COVID-19: Strict regulations for courts In April, Justice and Correctional Services minister, Ronald Lamola announced strict regulations to govern how courts will operate during the nationwide lockdown. The regulations were published in the government gazette as part of broader efforts aimed at combating the spread of COVID-19. The regulations include restricting access to courts. Only persons with a material interest in the case such as a litigant, accused, witness, or persons who are providing support to children or persons with disabilities will be allowed into the courtroom.
