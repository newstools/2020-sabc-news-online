The number of people who’ve died from coronavirus related complications has increased by 8, bringing the total to 161 in South Africa. 424 more people have been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 in the last 24-hours. The total number of cases in the country now stands at 8 232.  The Western Cape still has the highest numbers with six short of 4-thousand cases. Gauteng follows with 1 804. Over 292 000 tests have been conducted. A third of them have been done in Gauteng. This dispelling the notion that the Western has high numbers because of increased testing than other provinces. Only 20% of all tests account for the Western Cape. Meanwhile, provinces like the North West and the Northern Cape each only accounted for 1% of all tests conducted. The Western Cape also has the highest ratio of deaths with nearly half of the country’s total.
