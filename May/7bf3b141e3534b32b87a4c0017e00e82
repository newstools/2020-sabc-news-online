Western Cape Health MEC, Nomafrench Mbombo, says the law enforcement and South African National Defence Force contingents deployed across the country are focussing on the wrong aspects of the national lockdown, when it comes to adherence to the regulations. The country is on Level-4 of the lockdown at the moment which will see some industries open in order to stimulate some economic activity. However, the main regulations of social distancing and staying at home, if you are not an essential worker, still remain in place. It is now also mandatory to wear a mask when in public. The Western Cape is currently the epicentre of the virus with 2 700 infections and 56 deaths. Thus far 30% of all testing countrywide were conducted in the Western Cape. Mbombo says South Africans have to be policed as they are not adhering to social distancing regulations on their own. “There is no social distancing be it in the township, be it in the Cape Flats in the Western Cape. Same applies across what I’ve seen in other provinces. And yet remember the social distancing in terms of who has to control and manage it, it is the law enforcement officers – the SAPS,  the military that are supposed enforcing it but you don’t see any of that.” Western Cape also has the highest COVID-19 related deaths with 56 deaths recorded. Gauteng province has the highest recorded recoveries with 948.  Government has expressed relief over the increase in the number of recovered COVID-19 patients, which now stands at 2 549.
