A 38-year-old man is expected to appear at the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon, on charges of possession of drugs. The man was arrested with an estimated street value of drugs worth well over a million rand. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says police received a tip-off on drug activities in Wakesleigh Road in Bellair, Durban. “The police officers from the provincial drug and firearm unit and provincial organised crime units continued with their mandate to root out the drug trade in the province, which led to the arrest of a 30-year-old suspect and the recovery of heroin. The police proceeded to Wakesleigh Road in Bellair after complaints of drug-related activities in the area were reported and 1 kilogram of pure heroin and 35 000 capsules of heroin were recovered from the suspects and the recovered drugs have an estimated value of R1 450 000,” says Gwala.
