China reported two new coronavirus cases for May 6, unchanged from the same number of increases the day before, data from the national health authority showed on Thursday. Both were so-called imported cases involving travellers from overseas, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The two cases from the day before were also imported. The commission also reported 6 new asymptomatic cases for May 6, versus 20 from the previous day. China’s total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 82 885, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4 633, the national health authority said. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday renewed his aggressive criticism of China, blaming it for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from the coronavirus and demanding again that it share information about the outbreak. “They knew. China could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. China could have spared the world descent into global economic malaise,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference. “China is still refusing to share the information we need to keep people safe.” COVID-19 has killed more than 255 000 people worldwide, including more than 70 000 in the United States, making it the worst-affected country according to official statistics. The virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. Most experts believe it originated in a market there selling wildlife and jumped from animals to people, although Pompeo has said there is significant evidence it came from a laboratory.
