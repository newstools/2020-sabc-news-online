Public Service and Administration Minister Senzo Mchunu has urged various heads of government departments to ensure that necessary hygienic precautions are put in place as most public servants are preparing to return to work post lockdown. He says public servants should be capacitated through a plethora of guidelines and skills relating to COVID-19. According to the Minister, employees who will be required to work from home will be equipped with the necessary tools such as laptops to execute their duties smoothly – while individuals with underlying health conditions will be required to produce doctor’s proof to be granted permission to operate from home.
