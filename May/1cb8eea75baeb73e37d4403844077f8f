More than 20 laptops have been stolen from a school outside Louis Trichardt in Limpopo. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says that unknown thieves broke into a store room of the secondary school at Madombidzha village and stole 24 laptops, valued at more than R120 000. More than 400 schools have been burgled and vandalised in different parts of the country since the national lockdown was effected in March. Mojapelo says they’ve launched a manhunt for the suspects. “The police in Tshilwavhusiku outside Louis Trichardt have launched a manhunt for unknown number of suspects who allegedly broke into the store room of a local secondary school and stole 24 laptops. The principal of the school alerted the police. On arrival it was found that the suspects burgled into the store room where the laptops were stored.

SADTU concerned about school vandalism Last week, South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) in North West condemned the vandalism of schools in different parts of the province during the lockdown. 60 schools in the province have been vandalised. The union’s provincial secretary Els Themba said the department needs to take appropriate measures before the re-opening of schools. “We believe that the department should be able to make sure that they are able to put measures in place to make sure that those particular schools prior to the reopening, necessary arrangements are made so that proper schooling can resume on time when there is a directive when the schools should resume.” Edit
