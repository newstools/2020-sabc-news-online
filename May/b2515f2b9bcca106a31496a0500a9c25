The opening of some sectors this week has fuelled fears of a sharp rise in coronavirus infections. However, the Chair of the COVID-19 Ministerial Advisory Committee Professor Salim Abdool-Karim, says there is no need to panic.
He says an increasing number of cases is inevitable. “There is no natural immunity to this virus, there is no vaccine.  We are going to carry the risk.” There is concern about increased economic activity and movement of people on Level-4 lockdown. “As the number of existing cases is high you would expect a larger number of new cases so that is expected….there is nothing to be concerned about.” Abdool-Karim has called for people to put prescribed precautions ahead of everything. “There was no reason for us not to switch from Level-5 to Level-4 , in fact in other parts of the country they would need to go to a lower level sooner than later but it must be assessed carefully and monitored before those decisions are made.” In the video below, Professor Salim Abdool-Karim discusses the COVID-19 statistics in SA:  Professor Salim Abdool-Karim has poured cold water on Madagascar’s purported herbal cure. “ I would be very hesitant to encourage anyone to take anything without proof, we have already seen how chloroquine was promoted very early in this pandemic and it turned out it had severe side effects of very little benefit.” On the use of tobacco products, he said;  “Our advice has been largely on what would help our country move forward in terms of being better prepared for the epidemic and what to do to minimize the impact.” The global number of COVID 19 cases stands at 3 663 222, with recoveries at 1 205 653.
