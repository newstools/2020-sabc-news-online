Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs says a delegation of the committee will visit the Lindela Repatriation Centre near Krugersdorp on Gauteng’s West Rand on Monday morning. The committee says their visit follows last week’s escape of 37 people from the centre – in what is suspected to be an inside job. The video below is reporting that 37 people escaped from Lindela Repatriation Centre:  Leading the delegation to Lindela will be Committee Chairperson Bongani Bongo. He says the delegation will get a report on what transpired before the escape incident. Bongo says they will also assess whether the centre is adhering to the health protocols against COVID-19. When Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi appeared before the Committee during a virtual briefing on Thursday last week, concerns were raised about the suitability of Lindela for human beings. But the Minister said if Lindela was not fit for human habitation this would have been picked up by human rights bodies like the SAHRC which is stationed permanently at the centre.
