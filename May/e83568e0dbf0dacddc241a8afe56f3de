South Africans have opened their hearts and purses to help a struggling home for abused and abandoned babies in Somerset West near Cape Town. It is a place of safety for babies and children up to the age of six years. When the SABC visited the Heartlands Baby Sanctuary shortly after lockdown started, its financial situation was dire. The facility relies on various projects, including a coffee shop and bookshop for an income that had to close during lockdown. Due to the easing of regulations including fundraising, they can now reopen. CEO Monica Buitendag says the support has been overwhelming. “A family ran around the house for 24-hours raising funds, people were shaving off their hair to raise funds and one of our international volunteers in Switzerland raised funds by creating a circle of candles. She lit a candle in her church for every kilometre we ran. It has been a very humbling experience being supported by the community.” In the video below, New Hope for Heartlands Baby Sanctuary:  South Africans have opened their hearts and purses to help a struggling home for abused and abandoned babies in Somerset.
