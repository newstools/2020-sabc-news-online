An Eastern Cape family is expected to meet government officials on Monday to discuss the repatriation of the remains of their son from Cuba. 30-year-old Sibusiso Qongqo died in Havana on Wednesday last week after a short illness. He was a fifth-year medical student. Qongqo was admitted to the hospital after being diagnosed with acute pancreatitis which causes the pancreas to become inflamed. Due to the global coronavirus pandemic and the grounding of airlines, it’s not clear when his remains will be repatriated to South Africa. South Africa’s ambassador to Cuba Thaninga Shope-Linney says, “Our hearts go out to his family, particularly because at this very, very difficult time, his parents cannot come to take his body home. He either has to be buried here or cremated but once the airlines start building again, the remains of the body can be taken back to South Africa. So, we are waiting for his parents to guide us on what will need to be done.” The family is expected to release a statement after the meeting.
