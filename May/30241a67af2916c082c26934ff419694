The South African Airways (SAA) Business Rescue Practitioners (BRPs) say the statement released by the airline that it would be resuming domestic flights in the middle of June, is in violation of the BRPs communications protocol put in place to avoid the issuing of unvetted releases. On Tuesday, SAA released a statement saying they’re ready to resume domestic flights in June. The BRPs insist that the cessation of flights remains as is until SAA has a better sense of what the Level 3 lockdown means in terms of domestic air travel. It says the airline also needs to consider what the opening of the skies will mean from a commercial and load factor perspective. It says SAA’s future funding also remains a key variable in all of the above considerations. The BRPs say the statement has created unfair expectation on the relevant stakeholders, including SAA’s customers as well as employees, who are on unpaid absence as a result of the travel ban which led to the halting of the company’s operations and compounded its financial distress. The BRPs says they will publish a Business Rescue Plan for the airline as instructed by SCOPA earlier in May. Retrenchment of SAA employees Meanwhile, the Business Rescue Practitioners for SAA say they are going to seek an urgent date for the hearing of their appeal against the Labour Court judgment earlier this month. The Court found that their move to retrench SAA employees was unfair. The Labour Court granted them leave to appeal the judgment on Monday.
