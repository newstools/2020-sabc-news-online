Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu will hand over houses to over 70 families in Wilgespruit, Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg on Sunday. The families have been living in tents in a plot for about four years. The families had complained about the struggles during rains and cold weather. Sisulu’s spokesperson, McIntosh Polela, says this community was forcefully removed from a farm. “What the minister has done is to approach a businessman to donate houses for them. These are wooden houses that would last between 15 and 20 years and now these people are going to be moved from tents to those houses today and their dignity restored. The minister has been there twice and promised that when people are ready to move she will be there to personally hand over and she’s fulfilling that promise,” says Polela.   In mid-May, Sisulu said that women and children should be accorded preferential treatment when it comes to the allocation of housing and access to water. Sisulu was handing over a consignment of water tanks and temporary mobile show houses to scores of Mamelodi hostel residents in the east of Pretoria. The donation was a joint venture with the Danish government, other government departments, the City of Tshwane and Rand Water.
