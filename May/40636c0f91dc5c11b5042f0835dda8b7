Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has lauded the role played by South African Airways (SAA) staff in efforts to rescue the airline. Gordhan says in discussions with trade unions, they have agreed to take salary cuts of up to 40% to ensure SAA’s survival. The Minister briefed the joint Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises and the Select Committee on Public Enterprises and Communications during a virtual joint meeting on Wednesday evening. He said Government will be meeting with the Business Rescue Practitioners (BRPs) in the next two days on the restructuring of the airline. “In the next 48 hours we will meet with the BRPs to examine the finances and to give as much continuity after the May 8 deadline. There should be no further sale of assets and no move to liquidation if many alternatives can be pursued.”
