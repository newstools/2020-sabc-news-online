Debbie Budlender, who runs the Denis Goldberg House of Hope in Hout Bay, says an exhibition celebrating the life and contributions of the late struggle stalwart, will be set up in Hout Bay. Goldberg died of cancer last week in Cape Town, at the age of 87. Budlender was speaking during Goldberg’s memorial service, which was held online. This video takes a look at the life of Denis Goldberg  “In Denis’s eyes, arts and culture is probably the most powerful vehicle for bringing people together. He founded the Denis Goldberg Legacy Foundation Trust to give momentum to that vehicle, especially for the children and youth across the different communities in Hout Bay. The trust’s core project is the Denis Goldberg House of Hope, an arts and culture education centre that will be built on the grounds of the Hout Bay Museum. Denis’s large art collection will be housed there as well as an exhibition celebrating his life and contributions,” says Budlender. Meanwhile, Rivonia trialist Andrew Mlangeni has thanked the family of Goldberg for sharing him with South Africa. Mlangeni was speaking during Goldberg’s memorial service. “I think we have to congratulate comrade Denis for that great sacrifice that he has made in order to help South Africa to get where it is today. Dennis has sacrificed, comrades, for us to be where we are today. We want to thank his family for giving us Denis,” says Mlangeni. In this video, Ronnie Kasrils pays tribute to Denis Goldberg
