The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) says the Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga will release a report on Monday on whether schools are ready to reopen. The unions held a meeting with the minister on Saturday where she committed to engage with them on their concerns. Motshekga announced on the 30th of April that School Management Teams should report to schools on Monday. However, SADTU General Secretary Mugwena Maluleke has advised their members not to report for duty until their grievances have been attended to. “We cannot risk their lives by taking them to schools that have not been disinfected. Schools that have got no cleaners. Schools that have got no masks and sanitisers. So we will hear the progress on Monday from the minister,” says Maluleke. Meanwhile, the National Professional Teachers’ Organisation (NAPTOSA) has appealed to Motshekga not to put the lives of School Management Teams in danger. The union says the department is not ready to receive the officials. It says schools have not been deep cleaned and disinfected as yet. NAPTOSA Executive Director, Basil Manuel, says they will allow the reopening of schools only when the department has ensured that schools are safe. “The things that are outstanding are many. First of all, we start with cleaning the places and of course, the delivery of PPEs hasn’t happened. The masks are not there. The chemicals to clean the places regularly is not there. The staff hasn’t been trained. We have indicated that as NAPTOSA we will not accept that these things are not in place. So none of the provinces are opening schools tomorrow,” says Manuel.
