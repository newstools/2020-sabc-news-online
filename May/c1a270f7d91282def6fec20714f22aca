Seven security guards at the Lindela Repatriation Centre, west of Johannesburg, have been arrested in connection with the recent escape of 37 deportees. They have been charged with aiding the escapees after leaving their posts. However, they have denied this saying they left because they were not being paid for overtime. The security guards allegedly tipped-off the deportees, who then scaled the walls. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele says the seven have been released on warning, but will appear in court on Tuesday. “I can confirm that the security guards were on duty when the 37 deportees escaped from Lindela. A case of aiding to escape was registered and since then the police have been investing the matter and today in the early morning the suspects were brought to Krugersdorp police station by a lawyer. Seven of them were brought to the police station and they are released on warning and they will be appearing on Tuesday in Krugersdorp Magistrate’s Court.”   In the video below, seven security guards were charged with aiding in the escape of 37 deportees:
