The National Assembly will meet next week to hold its first hybrid sitting since the start of the national lockdown regulations due to the coronavirus pandemic. It says all political parties represented in the National Assembly have agreed on this method as part of enforcing the oversight constitutional obligation on the executive. On Friday, Parliament marked its 100th virtual meeting of its oversight committees – in what has been described as a significant milestone to fulfill its tasks during the current crisis. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the hybrid approach will consist of both virtual and physical sessions – coupled with oral questions to various ministers.   He says the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) is expected to hold its first virtual meeting in June. The NCOP is expected to consider the Division of Revenue Bill which was passed by the National Assembly in March. “As it is agreed upon by parties, the National Assembly will hold its first hybrid sitting which means both physical and virtual sitting on the 27th of May for questions to ministers.” “Particularly those ministers that are heading departments that are central to the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCOP on the other hand will hold its first virtual sitting on June 2 to consider the division of revenue bill. You will remember that this bill was approved by the National Assembly in March. We are anticipating at least 47 meetings of committees of the two houses this week to take place on the virtual platforms,” explains Mothapo.   A hybrid meeting refers to a group of people attending a meeting together at the same location/place, whilst other participants can join the meeting by conference call or web conference.
