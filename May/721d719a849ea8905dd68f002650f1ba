The Northern Cape Education Department says a total of 338 of the 557 schools in the province have been disinfected. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to give an update on Tuesday afternoon on the state of readiness for the re-opening of schools. The Northern Cape has the lowest number of positive Coronavirus cases standing at 37. The Education Department in the province says it’s ready to welcome back learners at schools. The Department’s Lehuma Ntuane says: “It has been completed followed by Pixley Ka Seme. The remaining districts have smaller school number, therefore we are on track.”  Awaiting clarity Some civil society organisations say they are keenly awaiting clarity from the Minister of Basic Education on how schools will be prepared to open amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools have been closed for more than six weeks as government battles to contain the virus. To get schools ready to operate during the lockdown, precautions must be implemented. Motheo Brodie, from Section 27, says they have concerns that the minister must clarify. “We are hoping for clarity regarding learners on feeding schemes. Also more about PPE for learners and staff and vitally the rollout of sanitation for more than 4000 that only have pit toilets and lack running water.” – Additional reporting Zalene Merrington
