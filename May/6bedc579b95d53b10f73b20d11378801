AbaThembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo has asked all his children, including acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo , to undergo DNA tests to prove that they are indeed his children. Dalindyebo has reportedly disowned Azenathi until he undergoes the test and has also requested Azenathi to vacate the Bumbane Great Place. In March, after having been paroled from an East London prison, King Dalindyebo went on the rampage at the Bumbane Great Place – demanding that Azenathi leave. Dalindyebo’s spokesperson, Prince Mthunzi Ngonyama, says Azenathi was the only child who refused to undergo DNA testing. “The King has decided earlier this year, to conduct a DNA tests that will involve all his children not only Azenathi. While he was still persuading [him] he got some tip off from someone that has some information that seems to be very detailed which proved what some of [the] suspicions that king had about his son. He was convinced that he is not his son but he has now said that if he wants to further verify this, Azenathi can go for a DNA test but there’s never been good cooperation from his [Azenathi’s] side,” explains Ngonyama. AbaThembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo arrested In March, Dalindyebo was arrested at the Bumbane Great Place in Mthatha after he allegedly went on a rampage, attacking family members with pangas, bushknives and axes.

He was appointed to this role after winning a court battle against his uncle Prince Mthandeni Mankunku Dalindyebo, over the abaThembu kingship. The pair subsequently made peace in 2018. Dalindyebo has accused government of fueling divisions between himself and his son Prince Azenathi.
