Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says he has decided to self-quarantine after coming into contact with the late eNCA cameraman, Lungile Tom. Tom died from COVID-19 related complications on Wednesday morning. He was admitted to hospital in Cape Town on Sunday. Winde says he had a one-on-one interview with Tom recently, being in close range for some time. He says he is deemed a close contact and will now self-quarantine. Winde says, “After doing our own screening and testing, with myself being involved in an interview last Thursday where Lungile was present and the cameraman in the interview, it is prudent for me to also follow those rules and so for the next seven days.” Below is a statement by Alan Winde: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889932-Premier-Alan-Winde-Update-on-Coronavirus-COVID.js", {
