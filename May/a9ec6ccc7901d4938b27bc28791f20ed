Parliament has lost one of its own to COVID-19. Amos Komeni had tested positive for the virus on Thursday. “We are shocked and saddened by this; we all hoped he will conquer this and be discharged from the hospital. This sudden turn of events has all of us gutted”, reads a statement from Parliament’s Presiding Officers – led by National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and the National Council of Provinces Chairperson, Amos Masondo. Komeni, who was famously known as Bra A, was 60 years-old. He was employed in the office of the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Lechesa Tsenoli, since May 2014 as Project Administrator. Tsenoli says Komeni served his office with utmost dedication and diligence. “This invisible enemy has robbed us of a humble gentle giant, a dignified professional who was a role model for many younger employees. He was a gentleman who always went beyond the call of duty. He was an also activist who dedicated his efforts and time in various community upliftment projects. He served in various structures and was an active member of the South African Communist Party,” adds Tsenoli. Parliament’s Presiding Officers have conveyed their condolences to Komeni’s family, friends, colleagues and everyone whose life he touched. The Presiding Officers have also extended their sympathies to all families that have lost their loved one to the virus. “We continue to urge South Africans to put all these families in their thoughts and prayers for strength and healing during this difficult time. We also wish a swift recovery to all infected. Let’s all continue to observe the regulations and always remember to adhere to all hygiene guidelines as part of our lifestyle,” reads the statement. The Deputy Speaker will, on behalf of the Presiding Officers, visit Komeni’s family on Saturday. At least 103 South Africans have died due to coronavirus, while more than 5 000 others are battling the disease.
