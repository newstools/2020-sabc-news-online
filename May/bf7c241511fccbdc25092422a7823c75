Springbok Pharmacy in Alberton has been shutdown after two workers tested positive for COVID-19. This as management initially failed to notify health authorities. Ekurhuleni MMC for Community Safety, Frans Mmoko and officials from the Department of Health have met with the management of the pharmacy to discuss reports of two positive cases of COVID-19.  Mmoko has expressed disappointment over the pharmacy’s failure to report the cases to the relevant health authorities in time. “We advised them to close for the rest of today, tomorrow and Sunday to clean the place, screen and test their members but as well as disinfection. I’m disappointed that people are saying they were advised not to say a word about it. Maybe it’s only a sheer allegation but if the store decided to keep mum about it, keeping quiet from the authorities they must just share with the authorities. It doesn’t help to keep quiet and continue with business as usual,” says Mmoko. In this video, two cases of COVID-19 in Springbok Pharmacy in Alberton are confirmed
