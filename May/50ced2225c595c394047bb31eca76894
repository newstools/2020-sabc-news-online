Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to release a report about the readiness of schools to operate in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak on Tuesday. Schools in South Africa have been closed since March after  President Cyril Ramaphosa announced several measures to slow the pandemic. Teachers have had to find alternative ways of engaging with pupils and help them continue to learn at home. Parents and caregivers have also had to step in and assist their children with daily lessons. The virus has sparked anxiety and panic among learners and parents alike with several attempts to reopen schools not materialising. In the effort to save the school calendar, the Department of Basic Education introduced the COVID-19 Learner Support programme aimed at limiting the impact of the lockdown on the school calendar. The virtual online learning programme is one of the initiatives undertaken by the department. It allows pupils from all grades to access studying and reading materials. Radio stations are also broadcasting lessons to provide curriculum support lessons to learners in various grades, including Early Childhood Development (ECD). The graph below shows when programmes are aired on radio:  Some of the subjects covered, include Maths, Physical Sciences, English First Additional Language (FAL), Life Sciences, and Accounting. A variety of African languages are also covered under the ECD basket. Learners are encouraged to check their local listings for the exact slots for radio.

The department has also launched a television channel to broadcast educational support for learners and teachers on the Openview HD (OVHD) platform – channel 122. Below is a timetable of when the educational programmes are aired on TV: The department has also compiled a list of educational resources pupils can use for extra support.  The Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga addressed the country in April on the sectors recovery plans and the reopening of schools amid the lockdown. The department has encouraged setting routines and having a designated time to study at home. It says this is important because it gives children a sense of security and helps them develop patterns of self-discipline. “A predictable routine allows children to feel safe, and to develop a sense of mastery in a safe secure environment. As this sense of mastery is strengthened, it then persuades a child to tackle larger challenges. Helping children feel safe and ready to take on new challenges is one of the parent’s responsibilities. Structure and routines allow children to internalise constructive habits and function well with others. Establishing a family routine with regular mealtimes, bedtimes, homework time, and outdoor play and exercise time is important.”
