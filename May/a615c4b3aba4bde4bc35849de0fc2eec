The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has outlined the process for the application of the COVID-19 social relief distress grant of R350 for people who are currently unemployed. The grant was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa amid the nationwide lockdown – as part of the R500 billion economic and social relief measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sassa sokesperson Paseka Letsatsi outlines the process to receive the grant. “When they make an application, we do take them through a particular process to give us an outcome and demonstrate whether the person is receiving any source of income and so on.” ”When you make an application, there are certain questions that we ask you and as you fill up the information, you [we] are able to determine whether you qualify or not. It is a very tight process and we focus on those who are in need,” explains Letsatsi. In the video below, Sassa spokesperson unpacks government’s social relief grant…
