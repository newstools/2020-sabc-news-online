South Africans are waiting with bated breath for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Sunday night address. The President is expected to announce further loosening of the lockdown when he addresses the nation at 7pm. Most sectors of the economy are expected to return to some level of operation if the country moves to alert level 3 of the nationwide lockdown at the end of the month. Mining and manufacturing sectors are expected to return to full operation with 100% staff complement. Speculation is also rife that a ban on alcohol and cigarettes sales is likely to be partially lifted. The ban is blamed for harming the economy with concerns that illicit trade in banned goods had gained traction The move to level 3 will come as South Africa’s COVID-19 infection rate continues to climb. The country has recorded over 400 COVID-19 related deaths with over 20 000 infections.
