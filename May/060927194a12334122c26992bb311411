Government has warned that it will fine those found in public without wearing a face mask. It is now compulsory for all South Africans to wear a mask under stage four lockdown regulations. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says no person is allowed to use public transport without wearing a mask. Durban based attorney Theasen Pillay says, “My advice to anyone is … from the time you leave home, put on a mask. Regardless of where you are going, in whatever mode [of transport] you are traveling in. If you are at work, if you are in public in any forum, until the time that you return [home], keep the mask on.” “It will not only remove the risk of a very hefty fine, but it will drastically reduce the chance of infection, which is ultimately the goal of this entire proceedings and our lifestyle currently.” Social distancing remains a concern Long queues have again marred payment of social grants to pensioners and people with disabilities in Mpumalanga.
