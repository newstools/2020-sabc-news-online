AfriForumâ€™s Private Prosecutions Unit says former Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions, Nomgcobo Jiba, will face prosecution. The unit says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has informed it in writing about the intention to put Jiba on trial. In a statement, AfriForum says the about-turn came after advocate Gerrie Nel threatened the NPA with a supervisory court order in November 2019 to take a decision on the prosecution of Jiba. Earlier, Nel said he would be prosecuting Jiba for fraud and perjury on behalf of then General Johan Booysen, the former Head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal. The NPA could not be reached for comment. President Cyril Ramaphosa fired Jiba from the NPA in April 2019 after an inquiry found her unfit to remain in her job. The decision was upheld by the National Assembly in December the same year. Jiba was found to have failed to uphold the NPA Act, thus bringing the prosecuting authority into disrepute. A prosecutorial overreach in instituting racketeering charges against Booysen was at the centre of the damning findings against Jiba. Booysen had been accused of being involved in the Cato Manor death squad, its alleged existence has also been a subject of public debate and controversy.
