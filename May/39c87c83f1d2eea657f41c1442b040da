KwaZulu-Natal police are questioning six men in connection with the disappearance of a teenager from Tongaat, north of Durban. Nduduzo Andile Mbuthu was reported missing last week. A video, showing the 16-year-old Mbuthu injured and bleeding after allegedly being beaten, has gone viral on social media. Police divers have retrieved his body from a river in the area.  It is alleged that he was kidnapped and assaulted after being accused of stealing alcohol. The community of Hambanathi gathered outside Mbuthu’s home to pray with his family.  The angry residents also gathered at the house of a person believed to be involved in the kidnapping of the grade 12 learner, threatening to burn the building down. The crowd dispersed after being warned by police.  Ward Councillor Zanele Khumalo says people are demanding to be addressed by Police Minister Bheki Cele. “They are not happy with the way the police station handled this matter. They are calling on the police minister to come address them. They have made that call. What is really painful is that police kept saying that there is insufficient evidence. All the suspects have been taken in for questioning. The community needs to calm down,” says Khumalo. In the video below, the Tongaat community searches for Mbuthu:
