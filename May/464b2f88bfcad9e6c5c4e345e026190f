Some private schools in the country are facing closure as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The National Alliance of Independent School Association (NAISA) says the lockdown has negatively affected the finances of independent schools. It says parents are struggling to keep up with payments due to a lack of economic activity. Independent schools’ finances have been hard hit by the lockdown:  JSE-listed private education group Advtech has reported a 20% drop in school fee collections for April, while Curro Holdings has offered schools fees discounts ranging from 10 to 15% for accounts that are in good standing.    NAISA secretary-general Ebrahim Ansur says the situation is dire as 90% of the income of independent schools comes from school fees. “There are some independent schools which are a little more fortunate in that, the parents pay fees upfront at the beginning of the year. But in the large number of independent schools that we have around the country, parents pay either on a monthly basis or on a termly basis. Because of the lockdown and the restrictions of economic activity, payment of school fees has been very, very slow indeed and many independent schools are struggling to survive.” In the video below,  Confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa:  President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated caution in the progression to Level 3 lockdown regulations:
