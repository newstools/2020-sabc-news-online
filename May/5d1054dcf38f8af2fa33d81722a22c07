Former Rivonia trialist, Andrew Mlangeni, says it is a pity that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown regulations overshadow a proper send-off for fellow struggle stalwart, Denis Goldberg. Goldberg died of cancer at the age of 87 in Cape Town, last week. A memorial service for Goldberg is expected to be held on SABC online platforms on Friday. The proceedings will be live-streamed and a minimum number of people, including the speakers, will participate directly in the online service. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to give the keynote address during the virtual ceremony. Mlangeni, the 94-year-old African National Congress (ANC) Stalwart, says many are taking their freedom for granted that people like Goldberg fought for. “He made a great contribution. The freedom that we are today enjoying is as a result of the contribution that comrade Goldberg has made together with many other comrades who have passed away. So, we have lost a great man, a great leader and I don’t know if we will be able to replace him.” Last week, President Ramaphosa ordered the country’s flags to fly at half-mast at every station in the country to observe four days of national mourning for Goldberg. He also said South Africans could honour him in silent prayer. The video below captures the life and times of Denis Goldberg:
