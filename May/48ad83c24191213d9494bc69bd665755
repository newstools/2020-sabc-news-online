Public behaviour will determine the infection rate Public Health Medicine Registrar at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Velile Ngidi, says ultimately, public behaviour will determine whether the rate of infection increases or not. Ngidi says, “The expectation is that as we reduce the level of lockdown and peoples movements are less restricted, we are expecting an increase in transmission but the hope is that people have had time to get used to non-pharmaceutical interventions like hand washing, hand sanitizers, physical distancing that is what we are relying on, human behaviour that people do what they are supposed to be doing.” INFOGRAPHIC: SA COVID-19 statistics:  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 3329 2349 3306 225 144 134 111 51 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 28 May 2020 77 3 0 1 DEATHS 8 406 31 50 1 CONFIRMED CASES | 27 403 DEATHS | 577 TESTS CONDUCTED | 655 723 RECOVERIES | 14 370 CLOSED CASES | 14 947 17 754 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); COVID-19 cases in Chris Hani District Eastern Cape health authorities say poor lockdown compliance in the Chris Hani District has contributed significantly to the rapid increase in the number of patients in the province.
