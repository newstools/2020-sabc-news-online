The family of Denis Goldberg and the Denis Goldberg Legacy Foundation Trust have announced that the memorial service of the struggle stalwart will take place this coming Friday in the afternoon. The memorial service will be held online due to the lockdown restrictions. The proceedings will be livestreamed and a minimum number of people, including the speakers, will participate directly in the online service. According to the family spokesperson, the cremation is organised as a very small and private affair. After the lockdown is over, the ANC will organise a full national memorial, which will allow a larger number of people to participate directly. Goldberg succumbed to cancer this past week at the age of 87. He was one of the only two surviving Rivonia Treason trialists. He spent 22 years in prison after being sentenced in June 1964 to four life terms. Meanwhile, the family has thanked everyone for all the messages received at this difficult time.
