The African National Congress (ANC) is urging South Africans to support the decisions of the Cabinet and the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC). The party’s appeal follows recent criticism on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Minister, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, on alleged proposed extension of a ban on the sale of cigarettes, tobacco related products and alcohol. “ANC notes with dismay the continuing attacks on Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for diligently carrying out her duties as the Minister responsible for the coordination of our country’s national mitigation efforts, in terms of the Disaster Management Act of 2020. It is entirely unacceptable that there are evidently wedge drivers, who are in the service of certain businesses. They maliciously attack and undermine our leaders. ” said the party in a statement issued on Sunday. The governing party has also moved to remind South Africans that Cabinet and NCCC decisions are not taken by individuals. “The discussions are supposed to be confidential, until the final decisions of the collective are publicly announced. It must always be remembered that the decisions of Cabinet and the NCCC are collectively taken, and should never be individualised,”  the statement added. The ANC  has on the other hand praised government’s response to COVID-19 and its impacts thus far. “The ANC welcomes the diligent manner that Cabinet and the NCCC, under the leadership of President Ramaphosa, are carrying out their difficult duties. We fully support the decisions that have been taken. We call on those who are trying to undermine Cabinet and the NCCC, and the decisions that they collectively take, to forthwith cease with their selfish and unpatriotic behavior.” Below is the governing party’s full statement on the matter:  The below graph is the latest COVID-19 stats in the country:   Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 2633 1777 2569 196 124 81 97 40 UNALLOCATED 0 13826 AS AT 23 May 2020 58 3 0 1 DEATHS 6 261 29 48 1 CONFIRMED CASES | 21 343 DEATHS | 407 TESTS CONDUCTED |  564 370 RECOVERIES | 10 104 CLOSED CASES | 10 511 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
