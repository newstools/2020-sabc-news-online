The Western Cape has recorded an additional eight COVID-19 deaths, bringing the total number of deaths from the coronavirus in the province to 166. The province has more than 10 000 confirmed cases and with close to 4000 recoveries. Premier Alan Winde says currently 424 people are in hospital with 111 in ICU. Winde says, “I wanted to say, as we reach the 10 000 case mark in the province, according to the specialists, we are doubling every eight days and I want to say we need to remain calm. We need to understand that we put our systems and our responses in place and we all just need to make sure that we follow the golden rules of social distancing, of staying home as much as possible, of washing your hands, sanitising and masks when you go out.”   Meanwhile, South Africa now has 16 433 COVID-19 infections and 286 related deaths. This means that the country recorded 918 new cases and 22 deaths overnight. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has urged South Africans who are regarded as high-risk groups to take extra precautions and avoid possible exposure to COVID-19. The elderly and people living with chronic diseases like HIV, diabetes and hypertension are among those advised to take extra measures to avoid COVID-19 exposure.
