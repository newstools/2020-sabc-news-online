The South African First Forum has objected to the reopening of schools until a proper plan for the safety of the learners and teachers is in place. Convenor of the Forum advocate Rod Solomons, says they have written to President Cyril Ramaphosa, highlighting their concerns. Solomons says more than 27 000 people signed a petition asking government to take into consideration the concerns of parents, teachers, and learners. He says, “Parents indicated they will not send their children back to school and teachers should not return until the health and safety concerns are fully guaranteed.” “We also call on the President to talk sense to the Minister of Basic Education to come up with a sensible and credible plan for our schools, ” adds Solomons.  Meanwhile, the Federation of School Governing Bodies says it supports a phased reopening of schools across the country as long as the necessary precautions are taken to protect learners and staff from the coronavirus, schools can open. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to address the nation on Tuesday on the reopening of schools across the country, following a special meeting of the Council of Education Ministers on Monday, which included the Minister together with the nine provincial education MECs. The federations CEO Paul Colditz says Motshekga also needs to reassure parents that it is safe for their children to return. Colditz says the federation believes it’s the responsibility of the Department of Basic Education and the provincial departments to provide schools with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE’s) ensuring the safety of learners but also teachers at the school.
