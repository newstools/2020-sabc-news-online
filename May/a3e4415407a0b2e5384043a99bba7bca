Mexico registered 2 414 new cases of the coronavirus and 155 more deaths on Monday, the Health Ministry said, raising its overall number of infections since Mexico recorded its first cases in late February to 51 633. The country has tallied 5 332 overall deaths from the virus. Meanwhile, the country issued guidelines on Monday for restarting operations in the automotive, mining and construction sectors, pushing ahead with reopening the economy despite a growing national toll from the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns about unsafe work sites. The moves to loosen restrictions follow growing pressure from the United States to reopen factories that are vital to supply chains of US-based businesses, especially in the vast automotive sector. Mexico’s reopening plans have drawn criticism from some politicians worried that the still-rising pandemic tide in Latin America makes it unsafe to send more people to work. Mexico’s guidelines, published overnight, require companies to submit to authorities health protocols for exiting the coronavirus lockdown. Firms will then be told within 72 hours if they can resume operations.
