More South Africans have lost their jobs and income as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is according to a survey by Stats SA called Wave 2 that looked into the impact of COVID-19 on employment, income and hunger. It revealed that 8,1% of respondents lost their jobs or had to close businesses so far, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the report, almost 9 in 10 respondents who were employed before the national lockdown remained employed during the lockdown. The survey found a decrease in the proportion of respondents who usually derive their income from salaries and wages, as well as from own business during the lockdown. It shows people are turning to their savings and borrowing to make end meets. The results indicated an increase in the proportion of those who derived their incomes from savings and investments. There is also an increase in those that get loans from friends, family and businesses as well as claims from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). The survey further indicated that about a quarter of respondents reported that their incomes decreased during the national lockdown. Over half of the respondents say their income had stayed the same.
