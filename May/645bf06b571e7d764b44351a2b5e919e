Residents of Spain’s island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands enjoyed the sun and beach on Sunday as Spaniards revealed in their new-found freedom this weekend after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased to allow healthy adults out to play sports and take walks for the first time in seven weeks. People will be allowed to take short walks and play sports from 6am to 10am and 20:00pm to 23:00pm Between midday and 19:00pm will be reserved for young children, with the remaining slots set aside for elderly and vulnerable people. The relaxation of exercise restrictions is one of the first steps in a four-phase plan to gradually reopen the country by the end of June. Last weekend, children under 14 were allowed out for an hour a day of supervised activity. From Monday, businesses that operate by appointments, such as hairdressers and beauty salons, will resume limited services. Spain’s death toll from the new coronavirus rose by 164 to 25 264 on Sunday, the health ministry said. Confirmed cases of the virus rose to 217 466, from 216 582 on Saturday.
