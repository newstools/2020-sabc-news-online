The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has given the assurance that there will be increased capacity of staff at offices across the country this week. This as many people express disappointment at not being able to register themselves or their children for various grants including the COVID-19 unemployment relief fund. There have been long queues at SASSA offices across the country in the past few days, after child support grant applications were opened. Most returned home without being assisted after spending hours in the queue. SASSA Chief Executive Officer, Busisiwe Memela-Khambula, says it is not necessary for people to go to their offices to collect their payments because it is being deposited in their bank accounts. “On the payment side I think it’s very important to clarify this, we pay the money of the beneficiary into their bank account and there’s no need for people to come to us.” “Like everywhere else in the country, we have been allowed to bring only a third of our staff into our branches, which therefore means that the people can take a limited number of people into the branch. Hence, we’ve decided that we are going to call all our staff back, others will work inside the office or others will work outside this coming week so that they can manage the queues,” says Memela-Khambula.
