The Special Investigating Unit says it will investigate each and every transaction and tender awarded during the national lockdown across the country for the procurement of essential items. The COVID-19 pandemic has put pressure on government to procure essential items needed to fight the disease but there are concerns that the procurement process could give rise to an increase in fraud and corruption. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says they have also concluded the investigation into the 30-million rand information technology tender issued by the Gauteng e-Government department. He says the report has been given to Premier David Makhura, who has promised to release it by the end of the month. Kganyago says most of the complaints of the tenders come from provinces such as the Eastern Cape and Gauteng. “In particular it is from the eastern cape and some from Gauteng in Limpopo and so on we have then since decided that we are going to do one proclamation what we call national COVID-19 proclamation that will then look at each and every transaction that was done. But we have also as the SIU been asked for example by the Gauteng premier to go and look at the R30 million tender that was awarded, the report was given to the premier.”
