Eskom’s energy-intensive users can expect an increase in electricity accounts as we enter the winter season next month. Large industrial, municipal and agricultural customers may see an increase in their electricity bill in the peak season as customers use more electricity for heating. The National Energy Regulator ( Nersa) approved a standard tariff increase of 8,7 % for Eskom’s direct customers from 1 April, while municipalities can expect to see a 6,9%  increase from 1 July. The seasonal tariff is only applicable to municipalities and not to residential customers unless they voluntarily opt for it. “The peak rate in winter is R3,62 and in summer is R1,18. So you can see the difference, but in the standard periods, the difference is a lot less in the off-peak periods the difference is minimal, it’s really in the peak periods where the price is very expensive. This is not generally applied to residential customers unless they want to,” says Corporate Specialist for retail pricing at Eskom, Shirley Salvodi.
