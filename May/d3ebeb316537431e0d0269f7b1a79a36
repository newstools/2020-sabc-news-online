Public Health Systems in Africa are under extreme pressure as governments reconfigure their health systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organisation Africa Region estimates that up to 190 000 people on the continent could die due to COVID-19 co-morbidities. The world body has warned the region not to neglect existing health programmes, as they respond to the new viral infection. Africa has 69 000 confirmed cases – with 2386 resulting in death. We are now joined via Skype by the WHO AFRO’s Deputy Incident Manager for COVID-19 Response in Africa – Dr. Richard Mihigo.
