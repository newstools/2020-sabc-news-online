South Africa has entered into level four of the coronavirus lockdown and people are required to wear masks when they go out in public â€“ among other requirements. Level four includes an easing of regulations around the movement of people and a slight opening-up of economic activity.  One of the restrictions that have been lifted is exercising. You can only jog, run, walk or cycle from 6am to 9am in the morning within five kilometres of where you reside,- but not in organised groups.  You are also required to wear a cloth mask whenever you go into public places to minimise the spread of the virus. Various economic activities such as mining and transportation are slowly being phased in.  The sale of alcohol and cigarettes are still prohibited. And the strict part of the regulations is the introduction of a curfew between 8pm and 5am everyday. This means you are not allowed to be on the streets between 8pm tonight and 5am tomorrow morning, on a daily basis.- unless you are an essential worker.  Meanwhile, the Health Ministry says the number of coronavirus cases in South Africa has increased by 297 to 5 647. This is an increase of five and a half percent. The number of fatalities from COVID 19 remains at 103. The Western Cape has the most cases at 2 342 followed by Gauteng on 1 446. More than 10 000 tests were conducted in the last 24 hour period. Government has been ramping up testing at public labs in the last few weeks.
