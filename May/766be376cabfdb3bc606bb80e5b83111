The Department of Correctional Services (DCS ) has recorded three new COVID-19 cases bringing the total number to 169. The individuals involved are the department’s officials. The Eastern Cape has the highest number of cases, 101 with 65 inmates and 36 officials. The Western Cape follows with 53 cases, 5o officials and three inmates. Earlier the Eastern Cape Correctional Services Department raised concerns about the stigmatisation of its officials. It said staff members have been turned away by some shop owners while people leave shops when prison warders walk in. Department spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, says they continue to test and screen officials and inmates as well as families of officials at all centres. “We continue to urge the communities to work with us and stop stigmatizing our officials as if they are the carriers of the virus. There is nothing wrong with COVID-19. Once you have tested positive you must be given support so that you recover and we have seen people recovering. Stigmatising officials doesn’t assist anyone, instead, it is polarising society.  We urge people out there to all do the right thing. Let us fight COVID-19 as a unity.”  The graph below gives the provincial breakdown of the COVID-19 numbers :   Loading… (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
