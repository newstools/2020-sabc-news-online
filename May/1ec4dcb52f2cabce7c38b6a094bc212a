There are concerns that not all companies have the capacity to protect their employees from COVID-19. Between 1.3 and 1.5 million people are expected to return to work from Monday as the lockdown restrictions are eased. Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi on Sunday advised businesses to conduct risk assessments before resuming operations. He also said they should screen their workers for symptoms of COVID-19. Labour analyst Mamokgethi Molopyane says some companies will have some challenges. “It’s going to be difficult because not all the companies have the equipment. The health sector has it for screening people but companies do not have,” she adds. “As the Minister was saying, it will be a little discomfort for some and he highlighted the importance of them spending to ensure that workers are safe and have masks and protective equipment,” explains Molopyane.
