Divisions have emerged in Kenya’s ruling party Jubilee on Monday after President Uhuru Kenyatta who is the party leader replaced his deputy’s allies in the leadership of the senate. This comes a day after Kenyatta signed a coalition agreement with the late President Moi’s party – KANU. The weekend agreement as well today’s decision by Kenyatta to replace Deputy President William Ruto’s allies in the Senate will only add to the bad blood between the two leaders, ahead of Kenyatta’s retirement in 2022. Ruto who has expressed his interest in the presidency has found himself alienated from the decision-making of the party and the country since Uhuru signed a peace pact with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. At a parliamentary group meeting for the senate, Kenyatta replaced the senate’s leadership with a senator from the late President Moi’s party, KANU.  Ruto’s allies did not attend the meeting held at State House in Nairobi and was chaired by Kenyatta.
