Lesotho’s police say they will rearrest murder accused and former First Lady, Maesiah Thabane. The country’s Appeal Court revoked Thabane’s bail earlier on Friday. The former First Lady was granted bail in February under unclear circumstances by Lesotho’s Acting Chief Justice, Maseforo Mahase. Thabane is accused of being involved in the assassination of her husband’s then estranged wife, Lipolelo Thabane, in 2017. Maesiah Thabane hid in South Africa for a few weeks before turning herself in. In the video below, SABC’s Noma Bolani takes a look at Maesiah’s background:  In Friday’s ruling, the Appeal Court Judge President Kananelo Mosito found that the granting of bail to Thabane was highly irregular and erroneous. He ruled that the murder accused had a history of fleeing the law and concerns of intimidating the witness was legitimate. Mosito said Thabane would have to petition the court again for a new bail hearing. Police say they are now awaiting formal documentation that will allow them to take Thabane into custody until her next court appearance. Veteran politician Thomas Thabane, Maesiah’s husband, resigned last week Tuesday amid pressure for him to exit office after police named him and his wife as suspects in Lipolelo’s murder. Lipolelo Thabane was shot dead in her car in June 2017 two days before her husband’s inauguration. She had reportedly refused him a divorce. Thabane married Maesaiah two months after her death.
