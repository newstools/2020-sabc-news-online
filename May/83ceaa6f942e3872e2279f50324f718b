The South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA) says there is currently an inadequate stock of diesel in the country. In a statement, the organisation says since the easing of lockdown restrictions, the opening of the economy has resulted in a more rapid recovery than expected. “There has been a dramatic increase in demand for diesel. Stock rationing is been implemented to manage demand and to preserve stock. In addition, there has also been an opportunistic increase in demand for petrol however, it is manageable despite the strain on supply.” SAPIA says unplanned shutdowns are also a contributing factor to the inadequate stocks. It is however promising that things will normalise on Monday as both refineries in Durban are currently starting up and on spec production is expected this weekend.
