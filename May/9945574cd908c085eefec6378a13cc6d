The Correctional Services Department has expressed concern over the stigmatisation of its officials in the Eastern Cape. It says staff members have been turned away by some shop owners while people leave shops when prison warders walk in. The provincial department earlier confirmed 93 coronavirus cases, amongst them are officials and inmates. Another inmate earlier died at the East London prison, bringing to two the fatalities at the prison. Department spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, says they continue to test and screen officials and inmates as well as families of officials at all centres. “We continue to urge the communities to work with us and stop stigmatizing our officials as if they are the carriers of the virus. There is nothing wrong with COVID-19. Once you have tested positive you must be given support so that you recover and we have seen people recovering. Stigmatising officials doesn’t assist anyone, instead, it is polarising society.  We urge people out there to all do the right thing. Let us fight COVID-19 as a unity.” South Africa currently has 7 22o coronavirus cases and the Eastern Cape accounts to 838 cases.  Below is a graph with the current COVID-19 statistics in SA:  Loading… (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Author-Busi Mantashe
