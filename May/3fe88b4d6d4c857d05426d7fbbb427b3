There’s no update on the death toll which was at three during the last announcement. Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo says, “It’s important that our prevention measures do work, then we’ve got to look to say where there are positive cases possibly – what could be the gaps there and how best do we close those gaps. We still remain on the fundamental point to say let’s roll out prevention measures because that’s one of the viable options which will assist us, so that’s what we are doing. We have even employed a panel of medical experts to really assist us, even to look at our prevention control in our centres. In Correctional Services in general we have a total of 388 positive cases, this will talk to inmates and officials and over 93 recoveries.” President Ramaphosa announced last week that 19 000 inmates would be released to deal with overcrowding in prisons and to give authorities a chance to better control the spread of the virus.
