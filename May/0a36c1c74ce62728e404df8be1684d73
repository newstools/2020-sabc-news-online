The Southern African Development Community ( SADC) delegation that was sent to Lesotho to mediate the situation between outgoing Prime Minister Tom Thabane and opposition parties has been commended for brokering a peaceful exit agreement. The delegation was led by former South African Cabinet Minister, Jeff Radebe. Lesotho’s Finance Minister, Moeketsi Majoro, will take over from Thabane who announced his resignation earlier on Tuesday during an address to the nation. Majoro will be sworn in on Wednesday. “The delegation that comprised some officials and ministers from RSA (Republic of South Africa) came into Lesotho just to broker a deal so that the Prime Minister could have a dignified exit. They have done a great job because the transition that we are going through now has been a very peaceful one. This is the first time in the history of this country that a sitting Prime Minister volunteers to retire. The deal was put before parliament and finally, the deal was unanimously passed by both houses of parliament and it was given royal assent by his majesty,” says Thabane’s Senior Private Secretary, Thabo Thakalekwala. Thabane says he is stepping aside to make way for young people. “He will only relinquish all his powers tomorrow when the new prime minister will be sworn in, so until then he is still the prime minister even though he has tendered his resignation his reasons are basically that he has been in government for a very long time.  He has no more energy to continue.  He wants to rest so he is saying that he should make way for younger people to take over the reins of power.” Thabane has been under pressure to resign over a court case in which he and his current wife are suspects in the murder of his former wife, nearly three years ago.
