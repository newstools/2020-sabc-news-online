Eskom says it will be restricting electricity supply on a rotational basis in high density areas of the Gauteng province. The power utility says it will target areas, which are overloading and damaging infrastructure through illegal connections. The power utility says it has continued to record a “substantially high” trend of energy demand during peak periods in the mornings and evenings in certain areas of the province. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha insists that their decision to restrict electricity supply does not amount to load shedding. “So it is not load shedding. What we have here in Gauteng in particular and in other high density areas and this is the key word, high density areas which are also prone to people connecting to the electricity infrastructure illegally and overloading. This is an attempt therefore only during the peak hours that’s the evening and in the morning to limit supply to those areas,” explains Mantshantsha. In the video below, Mantshantsha explains how the power utility’s ‘electricity supply restriction’ will be implemented:  Eskom has not implemented load shedding since the national lockdown began on March 27. The stay-at-home order has seen a dramatic drop in demand for electricity.
