Parliament’s Police committee has given the Department of Police three months to appoint a permanent head for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). IPID briefed the committees virtually on various issues affecting the directorate. The directorate has been without a permanent head after the contract of Robert McBride was not renewed more than a year ago. The deadline for appointing a permanent Executive Director was at the end of February this year. Minister of Police Bheki Cele wrote to the Speaker of the National Assembly to ask for more time. Police  Committee Chairperson Tina Joemat-Petterson says this will be the last extension. “Since February given three months extension, prior to that advertised, re-advertised, it’s a long process. They said they were going to headhunt. We agree and give another three months, but let this really be the last three months,” says Joemat-Patterson.
