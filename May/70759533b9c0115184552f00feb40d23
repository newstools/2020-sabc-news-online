Government has received feminine hygiene products donated as part of the COVID-19 social relief measures. The handing over of the products is part of an initiative between the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities (DWYPD), United Nations (UN) and other stakeholders. It seeks to ensure that these products are made available to vulnerable women and girls during the lockdown period and beyond. The United Nations in Southern Africa expressed satisfaction with the manner in which the South African government is handling the COVID-19 pandemic. The UN Envoy to South Africa Nardos Bekele-Thomas says the world body is pleased with South Africa’s response programmes to the outbreak. “As the UN we are pleased with the level of government leadership in robust and comprehensive health and socio-economic programs undertaken. What is happening today is a continuation of our commitment in solidarity with the South African government and partners to ensure that gains made towards the achievement of sustainable development goals are not reversed.” Below is the link to the media briefing:  Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane handed over the donations to the Minister of Social Development, Ms Lindiwe Zulu in ensuring that these packs reach women and girls in shelters.
