The South African government is set to launch a procurement platform to service entire Africa, as the continent battles the coronavirus pandemic. There is a worldwide shortage of testing kits, curtailing efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the Chinese government has assisted in efforts to procure much-needed test kits for the continent. “We’ve been able to have great success just in the past few days of getting the suppliers in China with the intervention of President Xi Jinping, to agree that they will make available up to 30 million test kits for us on the African continent as well as 10 000 ventilators per month and 80 million marks per month for our continent.” President Ramaphosa was addressing Sanef via video link:  In April Microsoft founder and philanthropist, Bill Gates, committed to assisting African countries with mass-based testing kits for the coronavirus. Gates had talks with President Ramaphosa on Africa’s approach to the pandemic. South Africa has the highest number of cases on the continent. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus infections currently stands at 29 240 as of Friday night.
