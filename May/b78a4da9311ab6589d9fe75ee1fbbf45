Nineteen patients and 10 staff members have tested positive for Corona virus at the Life Esidimeni Frail Care Centre in Port Elizabeth.   The Eastern Cape Department of Health confirmed the outbreak of the virus at the facility which is situated in Lorraine. Eastern Cape health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo says the department and all relevant stakeholders are hard at work to ensure that the situation is under control. “We are taking all necessary steps to minimise the risk. I also wish to urge the people out there, the community, in general, to please take this virus issue seriously and comply with all the suggestions that have been made. People should wear their face masks, use hand sanitizers or wash your hand with soap for 20 seconds, practice good hygiene, and keep social distancing. The way we are aiding this virus is by moving up and down. The virus is not in buildings, the virus moves with humans from place to place. We have to play our roles as communities,”explains Kupelo. Meanwhile, as of Tuesday, South Africa recorded 43 more coronavirus related deaths, bringing the total to 524. There are currently 24 264 cases of coronavirus in the country. The Western Cape accounts for 65. 2% of the total number of cases. More than 600 000 tests have been conducted, 9 214 of which were done in the last 24 hours. The department says South Africa is currently facing a shortage of testing reagents. “We are, however, continuing our efforts to secure these reagents from different suppliers over the world.” Below is a breakdown of the stats:
