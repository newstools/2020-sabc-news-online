The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday reported 1 504 830 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 24 481 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 933 to 90 340. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus, as of 4 pm ET on May 18, compared with its count a day earlier. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Meanwhile, the CDC is planning a nationwide study of up to 325 000 people to track how the new coronavirus is spreading across the country into next year and beyond, a CDC spokesperson and researchers conducting the effort told Reuters. The CDC study, expected to launch in June or July, will test samples from blood donors in 25 metropolitan areas for antibodies created when the immune system fights the coronavirus, said Dr. Michael Busch, director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute. Busch is leading a preliminary version of the study – funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – that is testing the first 36 000 samples. The CDC-funded portion, to be formally announced this week, will expand the scope and time frame, taking samples over 18 months to see how antibodies evolve over time, said CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund.
