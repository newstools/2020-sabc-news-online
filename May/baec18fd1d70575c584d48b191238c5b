President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to host the inaugural Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium of South Africa (SIDSSA) in June. The symposium, which is a direct response to the decline in infrastructure spend in recent years, will focus on six priority sectors including water, transport, energy and digital infrastructure, human settlements and agriculture. In the lead up to the symposium, a market sounding exercise in the form of pitch sessions will be held on Thursday and Friday where project sponsors will engage national and international funding institutions, asset managers and commercial banks to present infrastructure projects that have been identified as potentially bankable and require project preparation funding.  So far the Investment and Infrastructure Office in the Presidency headed by Dr. Kgosientsho Ramokgopa has succeeded in drawing in sector specialists that have considered 177 infrastructure projects across public and private sectors which will be unpacked during these pitch sessions. In a statement the government said it recognises that infrastructure investment is a critical driver for the future growth of the South African economy and that the country requires a catalytic kind of infrastructure investment that will contribute to higher long-term growth, and address spatial disparities, transform the economy and create much needed jobs.
