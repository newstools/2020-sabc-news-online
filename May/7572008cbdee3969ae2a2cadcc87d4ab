The Free Market Foundation has slammed Police Minister Bheki Cele’s warning that people who are caught with a cigarette will need to provide proof of purchase – questioning whether Cele was serious when he made the comments. Foundation CEO, Leon Louw, says the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus has become a threat to individual freedoms. This comes as the country prepares to move to level three of the lockdown. Louw says South Africa is one of the few countries in the world that has banned cigarette and alcohol sales during the lockdown. He demanded Cele and others to read the constitution and the bill of rights. Also liquor associations have called on government to urgently reopen the manufacturing, distribution, and trade of alcohol during level three of lockdown. Most parts of the country are expected to move to Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown from the first of June, while areas with a high number of coronavirus infections might remain on a higher level.
