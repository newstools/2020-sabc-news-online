The case against a former Bryanston High School netball coach accused of sexual assault will resume at the Alexandra Magistrateâ€™s Court north of Johannesburg on Tuesday. The former coach had filed review representations to have his case removed from the court roll after he was arrested in January 2019 when a 17 year old pupil and her mother opened a criminal case against him. He was dismissed on March 1, 2019 after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of sexual harassment and financial mismanagement. Three other female pupils also came forward after the first allegations against the coach. It is alleged that he sexually assaulted the girls during netball matches and on school outings between 2017 and 2018. A decision by the Director of Public Prosecution is expected.
