Durban’s St Augustine’s and Kingsway hospitals will re-open on Sunday. Netcare has confirmed this in a statement. Both healthcare facilities were forced to close for new patient admissions last month after staff and patients tested positive for COVID-19. Doctors’ rooms at both hospitals will also open again. In a statement, regional director coastal for Netcare, Craig Murphy, says the re-opening comes under the advice of the provincial Health Department. St Augustine’s Hospital closed after 66 patients and healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19. This includes seven dialysis patients. At Kingsway, a patient who was admitted to hospital with a suspected stroke also tested positive for the virus. Murphy says last week both hospitals enhanced their disinfection and decontaminating programmes. South Africa has recorded eight new deaths as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose by 525 to 9 420.  In a statement, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says a total of 324 079 tests have so far been conducted countrywide.
