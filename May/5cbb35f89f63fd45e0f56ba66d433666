South Africa is moving to level 3 lockdown from June 1. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that alcohol will be sold for domestic consumption and on specified days. Tobacco sales remain prohibited. The President says exercise will be allowed and will no longer be restricted to specific times.  Group gatherings remain banned, except for funerals. However the number of mourners should not exceed 50.  The President has also confirmed that schools will reopen from next month. This as concerns remain over the risk this poses to learners.  Earlier, the Educators Union of South Africa (EUSA) called for schools to reopen in September as temperatures will be higher and therefore provide a better climate to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The union has served the Basic Education Department with legal papers, saying it intends to interdict the opening of schools. Grade 7 and 12 learners are set to return on the proposed date as announced by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Ramaphosa says 429 people have now died from coronavirus and that the number of infections now stands at 22 583. He says 128 people are in intensive care with COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus. The President says some areas will be declared coronavirus hotspots and will require special attention. All borders remain closed except for transportation of goods and repatriation of citizens. Ramaphosa’s full address is in the video below:
