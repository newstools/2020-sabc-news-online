South Africa has recorded 25 new COVID-19 deaths, pushing the number of fatalities to 577. The number of infections now stands at 27 403. The country has a 52,4% recovery rate, with 14 370 people having recuperated from the virus. In the last 24 hours 20 727 tests  have been conducted. This brings a total number of tests conducted to 655 723.  Earlier, President Cyril Ramaphosa said churches found violating the lockdown regulations under the alert Level-3 will be closed down. All places of worship will be allowed to operate from 1 June. Each gathering should consist of no more than 50 people and churches must adhere to other COVID-19 regulations, such as ensuring social distancing and sanitisation of congregants. President Ramaphosa added: “I am not as fearful as many of you are because I think this will be well managed. Many people have said trust the people of SA and leaders have said trust us so we are putting our trust in the people of SA and of course where we see that that trust is misplaced , government will act. For instance that some congregation goes beyond the numbers we have agreed,  we will act and we will close those places like other people wanted to open their taverns, we have closed them.”
