Another SABC employee based in the broadcaster’s head office in Auckland Park, Johannesburg has tested positive for the coronavirus. This is the second employee to test positive at the Auckland Park offices. Last week, the SABC’s offices in Cape Town had to be evacuated for deep cleaning after an employee tested positive while a journalist from the Northern Cape office in Kimberley was infected in March. Spokesperson Mmoni Seapolela says the Johannesburg employee is in self-isolation. “We can confirm that we have one confirmed case of COVID-19 at our Auckland Park office. As a precautionary measure all SABC protocols have been observed, including the employee being advised to quarantine. Other employees that have been in contact with the affected employee have been advised and will undergo testing for COVID-19.”
