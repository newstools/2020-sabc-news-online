Liberia‘s assistant mines minister said two miners had died in a mine collapse in western Liberia early on Tuesday, although a local mayor estimated scores more were likely killed based on the number of people missing. The collapse happened in a mining hub in Grand Cape Mount County, Assistant Mines Minister Emmanuel Swen told Reuters, adding that the ministry was in the process of gathering information on the incident. He put the death toll at two. But Edwin Koha, the mayor of the county’s administrative centre, told Reuters around 50 people were missing following the incident. He had earlier told state radio that 60 people had been killed. The mining industry of Liberia has witnessed a revival after the civil war which ended in 2003. Gold, diamonds, and iron ore form the core minerals of the mining sector with a new Mineral Development Policy and Mining Code being put in place to attract foreign investments. In 2013, the mineral sector accounted for 11% of GDP in the country and the World Bank has projected a further increase in the sector by 2017. Apart from iron ore extractions, cement, diamond, gold, and petroleum resources have also been given due importance to enrich the economy of the country. – Additional info from Wikipedia
