The Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC) and the World Health Organisation Africa Region (WHO-AFRO)  says people should allow for the Madagascan potion believed to cure COVID-19, to be put through scientific clinical trials. The island country says it has a herbal remedy that has assisted in the recoveries of patients who had contracted the viral infection. The Africa CDC and WHO-AFRO have both invited the Madagascan government to submit the potion for vaccine testing. In this video, Africa CDC discussed possibilities of testing Madagascar’s herbal remedy for COVID-19  Dr Matshidiso Moeti from WHO says there needs to be analysis if the herb is safe to use across populations before being shared widely. Moeti says the biggest concern with Madagascar’s herbal remedy is that it may give a false sense of security. On Wednesday, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize said that South Africa was willing to assist in the scientific research concerning the herbal remedy. Mkhize said that South Africa would only get involved in the scientific analysis of the herbal remedy.
