 Meanwhile, some of the shocked friends of the victims say they are trying to come to terms with the killings. “I am really not okay. It is hurting. I don’t know what they did … if they did something to those people. I was close to all of them. They were my friends, but the one I was close to is Nkanyiso Hlengwa.” Police say no arrests have been made so far and that investigations are continuing.
