The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has accused Comair of being insensitive towards its employees. Numsa claims Comair did not inform its workers that it was going into voluntary business rescue. The union says workers first heard about this through the media. Comair announced on Tuesday that it would enter into voluntary business rescue after reporting a half-year loss of R564-million following the grounding of aircraft due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola has described the developments as shocking. “For our members this is a particular shocking development because they heard about it first in the media. The CEO decided to communicate with the media first without informing the employees or informing Numsa as the only recognised trade union.” ”This announcement was made against the backdrop of the looming retrenchments after the airline served section 189 in March,” adds Hlubi-Majola. Aviation sector in need of govt support Aviation experts say the sector urgently needs government support to prevent more companies from going under after Comair announced that it would go into business rescue. The company was the latest  in South Africa following the lead of SA Express and South African Airways (SAA) entered into business rescue to safeguard the interests of the company. The airline says the decision comes as a result of the COVID-19 crisis which has disrupted the implementation of a turnaround plan. Independent transport economist Dr Joachim Vermooten says, “IATA indicated months ago no scheduled airline even though well capitalised will be able to sustain the financial impact of the grounding orders applied to airlines. It really required the government to come to the party and provide financial assistance otherwise the impact will be greatly felt in the country.
