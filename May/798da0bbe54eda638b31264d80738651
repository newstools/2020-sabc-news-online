Relatives of an Alexandra man, allegedly killed by soldiers, say they do not trust the South African National Defence Force‘s (SANDF) investigation into the murder. Collins Khosa died in an altercation with members of the SANDF and the Johannesburg Metro Police in April. His family has approached the High Court in Pretoria to apply for  an order to put an end to, what they call, lockdown brutality by the police and the army. The implicated SANDF and JMPD members are still on duty. The family’s legal representative, advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, has described the Defence Force’s probe as a sham. “The facts have not been denied and and therefore must be taken to be admitted. Secondly, their excuse about the investigation does not provide the cover not to answer the allegations. But we also know that there is no credibility into to this investigation. There can be no dispute that on the facts there has been a violation of rights that we pleaded on the founding affidavit. They could have gone to the police and asked them for their version.” Below is a video of Tuesday’s court proceedings into Khosa’s death:   In early April, police watchdog – the Independent Police Investigative Directorate  (IPID) – said it was investigating 38 cases against police officials across the country for misconduct during the first part of the country’s national lockdown. The investigations included two deaths in police custody in Limpopo, two deaths in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape.
