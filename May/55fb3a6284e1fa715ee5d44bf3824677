Nine security guards are expected to appear in the Krugersdorp Magistrates’ Court Tuesday morning on Gauteng’s West Rand. This is in connection with escape of 37 foreign nationals who were awaiting deportation at the Lindela Repatriation Centre. They’re accused of aiding the escapees after leaving their posts. They allegedly tipped off the deportees, who then scaled the walls. However, the guards maintain that they didn’t abandon their posts but left because they were not being paid overtime.  President of the Black Power Civil Rights Movement General Thekiso says they’ll stage a protest at court in support of their members. He says: “Seven of our members were charged with aiding to escape. The remaining two we made arrangements together with our legal team.” “They were handed over and charged with aiding to escape. So as the organisation we are going to be outside Krugersdorp Magistrates’ Court to support these members. We have mobilised all our branches.”
