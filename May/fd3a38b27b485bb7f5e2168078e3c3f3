Tributes are pouring in following the death of the Chairperson of the Council for Medical Schemes, Dr. Clarence Mini. Mini succumbed to COVID-19 complications on Monday night after being hospitalised for over a month. He worked for the Board of Healthcare Funders before former Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi appointed him to be the Chairperson of the council. The SABC Medical Scheme has reacted with shock to the news of his passing. The Principal Officer of the SABC Medical Aid Scheme, Anthony Williams, says Mini’s death brings the severity of the pandemic closer to home. “Despite his high profile, he always remained very close to the people and I think that is going to be his greatest legacy. The sad thing is that Dr Mini’s passing comes at a time when we as medical schemes and also the members of the medical schemes are able to deal with many issues due to this COVID-19. The Council for Medical Schemes under Dr Mini’s chairmanship has been very instrumental in providing its support and guidance to all of us in the medical aid industry especially as medical schemes.” In the video below, Council for Medical Scheme’s Grace Khoza pays tribute to Dr Mini:  Below is a statement on Mini’s death: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889431-STATEMENT-MINI.js", {

He was the co-chair of the first post-1994 National AIDS Convention of South Africa with Justice Edwin Cameron. Condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. https://t.co/DofxyEeu2P — ZackieAchmat(@ZackieAchmat) May 12, 2020  Health Minister Zweli Mkhize joined several other medical professionals who paid tribute to Mini. “We thank him for his contribution we salute him for his dedication to the course of freedom and democracy. We salute him for his dedication to ensure that we achieve the necessary health insurance and universal health care. Universal health coverage for all South Africans.” The African National Congress (ANC) has described Mini as a servant of the people who served with diligence in various capacities. “We pay homage to Dr. Mini for his outstanding role in the reconstruction and development of our country and convey our heartfelt condolences to his family, comrades, and friends. We dip our revolutionary banner in honour of our good Dr. Mini for his dedication and sacrifice in the fight for a free and just South Africa,” the governing party says in a statement. The ANC in Gauteng says it remembers Dr. Mini as the most disciplined and unassuming Branch leader in the Joburg suburbs. “On his return to the country, Dr. Mini remained a loyal and disciplined member of the African National Congress subjecting himself to the basic unit of the organization regardless of his statue and standing in society.” Born in 1951, Dr. Mini affectionately known amongst his generation as “Comrade Boy” was a member of UMkhonto We Sizwe (MK) June 16 Detachment, having trained in Angola. He studied Medicine in Bulgaria. “Like Commandante Dr. Ernesto “Che” Guevera, comrade Boy Mini was an MK guerrilla that also qualified as a Medical Doctor to be able to look after the health of his comrades whenever the need arose. We will forever cherish his passion and commitment towards transforming the health care industry. Our nation will treasure his memory as one of its most distinguished servants who consciously chose to serve selflessly. Even up to his last Dr. Mini remained in the service of his people,” reads the ANC statement. – Additional reporting by Thabile Mbhele
