The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has apologised to its beneficiaries for a number of technical issues in the system that affected social grant payments on Monday. Sassa claims that it made accidental double payments in some provinces and no payments in others as it tried to process early payments to avoid overcrowding.  Spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi says the payment issues have been resolved. “We profusely apologise for those mishaps. We also want to appeal to our beneficiaries that they must use whatever platform available to access their grants. A beneficiary can access their grant at any machine, the Post Office or bank of their choice. We are also trying to make sure that we minimise the movement of cash as much as possible because in some instances old people get their money and when they leave they get robbed. This card they are using, they can use it to buy whatever they want from the shops without using cash.”  Rollout of cashless ATMs The South African Post Office says it will continue rolling out cashless ATMs across the country to assist with grant payments. The cashless ATMs are aimed at easing congestion and promoting social distancing during payments. Customers will be able to use them to purchase pre-paid electricity, airtime as well as pay municipal and other bills. The first cashless ATMs were rolled out in Tlhabane near Rustenburg in the North West on Monday:  In a bid to counter the coronavirus pandemic, government has committed to scaling up welfare provisions and food support to assist the most vulnerable. This also includes the increase of child support grants and other grants:  -Additional reporting by Zebilon Maine
