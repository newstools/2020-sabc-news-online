Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane has called on commercial banks to play their part in preventing the spread of the coronavirus by providing sanitisers at all ATMs. He made the call while visiting a shopping mall in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, to check on social grant payments. Mabuyane says he was surprised that not a single ATM belonging to four banks was sanitised. “Seeing people sharing ATMs without being sanitised is a serious risk. I want call on banks to play their part … even if it means leaving a bottle of a sanitiser with a security officer, at least there must be someone responsible,” adds Mabuyane.

The province recorded its first case on March 21 after a patient who had traveled to Germany tested positive. To date, in just over a month, the province has now confirmed 838 cases, with 18 deaths and 341 recoveries.
