The chief executive of Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of the experimental coronavirus drug Remdesivir, said on Friday he expected the Food and Drug Administration to act quickly over the company’s application for approval. It would try to get the drug to as many people as possible if it was approved, Daniel O’Day said. “We’re moving very quickly with the FDA,” O’Day said in an interview with NBC’s Today show. “And I expect that they’re going to act very quickly.”  Bogus cures for COVID-19 In March, British authorities said they were clamping down on bogus cures for the coronavirus, which currently has no specific licensed treatment. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was investigating 14 fake or unlicensed products to treat COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. “There is no medicine licensed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore any claiming to do so are not authorised and have not undergone regulatory approvals required for sale on the UK market.” Scammell added that MHRA was working alongside law enforcement agencies to combat the spread of fake and unlicensed medical products. Protective measures Governments across the world continue urging people to continue following precautionary measures.
