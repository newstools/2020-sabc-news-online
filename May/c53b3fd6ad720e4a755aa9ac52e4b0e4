The City of Cape Town has tabled a R3 billion social package to support the indigent, disabled and pensioners aimed at offering financial relief during COVID-19. Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato tabled the City’s R54 billion budget before the council. Plato says a range of interest-free payment options are also available for struggling residents who have fallen behind on their rates. “If your property value is below R300 000, or household income is below R4500, you will get no less than a 100% property, refuse rebate and 10.5 kilolitres of free water. We know that many have already lost their jobs or fallen on hard times. That’s why we are raising the indigent threshold to R7000 income per month and increasing the rates discount for many in this category,” explains Plato. Meanwhile, South Africa has recorded 28 new COVID-19 deaths, pushing the number of fatalities to 552. The number of infections now stands at 25 937. The country has a 52% recovery rate, with 13 451 people having recuperated from the virus.
