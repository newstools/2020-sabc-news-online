Licence centres for motor vehicle, driver’s or learner’s licences will reopen from June 1. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula visited the Tshwane Licencing Centre in Centurion on Friday to inspect the facilities readiness to safely accommodate clients from June 1. Clearly marked social distancing stickers and hand sanitisers are everywhere. Mbalula says if the centres do not adhere to the regulations they will be shut down. He says, “Driving licence testing centres, registering authorities, vehicle testing stations and driving schools will resume their services with effect from 1 June 2020. No person is allowed to enter centres, registering authorities, vehicle testing stations and driving schools if they do not wear a cloth facemask.” Earlier, Mbalula launched a computerised learner testing system at the centre. He  says the system will assist in dealing with the backlog accumulated during the nationwide lockdown. Briefing the media, Mbalula said the centre will be open from June along with driving schools with strict hygiene protocols. All licences that expired since the commencement of the nationwide lockdown have been extended for a further 90 days.
