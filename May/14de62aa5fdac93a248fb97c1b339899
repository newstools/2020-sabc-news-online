Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says Metrorail will only start operating once the country moves to Level-3 of the national lockdown. South Africa is now on Level-4, where certain services, including some companies, are allowed to operate. The Gautrain is operating with social distancing seating arrangements in place and testing with an e-health scanner being done at the Hatfield station. This process may be rolled out to the whole service once it proves to be effective.
