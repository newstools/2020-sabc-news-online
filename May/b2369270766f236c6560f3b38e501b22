The police officer who allegedly killed George Floyd by placing a knee on his neck has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder. “He is in custody and has been charged with murder,” Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, said of Derek Chauvin, who is White. The arrest comes after three nights of violent protests in the Midwestern city sparked by the death.  “We have evidence, we have the citizen’s video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we’ve seen over and over again.” Freeman said a detailed complaint would be made available later on Friday. The cellphone footage showed Floyd repeatedly moaning and gasping while he pleaded to Chauvin, kneeling on his neck,”Please, I can’t breathe.” After several minutes, Floyd gradually grows quiet and ceases to move. Earlier on Friday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called for an end to the violent protests that have rocked Minneapolis and said the state’s National Guard would work to restore order following three nights of arson, looting and vandalism.
