Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde, has presented the province’s strategy to a virtual meeting of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Co-ordinating Council. The strategy focuses on areas in each of the City of Cape Town’s eight sub-districts, and in Witzenberg which account for a large proportion of the infections in the Western Cape, which is the highest in the country.  Ministers, premiers of all the nine provinces, as well as representatives of the South African Local Government Association attended the meeting. The focus of discussions was the response to COVID-19 across the provinces, and the move towards Level 3 of the lockdown. The National Command Council will now discuss the various submissions at their meeting. Concern over Western Cape Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize this week expressed concern over the clusters of coronavirus infections in the Western Cape. The province has 9 246  cases and 156 deaths. Mkhize says South Africans must continue to adhere to the lockdown regulations, especially those of social distancing, good hand hygiene and wearing a mask when leaving your home.
