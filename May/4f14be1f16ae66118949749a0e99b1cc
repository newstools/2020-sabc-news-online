Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has joined 87 other Nobel Peace Laureates and world leaders to call on governments around the world to prioritise children in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic – or risk losing an entire generation. The Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation says, in a statement, that the coronavirus has exposed and worsened global inequalities and children are among those worst affected. The Foundation says children, often in poor areas, face various forms of exploitation  – including sexual. It has urged the world’s leaders to ensure that a fair share of resources to battle COVID-19 – are directed at assisting marginalised children – and that the results of such an endeavor could transform the world. Earlier on Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa called for global solidarity to fight the coronavirus crisis. Ramaphosa was addressing the 73rd Session of the World Health Assembly, which is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organisation (WHO). The virtual session was being attended by representatives of the United Nation’s over 190 member states. Ramaphosa says the coronavirus outbreak is a clear call for the urgent implementation of universal healthcare. In the video below, Ramaphosa addresses the virtual 73rd World Health Assembly:  Various other world leaders also addressed the Assembly, calling for unity and collaboration in the fight against the pandemic that has infected over 4 million people worldwide.    The United Nations Secretary General paid homage to millions of people who put their lives at risk to save lives.
