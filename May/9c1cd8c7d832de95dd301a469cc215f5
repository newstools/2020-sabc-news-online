Tripoli’s Mitiga airport sustained heavy damages on Sunday, a day after shelling hit fuel tanks and damaged passenger planes and departure halls. The Transport Ministry, blaming eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar, said one of the damaged planes was preparing to fly to Spain to retrieve Libyans stranded in Europe by the coronavirus lockdown.  Mitiga is the last functioning airport in the Libyan capital, though civilian flights stopped in March because of repeated shelling even before the country imposed a lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic. LNA spokesman, Ahmed al-Mismari, has not officially commented on Saturday’s shelling at Mitiga. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) has been fighting for more than a year to capture Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), with frequent shelling of the capital.
