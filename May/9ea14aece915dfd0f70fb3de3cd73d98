The memorial service of  the Chairperson of the Council for Medical Schemes, Dr. Clarence Mini is underway. Mini succumbed to COVID-19 complications on Monday night after being hospitalised for over a month. He previously worked for the Board of Healthcare Funders before former Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi appointed him to be the Chairperson of the council.  Reacting to the passing of Dr Mini, Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says there would be massive loss of lives in South Africa if COVID-19 is not managed well. Motsoaledi says the country has lost a principled leader who was committed to making the National Health Insurance a success. “His death is a terrible terrible terrible loss to the healthcare profession also to the struggle for liberation as a whole. He was a gentle giant who used to do his work with diligence. He never changed his principles especially towards NHI, he kept on supporting it and he was always very cool calculating and very systematic in his work. It just shows what a terrible loss we can experience in a country if we don’t control COVID-19.” For more news visit sabcnews.com
