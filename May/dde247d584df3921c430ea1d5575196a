President Cyril Ramaphosa has applauded all citizens who have adhered to all regulations since the commencement of the nation wide lockdown. The country has been on level 5 nationwide lockdown since March 27 to May 1st. The lockdown has since been eased from level 5 to level 4. “This has been possible because most South Africans have adhered to the lockdown provisions, practising social distancing, and wearing face masks. I applaud you for this and for all the other sacrifices you have made.” This means that under level 4 some activity can be allowed to resume, subject to extreme precautions required to limit community transmission and outbreaks. In his weekly newsletter, the President has used the opportunity to respond to criticism leveled against him over his turn-about on the ban of cigarette sale. “After careful consideration and discussion, the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) reconsidered its position on tobacco. As a result, the regulations ratified by Cabinet and announced by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on 29 April extended the prohibition,” adds the President. Ramaphosa has once again urged South Africans to continue adhering to the lockdown regulations. The President says lockdown has been effective thus far. “Those measures, which included a nation-wide lockdown and the closure of our borders have proved to be effective in delaying the spread of the disease.”  He says 6 783 cases have been recorded, with 2 549 recoveries. Active cases have risen by 489 bringing the total number up to 4 103. South Africa’s infection rate is just 217 new infections shy of reaching 7 000. The increase in deaths is recorded from the Eastern Cape with 4 and both Gauteng and Western Cape recording 2 each. The video below, is reporting about an increase of  SA COVID-19 cases
