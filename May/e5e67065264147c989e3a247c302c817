China reported 2 new coronavirus cases for May 5 and 20 new asymptomatic cases, data from the national health authority showed on Wednesday. This compared with 1 new coronavirus case and 15 new asymptomatic cases reported a day earlier. The two new cases were so-called imported cases involving travellers from overseas, compared with one such case a day earlier. China’s total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 82 883, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4 633, the National Health Commission said in a statement. Meanwhile, Chinese tourists made a total of 115 million trips during the Labour Day holiday from May 1-5 as coronavirus restrictions were eased, but the total was still down 41% from 195 million a year earlier, the China Daily newspaper said, citing data from the culture and tourism ministry. Total revenues for travel operators over the period hit 47.56 billion yuan ($6.74 billion), it said, but it didn’t give a comparative figure for last year.
China has tried to encourage domestic tourism in a bid to revive its economy, which has been hit by months of coronaviruslockdowns. The number of people travelling outside their cities surged nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day holiday, compared with the Tomb Sweeping holiday on April 4, according to Reuterscalculations based on data from China’s internet giant Baidu.
