US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he may support another fiscal stimulus bill to help prop up the economy during the coronavirus outbreak, though he did not provide any details on what he would like to see in such legislation. “I think we will. I think we’re going to be helping people out … There could be one more nice shot,” Trump told reporters at a Ford factory in Michigan. Trump toured the Ford plant, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment, and held a round table discussion with African-American leaders concerning vulnerable populations hit by the virus. The President, who has said he is taking a drug not proven for the coronavirus after two White House staffers tested positive in recent weeks, did not wear a mask during any of his public events at the plant in the city of Ypsilanti even though Ford on Tuesday reiterated its policy that all visitors must wear them. Trump has consistently disregarded guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging people to wear masks in close company to try to curb the spread of the virus. Surrounded by Ford executives who were wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras, “I had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,” Trump said. When asked if Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said, “It’s up to him.” “Honestly I think I look better in a mask,” Trump added jokingly. Trump, a Republican seeking re-election on November 3, has urged states to loosen coronavirus-related restrictions so the battered US economy can recover even as public health experts warn that premature relaxation of restrictions could lead to a second wave of infections.
