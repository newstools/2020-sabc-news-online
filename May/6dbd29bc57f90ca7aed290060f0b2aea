The Northern Cape Health Department says it continues to prepare COVID-19 quarantine sites, despite the relatively low number of infections in the province. The province has the lowest number of people who have tested positive, at 29 with no deaths reported. The Health Department says there is at least one quarantine facility in each of the province’s five districts. The Northern Cape has seen the least number of cases of COVID-19 in the country. However, the provincial Health Department warns that this is just the beginning with more cases expected over the coming months. The department believes it has adequately prepared for this. Provincial Health MEC Mase Manopole says there are 1360 beds available in quarantine sites across the province. “Only two districts have active cases which are Frances Baard and ZFM. In health, we are in Stage 5 where we are doing vigorous surveillance, hotspot identification and are doing screening and testing. We are preparing and prepared already in case if we get to a certain area and we have to admit 20 to 50 people. Our facilities are ready,” says Manopole.

One Kimberley man, who prefers to remain anonymous, says his life was put in danger after fake news spread that he had caught the virus. “That resulted in mob justice being formed against us by the community. My family is still traumatised. People must not spread fake news.” Meanwhile, a family of 11 people has been put in quarantine and is awaiting test results after one of their members tested positive for the virus.
