We advise that during this period, they must also not change their sim-cards so as to enable network operators, through their institutions, to load data to their devices. Don’t use this data for wrong things.” Below is Nzimande’s full address:  In the video below, students react to Nzimande’s address:  Below is Minister Nzimande’s full statement:
