The Department of Water and Sanitation says it has identified over 2 000 communities across the country in urgent need of water supply and access to sanitation. Minister of Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu says the department has so far delivered close to 20 000 water tanks across the country since the start of the national coronavirus lockdown.  Sisulu says they are still in the process of de-densifying some communities mainly in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, and Eastern Cape to try and slow the spread of the coronavirus. “We have been in consultation over a long period of time with some NGOs who work for these communities. We have reached a point where we have started in one or two communities which we will showcase in the week making sure that we are able to turnaround the lives of the people,” says Sisulu.
