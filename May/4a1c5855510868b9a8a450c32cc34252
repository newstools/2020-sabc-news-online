The George Council, in the Southern Cape, has elected a new mayor in a virtual council meeting. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed Leon van Wyk’s election. The move follows the suspension of former mayor, Melvin Naik, earlier this year due alleged involvement in corrupt activities. DA George Constituency Head, Geordin Hill-Lewis, says Van Wyk’s election is the first step towards restoring the integrity of the George council. “Leon brings with him the integrity, energy and humility needed for this job. He will take the lead on attracting investments, growing the local economy and keeping George as one of the best places to live in South Africa.  We wish him well and congratulate him and the entire team there and we’re very excited for the things he’ll do in George.”  DA cancels  Naik’s membership In February, the DA Federal Legal Commission informed Naik that his membership was cancelled. He was given 48 hours to resign as  George Mayor but he refused to do. The party’s action came after the DA caucus in George passed a motion of no confidence in Naik in January. This after a forensic investigation found evidence of Naik’s involvement in fraud, corruption, maladministration and serious malpractice within the municipality.
