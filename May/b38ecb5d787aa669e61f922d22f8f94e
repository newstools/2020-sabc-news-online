It says that Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga was reckless when she announced the reopening of schools. In this video, teacher unions discuss the reopening of schools  SANCO says this will cause more deaths as the country is not yet ready to reopen schools. SANCO Deputy President, Lemias Mashile, has called on student organisations, parents and other civil organisations to reject the reopening of schools. “We believe that we cannot gamble and experiment with our children as this will put kids under danger. Educators and families. The department and the country are simply not prepared if we consider the realities of class sizes. Disinfections and proper toilets facilities, social distancing, screening and soap,” says Mashile.
