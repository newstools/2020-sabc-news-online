It will be irresponsible. We want to reiterate that we support the gradual easing down as advised by medical experts and scientists. We are very  disturbed by the call of the DA for the president to suspend the lockdown. We believe it is irresponsible and opportunistic from them. They don’t have respect for the lives of the people and putting the economy above the lives of people. We are saying there must be a balance between saving lives and the economy.” The ANC, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) have also thrown their weight behind government’s decision for a continued lockdown. They say while they understand the economic devastation COVID-19 poses, the lives and health of South Africans should be the top priority.
