WHO recommendations on easing lockdown restrictions As countries in Europe and areas of the US start to lift their lockdowns, the World Health Organisation has released criteria for lifting lockdowns.  Mkhize has thanked South Africans for their tenacity and cooperation with government in the fight against COVID-19. He says that he knows that citizens are eager to return to normalcy, albeit a new normal. He says that the country has succeeded in flattening the curve, “which facilitated ramping up and cohesion of our health care system as well as preparation of our spaces as we resume our economic and social development.” “A few examples are that we have screened 10 737 341 citizens. We now have 376 sites identified for quarantine nationally with 30 823 quarantine beds. Significantly, our mortality rate, 1.8%, remains well below the global average which is currently 6.6% and our recovery rate is 42.4%, above the global average of 38%,” the Minister said in a statement. The minister says that government is consulting with various stakeholders on the easing of lockdown. He says this process is guided by the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommendations, which are as follows: “The risk of returning to lockdown remains very real if countries do not manage the transition extremely carefully and in a phased approach,” Director General of WHO, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said.
