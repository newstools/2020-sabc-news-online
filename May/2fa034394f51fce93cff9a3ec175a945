People who are working remotely are at risk of falling victim to cyber-attacks. Most of them are using their insecure personal devices and are not able to fend off cyber-attacks. Cyber security experts put the blame on companies for not training their employees on cyber security. According to a forensic expert, Mario Fazekas, many people working from home are not vigilant against cyber-attacks. He says security around their personal devices is not a priority and this exposes them to criminals. “What we found some of the threats is that people working at home they got routers and modems but many of them have default passwords so it is easy for criminals to go online look at the manufacturers who publish the default login details and then go and try in the neighbourhoods and then they get into their systems. They also using their own devices which have less security than the one issued by the company. So the companies are trying to save money by telling people bring your own device (BYOD) but security is not so good.” In the video below, CEO at AVeS Cyber Security, Charl Ueckermann, talks about the cyber risks associated with working from home.
