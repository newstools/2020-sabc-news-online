Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says at least 200 South Africans who are stranded in India are expected to be repatriated from 22 May, pending COVID-19 testing. The South Africans claim that they were unable to make travel arrangements due to the emergency lockdown imposed in India and have been stranded since March. Media Liaison for Dirco, Lunga Ngqengelele, says the delay in the repatriation was as a result of the high number of South Africans stranded across the world. “As part of the efforts by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, working with our missions abroad, we have been assisting with the repatriation of many South African who found themselves stranded abroad. We will be able to repatriate some of our South African citizens who were stuck in India as from the 22nd of this month. So it is part of the efforts that we have been putting as the department. ) Early in May the Department of International Relations organised flights departing Washington DC for South Africa, repatriating some 275 citizens who were stuck in the United States since the coronavirus restrictions were implemented Flights to repatriate South Africans from USA:  This was one of three flights that returned citizens to the country this month. Among those passengers were citizens who were working in hospitality, particularly resorts or country clubs in the United States. Some were on holiday, other passengers on cruises that are no longer operating due to COVID-19 restrictions. Passengers will be expected to enter  a two-week quarantine upon arrival in South Africa.
