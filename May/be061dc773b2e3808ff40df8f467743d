The High Court in Pretoria has ruled that all members of the South African National Defence Force  (SANDF) who were present when 40-year-old resident of Alexandra in Johannesburg Collins Khosa was assaulted to death should be suspended. The incident happened last month over the Easter weekend. Khosa’s family had earlier approached the Constitutional Court which dismissed the case because of insufficient evidence. The family then approached the High Court to lodge an urgent application to force the government to intervene and reign in law enforcement’s heavy-handedness during the lockdown. Since the start of the national lockdown there have been reports of SANDF and police using excessive force. Last month, Police Minister, Bheki Cele, said his department investigated 26 cases related to police brutality across the country. In Soweto, Ekurhuleni and Alexandra there have been fatalities allegedly connected to the police or SANDF.
