Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to his Downing Street residence on Sunday after recovering from COVID-19, ready to take the helm again with pressure growing for the government to explain how it will ease a month-old coronavirus lockdown. Johnson, 55, spent three nights in intensive care with the illness. A spokesperson confirmed he was back at 10 Downing Street on Sunday evening after two weeks recovering at Chequers, his country residence. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson back to work: He will resume full-time work on Monday and is “raring to go”, his stand-in Dominic Raab said. On his desk, Johnson will find a letter from opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer urging him to set out when and how an economic and social lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus might be eased, one of many demanding more information. Raab, the foreign secretary, said speculation about this risked diluting the message that people should stay at home. “We are at a delicate and dangerous stage and we need to make sure that the next steps are sure-footed,” he told Sky News. The official number of deaths related to COVID-19 in hospitals across the United Kingdom rose to 20,732, up by 413 in 24 hours, while confirmed cases stood at 152,840, up by 4,463. Deaths in the community and in nursing homes are slower to arrive, meaning that the overall toll is likely to be significantly higher. Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service in England, said the “very definite” downward trend in the number of coronavirus cases in hospital demonstrated that social distancing was reducing virus transmission and spread.
