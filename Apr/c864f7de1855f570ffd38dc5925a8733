The Chris Hani Region of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has welcomed the resignation of Madoda Papiyana. Papiyana is both the regional treasurer and Chief Whip at the Chris Hani District Municipality. He transgressed the national lockdown regulations by fleeing from a roadblock in Elliot. He was arrested in Engcobo and found to be under the influence of alcohol and also had alcohol in his car. The ANC’s Chris Hani Regional secretary, Lusanda Sizani, says the ANC appreciates Papiyana’s decision to resign following his breach of the lockdown regulations. “We believe that as the African National Congress we must protect the integrity, also we must make sure that the community understands what is happening. So that is why we are happy with the decision of his resignation as a Chief Whip. What we heard from the police that when they requested for the permit and comrade Papiyana gave them the permit, while the police were looking into the permit, the validity and whatnot, Papiyana drove his car and ran away from the police.” In the video below police battle illegal alcohol trade under COVID-19 lockdown:  Lockdown regulations The South African government lockdown regulations stipulate a ban on the sale of alcohol and cigarettes. The reasoning for the cigarette ban is largely health-related, citing the weakening of the immune system and a greater propensity for lung-related impairments as a result of smoking. During this lockdown period, some analysts have noted that the price of cigarettes on the black market have already gone up three times the usual price. This shows that the demand is still being supplied. In the video, Police arrest law breakers breaching the lockdown rules:  The graphic below shows the amended regulations of the lockdown rules:
