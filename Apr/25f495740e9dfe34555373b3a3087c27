The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo has placed two councillors on temporary suspension for alleged violation of lockdown regulations. Councillor Jack Legodi of the Polokwane local municipality and councillor Tebego Mamorobela of Makhado local municipality were arrested last week for separately hosting parties during the lockdown.  ANC provincial spokesperson Donald Selamolela says the suspension of the two councillors does not in any way pronounce on their guilt or innocence. “This is a temporary suspension pending the disciplinary process. We must reiterate the fact that this process doesn’t in any how suggest that the comrades are either innocent or guilty. This is a process to ensure that we endeavour to protect the integrity of the organisation.” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa placed Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams on a special two-month leave, one of which will be unpaid, for violating the rules.
