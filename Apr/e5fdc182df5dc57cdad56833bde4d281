We don’t want to conclude, we are looking and still observing what happened and we have said that let there be further investigation on the matter.” Provincial Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu says they are closely monitoring investigations into the hospital. “I did not say there was a trend of private facilities not following protocols, but I did say in this hospital in particularly, the investigation so far has indicated that there might have been that challenge. That is why we have decided that we will continue and then have an in-depth investigation in relation to that. We are able to understand what actually happened and what has let this particular facility to have a such number of infections and such a number of deaths. So, once we received a proper investigation, as the Department of Health, we are going to go through the proper legal channels and speak to them and follow them if there is anyone who should be held accountable, but we don’t want to jump processes.” KwaZulu-Natal has the highest number of deaths due to coronavirus.
