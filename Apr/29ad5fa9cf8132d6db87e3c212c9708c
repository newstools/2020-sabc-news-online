National Police Spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo says the Hermanus Police Station in the Overberg has been closed for 48 hours. This after a police officer at the station tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). This is the second police officer in the Western Cape to contract the virus. The first reported case was of a police officer at the Athlone police station.  The Hermanus Police Station is in the process of being decontaminated. Naidoo says community service operations have not been affected. “The building is currently in the process of decontamination, but the community service centre has been moved to a location opposite the police station to continue with services delivery. Measures have been put in place to ensure that operational duties are not comprised.” In the video below, Hermanus residents are urged to come out only for essentials during the nationwide lockdown.  Looting during the lockdown Several people have been arrested for allegedly looting liquor stores in the Western Cape. A video went viral showing people breaking into a store in Avonwood Mall in Elsies River. Police say people are believed to have gained entry by forcefully opening a door and then stealing bottles of alcohol. Police Spokesperson Novela Potelwa says liquor store looting was also reported in Retreat, Hermanus and Mbekweni in Paarl. She says tracing operations were launched to search for the perpetrators. “As a consequence, six youths have been arrested in Mbekweni for burglary and theft. Seven suspects between the ages of 18 and 33 were arrested in Elsies River.” Meanwhile, a 30-year-old woman was arrested in Retreat and two suspects in their late 20s were arrested in Hermanus. The police in the Western Cape are issuing a stern warning to those who carry out these acts that they will be dealt with decisively. The arrested suspects are expected to appear in various courts soon.
