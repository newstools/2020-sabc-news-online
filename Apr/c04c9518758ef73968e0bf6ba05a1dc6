Informal traders attempting to renew their operating permits at the Florida Civic Centre, West of Johannesburg, say they have been waiting in line for more than five hours on Tuesday morning. More than 100 traders, mostly tuckshop owners, are still standing in long queues as officials are allowing only a few people into the building at a time. Tuesday is the last day they can obtain the permit. “I have been here for 5 hours now, just waiting to renew my permit for selling in my spaza shop in Zandspruit Honeydew. The queue is not going well. I don’t know if they will finish serving us today,” says a frustrated informal trader.   Phase two of issuing permits Last week, the Department of Economic Development in the City of Johannesburg announced phase two of the issuing of temporary permits for informal traders. The department last month took a decision to suspend the issuing of permits after a large crowd descended on its offices in the Johannesburg CBD, compromising the safety and social distancing lockdown regulations. The City of Johannesburg has called on informal traders to bring their necessary supporting documents when applying for permits. “The issuing of permits for informal traders will be managed from the city’s opportunity centres across the seven regions and the Joburg Market. The issuing of spaza shops permits will be coordinated from all seven regional opportunities centres,” said member of the Mayoral Committee for Economic Development in the City of Joburg, Lloyd Phillips. “Phase two implementation dates are from 22 April to 28 April 2020. All informal traders including spaza shops must ensure that they meet necessary qualifying criteria,” added Phillips.
