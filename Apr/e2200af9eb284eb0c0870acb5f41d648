The Ombudsman for long term insurance has cautioned policy holders about non-payment of premiums during the nationwide lockdown. The Ombudsman’s office was commenting due to the impact of the lockdown on people’s health, employment and finances. It says consumers must ensure the premium payments are up to date to ensure the policy stays in force.  Long term insurance deputy Ombudsman, Jennifer Price says it’s important to contact your insurer if you can’t pay your premiums. “Particularly at this time it is important that policies don’t lapse. There are some insurers who are giving relief to people in this time of coronavirus, but one can’t make that assumption, you have to contact your insurer and make sure that if you can’t pay the premiums that there is some relief offered to you. We are open during this time and the service is free so if people aren’t sure what to do in regards to their policies then they’re certainly welcome to phone us.” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a R500 billion economic response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The announcement was made on Day 26 of a national lockdown that is expected to continue until the end of April. The lockdown has imposed restrictions that have left many people in the country financially strained. “The pandemic requires an economic response that is equal to the scale of the disruption it is causing,” said  Ramaphosa. R500 billion amounts to 10% of South Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The stimulus package is divided into three phases, with the recent R500 billion announcement being the second phase.
