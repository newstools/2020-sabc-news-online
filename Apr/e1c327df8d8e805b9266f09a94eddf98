The High Court in Cape Town has ruled that the evictions of informal dwellers at Empolweni informal settlement in Khayelitsha was unlawful. This after over a hundred dwellers were evicted from the settlement over the Easter weekend.   The court ruled that the City of Cape Town must return all the building material of the dwellers by midday on Monday. The residents, who were represented by the Legal Resources Centre, will now be allowed to return to the land and re-erect their dwellings.   Criticism of Empolweni evictions: The City of Cape Townâ€™s anti land invasion unit and law enforcement agencies came under widespread criticism following the evictions. On Sunday, residents whose illegal structures had earlier been demolished pelted the vehicle of a mayoral committee member, Malusi Booi. Booi escaped without injury but his vehicle was damaged in the incident. Below, Booi speaks to SABC News via Skype about the evictions.   Booi says plans to redevelop the land will now have to grind to a halt.
