Social users have also expressed their heartfelt condolences to the Goldberg family, with some sharing their fondest memories with the struggle stalwart.     The African National Congress (ANC) says it’s deeply saddened by the passing of one of the party’ stalwarts of the struggle for liberation, Denis Goldberg. In a statement, the party said Goldberg belonged to that illustrious generation of freedom fighters, who were prepared to sacrifice all and lay down their lives in the struggle for liberation. It sent its condolences to Goldberg family, his friends and comrades.        The Nelson Mandela Foundation says South Africa has lost another true patriot, someone who was a friend of Nelson Mandela and a stalwart of struggle. “Most of Ntate Goldberg’s life was dedicated to the struggle against apartheid and the building of democracy. He was a member of a generation of leadership which shaped the country’s history in profound ways. In later years he challenged the direction our democracy was taking, initially critiquing the country’s macroeconomic policies and then challenging state capture during the years of cronyism and looting. “We at the Foundation got to know him through his close contact with Madiba and through his participation in our projects.” “He was our friend,” Chief Executive Sello Hatang reflects.
