Small Business Development Minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says government is finalising the support scheme for informal traders and spaza shops.  Addressing the media in Pretoria on Tuesday, Ntshavheni says the support will come in the  form of bulk buying arrangements, access to seed capital and business management training.  Government will also facilitate the licensing of spaza shops.  She says more details about the support scheme will be announced later this week. “We are also going to assist spaza shops those without banks accounts to access bank accounts … the spaza shop owner must be willing to register on the CIPC and UIF.”  ”They must give us proof of banking, they must register in SMME SA. We are going to communicate that when we communicate the date for opening,” explains the minister.  Inter-ministerial committee media briefing on COVID-19
