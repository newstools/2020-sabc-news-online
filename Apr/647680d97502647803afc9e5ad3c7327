Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga says that she is horrified at the number of schools that have been vandalised and damaged since the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) began. On Sunday night, three schools were broken into and learning equipment stolen in KwaZulu-Natal.   A total of 183 schools have been vandalised around the country. Mpumalanga has had the most school vandalism incidents with 72 cases, followed by Gauteng with 55. North West has had seven cases of school vandalism. In the video below, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says they have launched an investigation into the burning of schools in the province.   Motshekga said in a statement that she is working with Police Minister Bheki Cele to get to the bottom of these incidents. “It is quite disheartening that criminal elements in our communities could destroy the infrastructure of their own children with such apparent impunity. I am in constant touch with the Minister of Police and with the assistance of the State Intelligence Forces, we are following leads to the immediate arrest and prosecution of every single criminal responsible.” She has urged community members to help the police identify the culprits. “These criminals must be reported to the police immediately. Let us work together to safeguard the future of our children by exposing these criminal elements.” Learners from the affected schools could possibly experience delays once schools reopen and the implementation of the curriculum get underway. In the video below, the lack of security is blamed for the torching of schools during the lockdown.
