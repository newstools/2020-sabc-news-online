 Visits to Gauteng hospitals not allowed during lockdown The Gauteng Health Department has again reminded the public that no hospital visits are allowed for the duration of the lockdown. It says only emergencies, surgical out-patients, pregnant women and medical out-patients who are booked to collect their medication will be allowed at hospitals. The department is concerned that community members continue to visit in numbers at public hospitals to see their loved ones. The department’s spokesperson is Kwara Kekana says, “We wish to inform the public that visiting times as of Thursday, 26 March 2020, have been cancelled at all Gauteng public hospitals for the duration of lockdown period.” “Everyone will be expected to be sanitised when entering our premises and everyone will be screened for COVID-19. Depending on the outcomes of the screening, patients will be directed accordingly to triage points set up in our facilities. Lastly, anyone with respiratory symptoms will be provided with a mask.” Kekana adds. In the video below, teams countrywide are tracing COVID-19 contacts:
