He raised concerns around dealing with coronavirus with the challenge of comorbidities such as Tuberculosis, HIV, obesity and hypertension is the biggest challenge faced by government and health officials. “A huge number of our people are having diabetes, hypertension, chest infections, TB, HIV and Aids and cancers. All of these need to be managed as well, whilst we are dealing with this.
