Tiger Brands have confirmed that twelve of their employees tested positive for COVID-19 at their Albany Bakery Durban branch. The company posted its statement on Twitter, confirming the temporary closure of their bakery as a precautionary measure after some staff tested positive for the virus.  Tiger Brands says they have taken a decision in the interest of the health and safety of all its employees at the bakery. The company, in a statement, said an employee informed them of flu-like symptoms at the beginning of this month. The employee was advised to get medical attention and a test was conducted. The results came back positive on Thursday 9 April. The company says all employees who had come into close contact with the individual were identified and sent for precautionary testing and self-isolation as they were asymptomatic. Tiger Brands has assured customers that they are safe as their bread manufacturing is highly automated from mixing, baking, slicing, sealing into tamper-proof bags and crating. Meanwhile, the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu)  is calling on the eThekwini municipality to make sure that all staff are protected after a Durban Solid Waste employee tested positive for COVID-19. “We have one member who tested positive. She is a patient who was attended to at St Augustine’s Hospital, ” says Samwu eThekwini Regional Secretary Xolani Dube. As the number of cases continues to surge, Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)  KwaZulu-Natal  Secretary Edwin Mkhize says unions must not be left out in fighting against COVID-19.
