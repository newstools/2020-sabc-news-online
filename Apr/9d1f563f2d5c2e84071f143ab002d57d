The Botswana government says its economy is expected to contract by 13%. Finance minister Thapelo Matsheka says they had expected their economy to grow by 4%, but due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), that has adversely affected their economy, things have changed.  Matsheka says Botswana government had projected 62.4 billion Pula, equivalent of over R90 Billion of revenue, but government will instead have 48 billion Pula, which is an equivalent of R74 Billion. As a result salary increases for public servants have been deferred.
