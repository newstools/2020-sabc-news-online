The number of persons who have recovered from COVID-19 infections has quadrupled. This can be seen in the figures that were revealed by Health Minister Zweli Mkhize when he released the latest confirmed COVID 19 cases. The latest confirmed COVID 19 cases are 2003. This figure includes the active cases, those who have passed on and the recoveries. Out of the 2003 recorded confirmed cases, 410 people have recovered, 24 patients have died and the remaining are 1569 active cases of persons who are still infected with the coronavirus. The figure for the recoveries is three times more than the previous one that was released on Wednesday which stood at 95. The latest figure released on Good Friday shows an improvement of 315 more people who have recovered, bringing the total recoveries to 410.   In this video below Health Minister addresses the media:   Minister Mkhize on Friday said the public and private hospitals will be working together in the fight against COVID-19. He warned South Africans not to become complacent about the pandemic, saying that the country is facing a delayed storm with the COVID-19. “To defeat COVID-19 is no longer an issue of a nurse and a doctor it is actually about society it is actually about going in a combat zone and fighting this infection I do want to say that at this point the indications we have as President has indicated are very promising but we did say before while we see some very promising elements in the response it is still too early and therefore if there’s any turn in the events in the outbreak we may not have other warnings so I think it is important for us to keep remembering that we are still traversing through a storm that is gathering and the storm is not over.”
