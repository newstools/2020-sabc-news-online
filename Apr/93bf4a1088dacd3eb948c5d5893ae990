Africa Teen Geeks have launched their digital school which aims to help school pupils to continue with their studies during this 21 days national lockdown. An artificial-intelligence based educational platform, MsZora, will be offering Lockdown classes live until next week. The initiative is aimed at supporting the Department of Basic Education’s efforts to keeping learning and teaching going even during the current lockdown following the closure of schools to combat the spread of Coronavirus.   The virtual classrooms, which are offered at no cost to pupils, will be recorded and posted on Africa Teen Geeks, MsZora and the Department of Basic Education website. This will give pupils who missed out on the day’s lessons an opportunity to access the content at all times.    Teachers from Grade R to Grade 12 who have reliable internet connection and knowledge on the country’s CAPS curriculum, are also encouraged to take part in the program. Learners have an opportunity to suggest desired topics per subject, and will also interact with educators during the live stream. Former president Thabo Mbeki, UN Women’s executive director Phumzile-Mlambo-Ngcuka, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, deputy Minister Enver Surty and former Statistician-General Pali Lehohla are some of the digital readers of the e-learning materials.
