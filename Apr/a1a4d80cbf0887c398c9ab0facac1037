The City of Johannesburg will from Monday start issuing temporary permits allowing informal food traders to operate as providers of essential services during the lockdown period. This is in line with Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s announcement last week that all spaza shops and informal food traders would be allowed to trade provided they had a permit from their municipalities. The City says only informal food traders registered on the city’s database and that of the Joburg Fresh Produce Market will be considered.  Joburg Member of the Mayoral Committee on Economic Development Lloyd Phillips outlines some of the documents needed to apply for the permit.

“The COJ certificate of acceptability from the Environmental Health Department is needed, proof of trading either via JPC statement or a smart card will be accepted, valid ID document is required as well together with an ID or passport sized photo.  This process will run from Monday the 6th of April to Wednesday the 8th of April 2020 at 66 Jorrissen street, Jorrissen Place in Braamfontein.” In the video below, Minister Dlamini-Zuma announces amended regulations:  Below is the summary of the revised lockdown regulations:
