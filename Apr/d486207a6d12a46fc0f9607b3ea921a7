On Sunday all Education MECs will meet with the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, to present plans aimed at rescuing the academic school year. Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi says he hopes that matric learners would be allowed to go back to class. However, Lesufi says, Gauteng will not risk the lives of learners. Lesufi expects the minister to announce the way forward on Monday.   “It is the call of the minister, and also the call of the President, whether our children should go back to school or not. But we miss them, I must be honest,” Lesufi says. “And parents have indicated that these bundles of joy are creating problems for them. As a department, teachers and parents, as well as learners, if all of us are convinced and assured that our school buildings are safe then we can allow education to move  on.” Video below on the impact of of COVID-19 on basic education:
