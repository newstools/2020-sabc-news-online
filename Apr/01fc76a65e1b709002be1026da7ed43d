The University of Cape Town (UCT) has set up a COVID-19 emergency fund to assist in the fight against the virus and its impact on the university. The institution has urged members of the UCT community to make contributions to the fund. Spokesperson, Elijah Moholola, says any amount by members of the UCT community, including alumni, staff and students will go a long way towards assisting the university in adjusting to these extraordinary times. “Donations can be made to a specific COVID-19 fund or online. UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng will donate 20% of her salary to the fund for a three-month period.” “Professor Phakeng already donates 10% of her salary monthly to the Mamokgethi Phakeng Scholarship Fund set up when she took office in July 2018.” In the video, various SA universities initiate online learning:  On Monday, Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape released an online orientation programme aimed at introducing students to online learning.
