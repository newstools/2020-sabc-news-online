Economic impact Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago says the extension of the lockdown period is expected to have a severe impact on the economy, with an expected increase in job losses. His comments follow a unanimous decision by the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to once again cut interest rates by one-percentage-point for the second time in less than a month. This brings down the repo rate to 4.25%, the lowest rate ever recorded. “South Africa’s lockdown has been extended by an additional fourteen days, bringing the total lockdown period to 35 days.
