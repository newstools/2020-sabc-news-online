Police Minister Bheki Cele says SAPS will not apologise for the arrest of a group of Muslim worshippers in Mpumalanga last weekend. The congregants were arrested in Mbuzini, Mpumalanga, during a prayer gathering. Cele says the apology is only for the blasphemous comments made by some of the police. He says police will arrest them again if they break the lockdown regulations by congregating. In this video below, Mohammed Abdullah says police need more training on how to deal with religious gatherings that violate lockdown regulations.  The Minster was responding to questions raised by some members of the Portfolio Committee on Police and the Select Committee on Security and Justice during a virtual briefing. “Unfortunately people who went there to pray and breaking the law converted the church into a crime scene. Police went to the crime scene and not to the church. So if it was a church and people were praying, we could not have done that.” “What we have apologised for, it is insensitive and blasphemy against Muhammad. As I would apologise when anybody insults Jesus, I am a Christian I will apologise for that. But for arrest that took (place) the police did very well. They will do that again if people go and break the law. And the police will do what they are supposed to do.” Cele called on religious leaders to observe the lockdown regulations and not organise gatherings. Social media users were divided over the issue on Saturday night.
