Dischem pharmacy has closed its Bluebird store in Johannesburg after a staff member tested positive for the coronavirus. Dischem, however, says the shop should re-open on Friday. The pharmaceutical retailer says the staff member in question was sent home to self-isolate and seek medical care. In a statement, Dischem says it has outsourced a professional cleaning service to deep clean the whole shop. The Health Department earlier announced that the number of confirmed cases now stands at 2 506 with 34 deaths.

Healthcare workers continue to contract coronavirus Nursing union, Denosa, says it is concerned that healthcare workers continue to contract COVID-19 while on duty. Twelve staff members of Mediclinic Morningside in Sandton, including seven healthcare workers, have tested positive for the virus. Last week, the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department shut down Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital after more than 60 people tested positive for COVID-19 including 47 staff members. “We urge the management and the leadership, if not the owners of the hospital groups, to take necessary precautions. It is sad that healthcare workers who are supposed to be helping are also faced with the same challenge of testing positive for COVID 19. We urge health workers to take necessary precautions that are there, but we also say Mediclinic must provide the necessary PPE to prevent any future spread,” says Denosa President Simon Hlungwani.
