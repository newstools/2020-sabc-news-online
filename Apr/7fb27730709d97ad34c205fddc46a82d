Leadership expert Mazwe Majola says President Cyril Ramaphosa has been inconsistent in dealing with members of his cabinet in relation to their personal handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa placed Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams on special leave for two months, one month of which will be unpaid. In the Audio below, Ramaphosa’s spokesperson explains why Ndabeni-Abrahams has been place on special leave:  Majola says while Communication’s Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has been placed on special leave for two months, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has not been sanctioned for a video in which she joked about staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic. “People will ask why Stella and not Lindiwe because they are both cabinet ministers they are there in the Natiional Command Council.” ”So all of them they must set an example, all of them they must be responsible. You cannot be inconsistent if you are a leader. So this one is very wrong, it is going to raise many questions from many people,” explains Majola. Last month, a short video clip of Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu joking about how she was struggling to stay home during the novel coronavirus outbreak, went viral on social media. But the minister has since apologized for the video.   Mixed reactions to Ndabeni-Abrahams’ suspension The Democratic Alliance also called for Ramaphosa fire and lay a criminal complaint against the minister. The party’s spokesperson on communications Phumzile van Damme says Ramaphosa’s sanction against Ndabeni-Abrahams is not enough. Van Damme says while the DA also notes Ndabeni-Abrahams’ apology, ‘this is not enough’, – because COVID-19 has killed thousands of people across the globe. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is calling for the removal of Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni- Abrahams from cabinet for breaching lockdown regulations. In a statement, the EFF says, “The two-month censure imposed on the Minister for breaching the lockdown is nonsensical and suggests that Ministers and Members of the Executive must be treated as if they are above the law. Ordinary citizens are subjected to the full might of the law should they breach lockdown regulations. For one to have lunch with friends while our people observe the lockdown is insulting and undermining.” The party will lay a charge against the Minister and Manana on Wednesday afternoon.
