So far at least 21 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Mpumalanga. Health Spokesperson, Dumisani Malamule says the 24hr clinic will resume operations on Friday morning. “We have decided (as) the department that we will be fumigating. Because one of the patients that came to test, their results came back positive and as a precautionary measure we had decided that we need to fumigate.” ”Not necessarily that because it is infected, but as the department we care about the lives of people. So we need to make sure that people are not affected.” “So we are then going to be fumigating, it is a 24-hour clinic. so we did not want to compromise service delivery and then Friday we are going to have the clinic open and it is going to operate normally,” adds Malamule. 66 people test positive for COVID-19 at St Augustine Hospital Meanwhile, 66 people have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) at St Augustine Hospital in Durban.
