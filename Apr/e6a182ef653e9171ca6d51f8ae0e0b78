Some Christians in Cape Town observed Palm Sunday, which marks the beginning of Holy Week, differently this year. Various churches in and around the city centre were closed for Sunday service to comply with lockdown regulations aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19. The doors to the historic Anglican St George’s Cathedral in Wale street were among those closed. Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba says all Anglican Churches in South Africa have suspended services. “Through IT, through Zoom, through Facebook, through Facebook Hangout, churches are continuing and prayers are continuing. We will re-evaluate and we will re-open as and when it is safe in the country. God bless you on this Palm Sunday,” says Makgoba. Makgoba says the Anglican Church of South Africa is committed to complying with government’s regulations regarding social distancing. “We are concentrating on helping people to understand the message of social distancing, following the hygienic protocols by the government and to support as much as possible the testing tracing and treatment of the government and we also contributing to funds like the Solidarity fund and funds to feed God’s people,” says Makgoba. Various other churches such as the Catholic St Mary’s Church opposite Parliament and the Dutch Reformed Church in Seapoint were also closed. In Khayelitsha, on the Cape Flats, several makeshift and open-air churches were also closed. In the video below, is a discussion on the impact of COVID-19:
