The Free State government has assured residents of QwaQwa and surrounding areas that water will flow from their taps again from Tuesday. The area has battled chronic water shortages for over a decade. Water struggles in the area are well-documented. They were the reasons behind recent violent protests in the area, which led to the temporal closure of schools and hospitals in the area. The residents’ anger had been exacerbated by the death of seven-year-old Mosa Mbele, who drowned while fetching water at a stream. In the video below, QwaQwa residents say they walk long distances to fetch water:  Residents, who had to form long queues at few running taps and water tankers, have expressed happiness at the prospect of this now being a thing of the past. “I will be happier because this thing of coronavirus has been causing as many problems as we could not even wash our hands.“ Free State Co-operative Governance MEC Thembeni Nxangisa says the Fika Patso Dam is 40% full. Nxangisa says that’s enough water to supply the region for at least the next six months. “We have prepared everything; the plant is working correctly and cleaning water. We are opening water tomorrow (Tuesday) as per the instructions of the Premier so we are to give people water from their taps. The only advice is that they must fix their taps to avoid mess up.” In the video below, two people drown in QwaQwa due to the area’s water challenges:
