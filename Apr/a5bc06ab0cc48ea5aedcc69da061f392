Both government, business, labour and civil society agreed to prioritise measures to contain the spread of virus and to minimise the loss of life. They all agreed to give their full support to proposed economic recovery measures and lend social support to the countryâ€™s most vulnerable. President Ramaphosa also urged business and labour to cooperate to ensure social protection for workers during the lockdown.
