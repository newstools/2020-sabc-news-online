Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko has condemned the gruesome murder of a five-year-old boy from Orange Farm in Johannesburg. The child’s naked body was found inside a tavern. This is the second murder of a child in the province since the lockdown was implemented. Mazibuko and acting Social Development MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the family in Orange Farm. They also visited a family in Tembisa, where an 11-year-old boy was found decapitated in a field in Mayibuye, Rabie Ridge last weekend.  Mazibuko says the killing of children will not be tolerated. “It’s a body of a five-year-old who was found in a tavern between a fridge and a counter. We don’t want to allege that it’s a muti killing; it’s people who say so. The family will also be able to share with us.” On 5 April, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi confirmed the murder of a 14-year-old Grade 9 girl learner from Aurora High School. Siphiwe Sibeko’s body was found in bushes in Emndeni extension, in Soweto. Her family had reported her missing after she did not return from a local spaza shop in Dobsonville.
