In a tweet, MEC for Education in Gauteng Panyaza Lesufi said, “This morning it’s Soshanguve Secondary School. We lost four schools in a week…” “We really don’t know what is happening in Soshanguve, this is to register our plea with the Security Cluster to protect our schools. We are dismayed to report about yet another school destroyed by fire, worse within few days in the same area. This is worrisome, it looks like same modus operandi is used, we are tempted to believe that there is a syndicate operating in the area, the sooner these cowards are arrested the better,” Lesufi said in a statement. He added saying that collectively there has been around 22 schools vandalized in Gauteng since the beginning of the lockdown period. All valuable equipment and furniture in the administration office was lost in the fire and the value of the loss is still to be determined. The fire department has launched an investigation to determine the cause of fire. Police are also investigating circumstances surrounding this incident.
