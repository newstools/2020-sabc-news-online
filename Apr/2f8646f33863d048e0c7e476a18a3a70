Freedom Front Plus Leader (FF Plus), Pieter Groenewald says he will test for coronavirus on Wednesday. Groenewald’s decision came after African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) leader, Kenneth Meshoe tested positive for COVID 19 after a religious gathering in Bloemfontein. In the video below, Kenneth Meshoe and Steve Swart test positive for COVID-19:  He also attended the meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa and other party leaders. Groenewald says he will make his results public. He explains how he had contact with Meshoe. “In the meeting itself, it was quite a distance from him, but during the photo session with the president, I stood right behind him. I will undergo the test but on advice from my medical practitioner, he said that we must wait the for 14-days. And now that time has elapsed and therefore, I will go for the test and I will inform everybody of the result of it. I think that I have the responsibility towards my loved ones, – my family and the people towards which I had been in contact to inform them about the results.” In the tweet below Groenewald encourages South Africans to stay at home:  Latest COVID-19 statistics in South Africa:  Reduce the risk of coronavirus infection:
