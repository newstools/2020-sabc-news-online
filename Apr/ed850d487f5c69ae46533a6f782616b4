Botswana’s first coronavirus-related death was a 79-year-old woman,  who reportedly travelled through South Africa and was placed in quarantine. The news of the death came only hours after president Mokgweetsi Masisi declared a state of emergency and announced a 28-day lockdown from Thursday in the country. Masisi says the threat to Botswana has escalated as neighbouring countries continue to report increasing cases of COVID-19. He is concerned by the low rate of testing in the country especially after the influx of his citizens returning from high risk countries which now imposed lockdowns. Masisi says this prompted the decision to institute the 28-day lockdown.  The deceased was the fourth case of COVID-19 registered in Botswana. The country’s vice president Slumber Tsogwane says the 14-people who have been in contact with her, have also been quarantined. “The 79-year-old lady of Ramotswa travelled to Motswedi. She was buried on March 28 and had been on home quarantine. Contact tracing of 14-people is underway.” In the video below, it is reported that there are 4 871 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa:
