Gauteng police have appealed to parents to ensure children obey the lockdown regulations.  They say many children are roaming the streets and this put them at risk of contracting the coronavirus. Police say it is difficult to make an arrest to these children because they need guidance from their parents to be indoors. Police spokesperson Mashadi Selepe says some people do not take the virus seriously. “This time is not about arresting. It’s about making a contribution as part of government. We’ve got our social crime prevention. They will go out and take the kids home look for parents. It is something that is very difficult. We haven’t enforce the law with the children because these people are just children and they just need guidance.” In the video below, ways children can keep busy during lockdown:  Twenty four people in South Africa have died from the virus and 2 003 others are infected.
