Politicians from five African countries are calling for an African Union (AU) investigation into claims of discrimination and abuse against African migrants in China. The group has written an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa in his capacity as the AU Chairperson. It includes South Africa’s Mmusi Maimane, Uganda’s Bobi Wine; born Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, and Zimbabwe’s Nelson Chamisa. Maimane says a continental response to the matter is needed.  He says the Presidency has acknowledged receipt of the letter via email. The call comes amid reports alleging abuse of hundreds of African migrant workers and students in China’s city of Guangzhou. One South African who spoke to SABC News recently says she was subjected to several COVID-19 tests despite having tested negative for the virus. She was allegedly also kicked out of her apartment, with her landlord telling her that the community had said it doesn’t want foreigners in the neighbourhood. In the video below, the woman speaks about the alleged abuse:  The Chinese government has refuted claims of the alleged ill treatment of Africans in the country. It has also assured AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat that it is working to improve the situation of African migrants in that country.  More than 4 000 people have died in China from COVID-19 so far with more than 82 000 cases confirmed.
