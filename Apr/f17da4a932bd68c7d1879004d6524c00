There have been reports of alleged brutality by some SANDF and SAPS members who have been deployed to enforce compliance to the national lockdown. Last month, Police Minister Bheki Cele said his department is investigating 26 cases related to police brutality across the country. An Ekurhuleni Metro Police officer was arrested in Gauteng, in connection with an alleged fatal shooting of a man at Vosloorus township, east of  Johannesburg. A 40-year-old man from Alexandra, north of Johannesburg,  died after he was allegedly assaulted by members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). It was reported that the deceased was having a drink with a neighbour inside their yard when a soldier asked them why they were drinking and were not inside the house. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula pleads with SANDF personnel to refrain from using excessive force against people.
