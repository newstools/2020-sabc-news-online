Struggle stalwart and Rivonia trialist, Denis Goldberg has died at the age of 87, late Wednesday night, following a lengthy battle with cancer. Goldberg was one of the eight Rivonia Trialists who were convicted alongside former President Nelson Mandela for treason. He served about 22 years of his sentence. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has confirmed his passing. According to the Presidency, Goldberg was born in Cape Town in 1933 and grew up in an intellectual family, becoming aware of national as well as international politics at an early age. In the early 1950s, Goldberg joined the Congress of Democrats and the Communist Party underground. His keen sense of justice prompted him early on in life to fight injustices in this country. He was the only white member of  Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) – an armed wing of the ANC – to be arrested and sentenced.
