China must do more to help ease the debt burden of African countries facing economic calamity as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Ghana’s finance minister Ken Ofori-Atta said. Though Africa accounts for just a fraction of global cases of the disease, its countries already face the grim impacts, with the continent’s economies expected to contract, putting about 20-million jobs at risk. “My feeling is that China has to come on stronger,” Ofori-Atta said during a conversation on Monday with Masood Ahmed, president of the Washington-based Center for Global Development that was posted on the think-tank’s website. “African debt to China is $145-billion or so, over $8-billion of payments is required this year … So that needs to be looked at.” African governments are calling for $100-billion in assistance, including support for a moratorium on all external debt and eventually some debt write-offs.
