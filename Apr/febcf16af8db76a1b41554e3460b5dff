Justice and Correctional Services minister, Ronald Lamola, has announced strict regulations to govern how courts will operate during the nationwide lockdown. The regulations published in the government gazette on Tuesday are part of broader efforts aimed at combating the spread of the coronavirus.  The regulations include restricting access to courts. Only persons with a material interest in the case such as a litigant, accused, witness or persons who are providing support to children or persons with disabilities will be allowed into the courtroom. People who have been out of the country a week before the National State of Disaster was declared will only be allowed in courts if they’ve been screened and found not to be infected with COVID-19. All criminal trials will be postponed until after the lockdown and persons arrested for a petty offence must be released on warning to be in court in a future date. The regulations also require legal practitioners involved in urgent litigation to get permission from the provincial director of the Legal Practice Council.
