Italy reported its lowest daily rise in COVID-19 deaths for nearly two weeks on Saturday and said the number of patients in intensive care had fallen for the first time. Officials urged the country not to flout strict lockdown measures they said were starting to show results, although new cases rose by 4805 on Saturday which was slightly higher than recent daily increases. In this video, Italian military enforces coronavirus lockdown: The Civil Protection department reported 681 deaths, bringing the total to 15.632 since the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic in northern Italy on February 21. It was the lowest daily rise in deaths since March 23. The total number of confirmed cases rose to 124.632 from 119,827 reported on Friday but for the first time, the number of patients in badly stretched intensive care units fell, with 3994 patients being treated, down 74 from 4068 on Friday. “This is an important piece of news because it allows our hospitals to breathe,” Civil Protection head Angelo Borelli told a regular daily briefing where he has announced the grim daily tally of the world’s most deadly outbreak of the disease. For days, Italian officials have said that broadly stable rises in the number of cases suggested that the outbreak had reached a plateau and that the numbers would begin to go down – if strict lockdown measures were respected.
