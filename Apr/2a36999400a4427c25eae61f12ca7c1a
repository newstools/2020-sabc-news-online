National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole has condemned the killing of a 33-year-old police constable in Sandton, north of Johannesburg. Percy Ramalepe and a colleague responded to a complaint of domestic violence in Sandton.  The suspect, a 60-year-old man, allegedly produced a firearm and shot Ramalepe without a warning. The suspect is believed to have then turned the gun on himself. Both the police officer and the suspect were declared dead at the scene. Commissioner Sithole says he’s saddened by the killing of the officer in the line of duty and has sent his condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. Meanwhile, Sitole has revealed that 12 members in the Police Services have been infected with COVID-19. “We must also sadly say up to this far, we have 12 cases of infections in the services, but it has been through the job we are doing. But then those particular members are given special support and this is the demonstration of how much the risk is. I then want to remind you about the existence of the police safety strategy. I just want to make a plea to you please make use of them.”
