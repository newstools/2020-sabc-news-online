The Gauteng Traffic Police is calling on motorists to be extra careful on the wet roads. The South African Weather Service has predicted that rain will continue throughout the weekend until Monday.  Gauteng Traffic Police spokesperson, Obed Sibasa, has also warned that they will arrest those who are driving illegally. “Roads are wet, slippery and dangerous. Headlights on, reduce speed and increase the following distance. Fewer accidents if not bumped based incidents that’s good news. If you do not have a valid reason to be on the road, stay home. Otherwise, we will give you a free ride to the cells,” says Sibasa. This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of emergency and the country to be under lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown began on March 26 and will end on April 16. The lockdown makes provision for essential workers to work, and grocery shops and pharmacies to open. The rest of the citizens are urged to stay at home and only go out to buy groceries or to seek medical help.
