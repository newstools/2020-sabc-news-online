The family of an Alexandra man who was beaten to death allegedly by members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in the township, north of Johannesburg, has been offered legal help.  Forty-year-old Collin Khosa died on Friday evening following the assault which happened in the afternoon. The family says Khoza and a few other family members were sitting in their yard when soldiers accosted them. They have since opened a murder case. The SANDF says it will co-operate with a police investigation into the incident. The deceased’s partner Nomsa Montsha is demanding answers from the state . “We need so many answers, and no one tells us. When they came to us, the reason was that they were looking for the beers and they couldn’t find those beers. So, we don’t know the reason for beating them because they could not find what they were looking for. I’m afraid of the soldiers. I thought they were people that must protect us. So, now I don’t  know. When I see them on the street must I run or must I feel protected?” In the video below, Montsha says she is grateful for the legal assistance she is getting:  Below are some of the lockdown regulations:   Loading… (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
