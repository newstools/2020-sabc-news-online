The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has condemned President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of United States (US) funding from the World Health Organisation (WHO), saying it is wrong to make such a move in the midst of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Trump accused the WHO of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China.  EFF National Spokesperson, Vuyani Pambo, says this decision highlights Trump’s deep disdain for human life. He says the actions are not only a direct attack on the health of other nations, but a threat to the livelihood of US citizens. The EFF has called on Trump to reconsider his decision.

Ghebreyesus says the WHO is making plans to fill any financial gaps that may result from Trump’s decision. “We regret the decision of the president of the US to order a halt in funding to the WHO. WHO is reviewing the impact of our work on any withdrawal of US funding and will work with our partners to fill any financial gaps we face and to ensure our work continues uninterrupted.
