British Prime Minister Boris Johnson left hospital on Sunday and thanked the National Health Service for saving his life, saying “things could have gone either way” for him as he battled COVID-19. Johnson, 55, was taken to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London on April 5, suffering from persistent symptoms of the disease caused by the new coronavirus. On April 6 he was moved into intensive care, where he remained until April 9. In this video, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he tested positive for coronavirus:  “I have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS has saved my life, no question,” he said in a five-minute video message posted on Twitter from 10 Downing Street. He named and thanked the nurses who had cared for him, with a special mention for two of them, Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal, who he said had stood by his bedside for 48 hours “when things could have gone either way”. “The reason, in the end, my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed,” he said. Johnson wore a suit and tie and spoke in his usual energetic manner. In characteristic fashion, he made a joke, thanking the doctors who had cared for him, “several of them for some reason called Nick”. President Ramaphose’s message of support to British PM President Cyril Ramaphosa has joined world leaders in sending messages of support to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened on Monday. The 55-year-old has been given oxygen at a London hospital but is not yet on a ventilator, with authorities saying he has a persistent high temperature. In a tweet of support to Johnson, Ramaphosa says despite the world going through a challenging period, we shall overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.
