The Mduduzi Manana Foundation has claimed in a statement that Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni Abrahams was visiting the Manana home to collect supplies of gloves, masks and sanitisers and was not simply having lunch with the family. A picture of Minister Ndabeni Abrahams and her husband sitting at a table and apparently having lunch at the Fourways home, in northern Johannesburg, started doing the rounds on social media.   The picture, which was in apparent contravention of lockdown regulations, has been met with outrage on social media.    President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will meet with the Minister to get her side of the story. Mananaâ€™s Foundation claims the family was having lunch and courteously asked the Minister to join them after she arrived to pick up the items. Attempts to reach Manana directly for comment have been unsuccessful.
