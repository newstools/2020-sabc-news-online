Africans in Guangzhou, China, are complaining that Chinese authorities in the city have subjected them to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing as the country seeks to contain cases of imported infections. However, China says while it has managed to contain the spread of local infections, there have been cases linked to the Nigerian community in the city that have sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and official charged with the prevention of infections. Authorities say Guangzhou had confirmed 114 imported coronavirus cases as of Thursday, 16 of which were Africans. The rest were returning Chinese nationals. Media reports indicate that several Africans have been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. Video footage shared on social media showed African sleeping on the streets.   There are credible reports about a widespread crackdown on Africans in Guangzhou who are being forced to leave hotels and residences with some people apparently now rendered homeless.   Like many countries across the world, China has banned foreign nationals from entering the country and many travellers are being sent into 14-day quarantine.

He says those affected will be assisted accordingly. But there are opposing reports which suggest that some of the evictees do not hold valid documentation.
