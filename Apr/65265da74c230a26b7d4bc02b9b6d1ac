The Bank of Namibia expects the domestic economy to contract by a record 6.9% this year, owing to coronavirus-induced travel restrictions and a nationwide partial lockdown, against a contraction of 1.1% last year. In a statement, the bank said the economy was expected to recover moderately in 2021. Last yearâ€™s contraction was caused by a drought and falling output in sectors such as construction and retail, while this year the economic shutdown to tackle COVID-19 has hit tourism and damaged other sectors. The virus has so far only infected 16 people and caused no deaths in the country.
