The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday reported 981 246 cases of new coronavirus, an increase of 23 371 cases from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by 1 336 to 55 258. The CDC reported its tally of cases of the respiratory illness known as COVID-19, caused by a new coronavirus, as of 4p.m. ET on April 27, compared with its count a day earlier. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said the United States was considering having passengers on international flights from coronavirus hot spots be tested for the virus. “We’re looking at doing it on the international flights coming out of areas that are heavily infected,” Trump said at a White House event. He said his administration was working with airlines on the plan, which could happen “in the very near future.” He said Brazil was one of the countries “getting to that category” of being a hot spot. Earlier this year, passengers from China were screened at US airports after landing in an effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Only a handful of passengers were quarantined. “I did it with China, I did it with Europe — that’s a very big thing to do. It’s certainly a very big thing to do to Florida, because you have so much business from South America,”Trump said.
