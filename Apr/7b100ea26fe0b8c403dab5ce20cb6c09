Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has provided more information on the paying of South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grants and the unemployment grant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zulu says older persons and persons with disabilities will receive their social grants on the third of every month or the nearest working day after this date when the third falls on a weekend or a public holiday. Zulu has addressed a media briefing in Pretoria. She says unemployed South Africans can apply for the R350 grant by sending a WhatsApp message to 0600 123 456 and selecting Sassa or an e-mail to SRD@sassa.gov.za. Unemployed South Africans will receive this grant for six months. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced earlier this month as part of a social relief and economic support package of R500 billion. “In addition, a special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant of R350 a month for the next 6 months will be paid to individuals who are currently unemployed and do not receive any other form of social grant or UIF payment. The Department of Social Development will issue the requirements needed to access and apply for this funding,” said Ramaphosa.
