The United States could redirect the funding originally earmarked for the World Health Organisation to other aid groups. President Donald Trump hinted at this during his daily press briefing on coronavirus at the White House. Trump said on Tuesday he has instructed his administration to halt funding to WHO over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic while his administration reviews its response to the global crisis. Trump, at a White House news conference on Tuesday, said the WHO had “failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable.” He said the group had promoted China’s “disinformation” about the virus that likely led to a wider outbreak of the virus than otherwise would have occurred.  He again used the platform to rail against the United Nation’s Health Agency and talked about the US government’s initiative to address HIV and Aids in Africa known as PEPFAR. “Now, the $500 million that we save, we’ll determine; we’re going to make a determination over a little period of time. But they’re going to either have to make massive changes, I don’t even know if they’re going to be able to do that, or we’re going to give money to people. We want to help people. You know, what we do in Africa with AIDS, people have no idea what we do and the money we spent.” Trump says what is happening at WHO is a disgrace. “With the World Health Organisation, what’s happened there is a disgrace. Here’s the other thing: We pay $400 to $500 million a year. China is paying $38 to $39 and $40 million a year. And it’s like they control this group. I could do that too if I want to devote full time to it. I have some very capable people dealing with Dr. Tedros; okay? I could do it too; I could do very well with that.” In the video below, WHO says it regrets Trump’s decision to halt funding to the organisation.
