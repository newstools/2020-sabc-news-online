Community members of three of Durban’s largest townships have called on government to fast track the introduction of mobile testing for COVID-19. KwaMashu, Inanda and Umlazi are said to now have a number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus with one recorded death. These areas have been earmarked for mass screening. These townships are home to thousands of residents, with almost 70% of them living below the poverty line. These townships also have the highest number of people with chronic illnesses which puts them at risk of being infected with COVID-19. In the video below, mobile COVID-19 testing and screening units are deployed nationwide.  Meanwhile, Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital near Durban has been closed after eleven of its nurses tested positive for the coronavirus. KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala along with Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu earlier addressed the media in Durban. This followed a meeting of the provincial government’s command team responsible for dealing with COVID-19. The hospital is the same one at which a primary school teacher in Isipingo, south of Durban, died after testing positive for the virus.
