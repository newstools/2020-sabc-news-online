Former President Jacob Zuma has terminated the services of his attorney in the Arms Deal corruption case against him. The firm of well-known attorney, Eric Mabuza, will take over from Daniel Mantsha. The move was announced in a statement issued by the JG Zuma Foundation. Zuma will retain the services of Senior Council, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane. Zuma is due back in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on the 6th of May.

Zuma and French arms company, face charges of corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering in connection with South Africa’s multi-billion rand arms deal in 1999. The state re-instated charges against Zuma in 2018 after the case was dropped in 2009. Zuma and Thales filed an application for a permanent stay of prosecution in November 2018, which was dismissed in October last year. Zuma’s legal team then started an appeal process. According to the statement, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane has been briefed to set up a multi-skilled legal team that will assist in preparations for the trial. The foundation says Zuma wants to dispel the notion that he is employing the so-called Stalingrad strategy by using every legal avenue to avoid a criminal trial. Zuma says in the statement he is looking forward to the trial to shed light on who really benefited from the alleged Arms Deal corruption.
