Leader of the United Democratic Movement, Bantu Holomisa, is urging South Africans to celebrate the fruits of democracy, despite the huge challenges facing the country at the moment. Monday marks the 26th anniversary of the first democratic elections held on the 27 April 1994. Holomisa believes that real freedom will only be realized if the majority of citizens of South Africa have access to basic necessities. “It’s a different day because we are celebrating this freedom today being indoors due to COVID-19 pandemic and we hope that sooner or later this thing will be a thing of the past and we need to make sure that we develop our country and to see to it that the main objectives of our freedom are realized, especially among the majority citizens of this country.” Earlier, President Cyril Ramaphosa called on citizens to think of those less fortunate in these trying times. Addressing the nation, Ramaphosa said that while some South Africans have a fully stocked fridge and some minor inconveniences due to restrictions on movement, many are battling daily for their very survival. “This Freedom Day, we find ourselves engaged in a struggle that has thrown into sharp focus, the poverty and inequality that still defines our society. The coronavirus pandemic forces us to confront this reality. Though we are certainly all braving the same tide, we have not been impacted in the same way by this pandemic.” Below is President Cyril Ramaphosa’s full speech:  .
