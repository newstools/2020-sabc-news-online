Credible sources within SA Express have confirmed to SABC News that the embattled airlineâ€™s joint Business Rescue Practitioners will be filing for liquidation on Friday this week. Earlier on Tuesday, SA Express was placed under provisional liquidation after the Johannesburg High Court heard its case. The Business Rescue Practitioners of SA Express filed an urgent application to the High Court to have the airline liquidated last month. They argued that government withheld financial support and failed to provide post-commencement funding for SA Express for them to do their work. The Department of Public Enterprises was to respond on whether it would oppose the liquidation application, but failed to do so. All parties involved including unions will have to respond to the judgment. SA Express has been suffering financial difficulties for some time now including widespread corruption allegations laid bare at the State Capture Commission. The airline has also not paid its employees its March salaries.
