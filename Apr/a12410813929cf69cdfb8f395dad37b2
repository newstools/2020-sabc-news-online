Severe thunderstorms are expected in various areas, with predictions of cold weather and snowfall in the Drakensberg mountains.  Spokesperson for the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Senzelwa Mzila, says heavy downpours might lead to localised flooding, strong damaging winds and large amounts of small hail. “This weather warning is for areas in the following districts: Harry Gwala, Amajuba, uThukela, uMzinyathi, part of eThekwini and Zululand. MEC Sipho Hlomuka is urging communities in these areas to exercise extreme caution. He has also urged those that are part of the essential workers to exercise extreme caution on the roads as they can be slippery at this time,” says Mzila. Meanwhile, Mzila says so far no incidents have been reported. He has urged people who are using generators and other methods to keep warm, to exercise extreme caution. “The MEC is urging them to exercise extreme caution because we do know that generators as well need to be handled with great care especially in rural areas, if they are lighting imbawula or any other means to keep warm.
