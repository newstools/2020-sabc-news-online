President Cyril Ramaphosa says he is impressed by the work done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR ) in tracking the country’s COVID-19 cases. On Thursday, Ramaphosa visited CSIR in Pretoria to give support and encourage those who are in the forefront, fighting coronavirus, to keep up the good work. Technology is part and parcel of South Africa’s bid to track and contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The number of infections is still growing along with fatalities due to the virus. However, Ramaphosa says the CSIR is a blessing in a storm. “I’m delighted to have come here because this is where there is a platform of enabling the nation to deal with COVID-19 in a technological and scientific way and I’m hugely impressed.”  In an effort to boost the fight against the deadly virus, the private sector has also offered support. About 20 000 health workers will now receive cellphones with an app to assist them in executing their jobs. The President says that fellow South Africans can assist in this stormy period by staying at home and thus flatten the curve of COVID-19. “As a nation, we should be proud that we have an institution like the CSIR, which is always trying to be ahead of the curve in terms of bringing a solution.” In the video below, President Ramaphosa says he is delighted to have visited the CSIR Centre in Pretoria:
