Water and Sanitation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu says there are problems in distributing water tanks to various communities across the country, with some tanks being stolen. 16 000 tanks have so far been distributed throughout the country. As the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic, water is critical in stemming the spread of the virus. People need water for hand washing and general sanitation. Sisulu formed part of a media briefing in Pretoria on the socio-economic relief interventions. She says communities that still do not have water must alert her department on 0800 200 200. Sisulu says, “We have up to now provided in the region of 16 000 tankers throughout the country, we make sure we fill them up on a regular basis. We’ve had a bit of a problem in the installation of some of the tanks because people steal those tanks. Those people who have no access to water please call us so that we can locate where you are, we can locate your municipality and make sure that you do have water. It’s a toll-free number.” Below is the briefing on COVID-19 socio-economic relief interventions:  Mashishing residents Residents of Mashishing and surrounding areas in Mpumalanga continue to be faced with the shortage of water.
