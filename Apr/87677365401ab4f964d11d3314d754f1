The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal is calling on government to investigate allegations that some councillors are involved in the embezzlement of food parcels meant for vulnerable groups during the national lockdown. KwaZulu-Natal ANC spokesperson Ricardo Mthembu says the party has received complaints from community members that some ANC representatives are keeping the food parcels for themselves. Mthembu says such behaviour is tarnishing the party’s image. “It looks like now people are doing a very dangerous thing involving politics in this crisis where people are suffering because of the lockdown situation which is beyond government and beyond everybody.” ”So, as the ANC, we would like to caution people and we are concerned about people donating food parcels and of course those food parcels don’t reach the people who are supposed to get them.” ”We don’t want to see government programs of ensuring that people are assisted through food parcels being manipulated,” adds Mthembu.
