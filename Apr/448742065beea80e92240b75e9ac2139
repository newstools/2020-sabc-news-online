Long distance taxi operators in Mahikeng, in the North West, are requesting financial relief from government. They say the national lockdown has compromised their businesses. They also want better communication from the Transport Ministry on how best to mitigate this revenue shortfall. BOLLTA Taxi Association Vice-Chairperson Mbuti Makutle says they need more information: “The minister says he spoke to the banks, so that we may not pay for a certain period, and other people are going to be compensated. But to us, no one is talking about us. “We want to know whether or not we are going to be compensated or what? No one comes to us and shows us the real thing in black and white that we are not going to pay for three months.” In the video below, long-distance taxi operators in Mahikeng request financial relief from the government:
