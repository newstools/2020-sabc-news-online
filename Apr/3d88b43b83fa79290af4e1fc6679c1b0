Around 300 of them are living in tents put up as part of the lockdown regulations. The city is continuing efforts to round-up as many homeless people as possible to either put them up in tents or shelters. SABC News spoke to some of the city’s homeless. “Everyday they want to give us a cup of soup, we need coffee, we need mattresses, we need toiletries and people need blankets.
