The African Transformation Movement (ATM) has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa requesting him to convene a special meeting with all political leaders. The party says the meeting should discuss among others allegations that Ramaphosa met with billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates to discuss vaccines to be piloted on the continent. ATM writes to the president on issues regarding COVID-19:  This comes after Ramaphosa shared a video of an interview Gates did with The Daily Show host Trevor Noah about the initiatives the Bill Gates Foundation has funded in the fight against the coronavirus. Bill Gates commends Ramaphosa for swift action against coronavirus in South Africa:  The ATM has asked Ramaphosa to set the record straight on these matters to unite the country in fighting the virus.
