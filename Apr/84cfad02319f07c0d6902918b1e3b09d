An East London businessman is caught up in a racism storm, after his social media posting earlier this week. Russel Kruger allegedly posted a picture of his child on Instagram, with the face painted black and the caption: “Using my child to apply for business grants, hope we come right.”  A case of crimen injuria has been opened against him. The social media post that spurred the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) into action as the party opened a case against the businessman. EFF Eastern Cape Chairperson Yazini Tetyana says they want Kruger to face the same fate as convicted racist Vicky Momberg. “We want him to face a similar fate as Vicky Momberg and other racists that are there and are still hiding. East London is a hotspot for racism in our observation so we need to teach a lesson to Russel.”  Social media has been abuzz with angry responses. Among them, Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi, calling Kruger’s action as racist and bottom of the barrel behaviour.   There is also a twitter post, seemingly made by Kruger, in which he apologises for his behaviour. When approached by SABC News, Kruger declined to comment, except to say he was seeking legal advice. Tetyana says there are a lot of racist people hiding in East London. “There are elements that refuse to accept the new dispensation; racist elements. In East London I can assure you that there is quite a lot of them hiding; they come out one by one. We don’t have space for such racists. They belong in jail.” The Human Rights Commission says it will investigate the case.
