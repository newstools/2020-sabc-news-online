There’re people who don’t realise that the situation is serious.” ”Don’t allow people to run amok, don’t allow them to do as they wish when they’re told to go and sleep they must go and sleep. When they’re told to stay inside they must stay inside, they must not just gallivant and not know where they’re going,” explains the minister.
