The Eastern Cape Department of Health has received a large consignment of personal protective equipment (PPEs) to be distributed at various health facilities to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Provincial Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba says hotspot areas such as the Nelson Mandela Metro, Buffalo City and the Chris Hani District will be prioritised. “We had a meeting with the premier and he promised us that we’re awaiting stock that will be coming. So we’re giving that as evidence that the stock has arrived and that we’re distributing it. We’re pleading to our healthcare workers to really look after PPEs time and again because it is a scarce commodity and countries that are making this are holding to their stock,” says Gomba. High demand, short supply of PPEs Earlier this month, healthcare workers in Port Elizabeth hospitals said that they fear for their lives as they didn’t have the basic equipment to protect themselves.

In South Africa, healthcare bodies and unions have expressed concern about a lack of PPEs for frontline healthcare workers treating patients with the coronavirus.
