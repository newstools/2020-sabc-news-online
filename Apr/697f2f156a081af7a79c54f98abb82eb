Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has established an Economic Commission to assist the business sector after the coronavirus lockdown ends. Mabuyane says the commission will be looking at short, medium and long term solutions. He met with the Nelson Mandela Bay business sector in Port Elizabeth to find solutions and support from the business sector. The Eastern Cape economy relies heavily on the automotive industry. Mabuyane says a plan must be made to recoup all the production that has been lost. He says, “We’ve got to reconnect, re-kick-start this economy and our economy is anchored around the automotive industry. So it’s critical that we’ve got a common understanding and a common approach on whatever we are trying to do. Government continues creating a conducive environment for business to thrive.” In the video below, Eastern Cape to roll out COVID-19 testing: Support schemes for informal traders Small Business Development Minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says government is finalising the support scheme for informal traders and spaza shops.
