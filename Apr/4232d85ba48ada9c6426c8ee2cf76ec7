KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has announced that the province will intensify lockdown measures from Monday. Zikalala has been briefing the media in Durban saying that all is not well in the province, which has the highest number of COVID-19 related deaths at 21. He says screening and testing, as well as stricter law enforcement operations will be implemented, to limit people’s movements. “Provincial Command Council decided on Friday to implement an intensified lockdown in the eThekwini district. We’ve issued a directive to our law enforcement authorities to apply the law in it’s strictest form and to make sure that there are no compromises. We want them to make sure that the violation of the breakdown by the people who are supposed to be at home is met with comportment punishment,” says Zikalala.

The announcement has been made by premier Zikalala at a media briefing in Durban, where he called for stricter adherence to lockdown regulations. In this video below KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala addresses the media:  The proposal comes after the provincial Command Council has noted with concern the high number of COVID-19 deaths in the province, presently at 21. Zikalala says many who have been instructed to self-isolate, may not be practicing it optimally. “Those who are self-isolating far from strict supervision may interact with others and infect them. We are moving in a direction where all people who test positive will be placed in isolation in facilities demarcated by government and only return home when they are showing signs of improvement and are testing negative,” says Zikalala.
