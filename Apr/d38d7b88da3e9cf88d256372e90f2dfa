Kenya’s economic growth will slow to 3% or less this year from an earlier forecast of about 6% due to the effects of the novel coronavirus, its finance minister said on Tuesday. The finance ministry had earlier given a 6.1% growth forecast for 2020. “This will drastically drop to about 3% or even less, but we are going to give a firm figure when we will have taken on board the impact of this, maybe in the next one month,” Ukur Yatani said in comments broadcast on privately-owned Citizen Television.
