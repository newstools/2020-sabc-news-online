Former President Jacob Zuma celebrates his 78th birthday on Sunday and many have taken to social media to wish him a happy birthday. The former African National Congress (ANC) president, also affectionately referred to by his clan names Msholozi and Nxamalala, was born on 12 April 1942 to in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal. Zuma served as South African President from the 2009 general elections until 14 April 2018, when he resigned. He is loved for his cheerfulness and his singing.  However, his Presidency was marred by legal battles which he continues to fight. In 2005 while still deputy president, Zuma was accused of corruption and racketeering, which resulted in Schabir Shaik, his legal advisor, being convicted of corruption and fraud. The former president currently faces 18 charges of corruption.
