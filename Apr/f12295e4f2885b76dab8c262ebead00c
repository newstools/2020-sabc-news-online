Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has expressed concern over the rising numbers of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in the Western Cape. The Western Cape now has more than 1 500 infections. The Eastern Cape has 488 infections, but there has been reluctance from residents to adhere to lockdown regulations. Mabuyane says the military contingent in the province will be strengthened, to ensure compliance with the lockdown regulations. He says some victims, who die in the Western Cape, are buried in the Eastern Cape and there is a need to ensure the safety of all people who attend the funerals. “Those patients must be immediately buried so that we don’t have any further exposure. The more the numbers in Western Cape grow, the more we are worried in Eastern Cape. Some of those people who die in Western Cape because of coronavirus are buried here. “Our law enforcement is trying its level best.”  Loading… (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Concern over the Eastern Cape Meanwhile, there are concerns on how the Eastern Cape is dealing with the pandemic.
