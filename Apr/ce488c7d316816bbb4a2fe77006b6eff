Western Cape Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo has launched a COVID-19 screening and testing centre for the farming community of Ceres and Tulbagh. The area has been identified as a hotspot for the spread of the virus outside the Cape Metro. Ninety-three cases and two deaths have been reported in the area so far. Mbombo says most of the cases come from the agricultural sector. “To what is the readiness of the employers, the farmers, the shop owners to prevent the spread? Because in one facility, for example, 26 cases that came out, they ended up infecting the community. So, what is the readiness? The Mayors and Councillors are also here. So, what can they do? Their readiness for burials. So, what it is it that they can contribute because it’s not only the responsibility of the province; it is a national disaster.” In the video below, journalist Mariska Botha reports that cases in the Western Cape are moving from metros to villages:  The Western Cape has the most number of COVID-19 cases in the country with 1 737 cases.
