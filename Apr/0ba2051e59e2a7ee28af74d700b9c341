The United Nations  (UN) has urged creditors to grant a debt standstill for all developing countries, not just the poorest, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that many countries face debt distress due to a global recession. Addressing a virtual conference on Africa, hosted by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Guterres said the continent needed more than 200-billion dollars to respond to the pandemic and mitigate its economic impact. He said that IMF should allocate new Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in order to mobilize more resources. This is a step that has been opposed by the United States. An SDR allocation is akin to a central bank “printing” new money.  Africa has at least 18 000 cases of COVID-19, with more than 900 deaths. The video below puts the numbers into perspective.

The United Nations says ‘now is not the time’ to reduce resources for the operations of the World Health Organization,  (WHO) or any other humanitarian organization fighting COVID-19. This after US President Donald Trump announced a halting of funds to the UN’s Health Agency, to review its handling of the outbreak. Trump has accused the WHO of severely mismanaging and ‘covering up’ the extent of the crisis, on behalf of China. SABC News correspondent Sherwin Bryce-Pease reports on this matter from New York.
