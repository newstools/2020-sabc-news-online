The 53 people who were arrested at a wedding in eNseleni outside Richards Bay, in the KwaZulu-Natal north coast, are expected to appear in the Empangeni Magistrate Court on 11 June. They have been charged with the contravention of the Disaster Management Act, which prohibits public gatherings.  South African National Defence (SANDF) members and the police pounced on the wedding party during the matrimonial ceremony. The newly-weds and the pastor who officiated the wedding ceremony were among those arrested. They were all released on a R1 000 bail each on Sunday. National Police Spokesperson Vish Naidoo has urged the public to study the lockdown regulations. “There are certain exceptions to the rule of people gathering. People are allowed to gather for a funeral of more than 50 people and that funeral procession must lead straight from a mortuary to a crematorium or cemetery. Weddings are not allowed during this period. We advise people to read the regulation thoroughly to study the regulations so that they understand what is expected of them. Ignorance cannot be accepted as a ground of justification.” In the video below, 53 people are arrested at a wedding for violating lockdown rules:
