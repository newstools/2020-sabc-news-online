Motorists are advised to avoid Eloff Street in Johannesburg as a group of protesters blockaded the road with rocks and burning tyres. It’s understood that they are protesting after not receiving food parcels from government. Metro police officers are on the scene to monitor the situation. Johannesburg Metro Police Department Spokesperson Wayne Minaar says: “There’s currently a protest on Eloff Street between Selby and Rosetenville and it’s affecting traffic. Motorists are advised to avoid that road now because of rocks and burning tyres placed on the road where protestors are complaining after not having received food parcels. Motorists can use Booysens Road as an alternative route.” Calls to investigate food parcels theft Acting MEC for Social Development in Gauteng Panyaza Lesufi has urged community members to alert authorities of corruption in the delivery of food parcels in the province. Community members allege that councillors are keeping the parcels for themselves. The Democratic Alliance also alleges that wards led by the party in the Emfuleni Local Municipality in the Vaal have been excluded from the distribution process while all the African National Congress wards are benefiting. Department Spokesperson Thabiso Hlongwane says there are systems in place to curb corruption. “We have systems in place that ensure fair distribution based on the criteria we use to select households that qualify for food relief. Our system is both auditable and verifiable. Our officials receive verified names from our call centre. Where there is wrongdoing on part of the officials, the community or whistle blowers must report them for investigations.” In the video below, The Northern Cape Social Development Department ropes in the Hawks to deal with corruption in the distribution of food hampers:  -Additional reporting by Zoleka Qodashe
