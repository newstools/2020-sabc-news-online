Police Minister Bheki Cele has refuted claims that officers are going easy on cabinet ministers and other officials during the coronavirus lockdown. A picture of Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams having lunch with former MP Mduduzi Manana during the lockdown, sparked a heated debate on social media platforms.  President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed Ndebeni-Abrahams on special leave for two months, one of which is unpaid. He also ordered her to apologise to the nation for breaking the lockdown regulations. Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams apologises for breaking the lockdown regulations:  But many people on social media are questioning why she has not been arrested and charged. Minister Cele addressed the media at Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape. He says investigating officers are taking the matter forward. “Yes, the president has taken a decision with Minister of Communications and as we speak, since the president has taken that decision and also instructed the law enforcement agencies to work on the matter, I can tell you that the processes have been there. The investigating officers have met the minister and they are taking the matter forward. I know that they have spoken to Public Prosecutor and the matter is being taken forward. Surely, as the matter is summarised, everybody will know what has happened.” In the video below, some South Africans call for tougher action to be taken against Ndabeni-Abrahams.  Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner General Kehla Sithole has revealed that 12 members in the Police Services have been infected with COVID-19. “We must also sadly say up to this far, we have 12 cases of infections in the services, but it has been through the job we are doing. But then those particular members are given special support and this is the demonstration of how much the risk is. I then want to remind you about the existence of the police safety strategy. I just want to make a plea to you please make use of them.”
