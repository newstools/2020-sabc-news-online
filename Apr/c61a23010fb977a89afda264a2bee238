Gauteng Premier David Makhura has condemned alleged corruption in the distribution of food parcels to the needy during the lockdown period. Makhura was reacting to the allegations of the South African Civic Organisation (SANCO) in Tshwane that there is discrimination in the distribution of food parcels and that they are not reaching the intended beneficiaries. Over 400 food hampers are distributed daily. Makhura briefed the media on Tuesday during his visit to a COVID-19 food bank storage in Watloo, east of Pretoria. “This food bank must only distribute to people vetted and verified because they must go only to those who are needy. Every family that needs food must be assisted. We are also going to report to the command centre that we are going to need more food as more families continue to come forward,” says Makhura. In the video below, Makhura says more people are now in dire need of food supplies as a result of the lockdown:  Food parcels not for the politically connected During the launch of a food bank in Ekurhuleni in the Eastrand, Makhura said food parcels will only be given to those who need them most and not those who are politically connected. He also called for the fair distribution of food parcels.  Families, whose children already get food as part of the school nutrition programme will automatically qualify for food assistance. Makhura says there are five distribution points across Gauteng providing thousands of households with food each day. So far, 72 000 people have been assisted since the start of the lockdown three weeks ago. -Additional reporting by Tshepo Phagane
