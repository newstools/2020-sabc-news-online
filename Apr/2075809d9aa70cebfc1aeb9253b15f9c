Elanie and her dad are overjoyed. “We are very blessed and grateful that we have just been tested negative for the COVID-19 virus and this is all because we stick to the rules and we did what the doctors, Department of Health and what our president is asking from everyone in SA. We are very happy at this stage and we would like to thank everybody that helped us through this. Thank you. We beat it! Stick to the rules and keep your distance, and thank God we are through this and stay positive, please,” says Gerber. Gerber contracted the virus in March after he had travelled overseas. He had started feeling ill and experience body aches. He went to his doctor and was informed of his test results within 24 hours. “I just want to tell you guys to stay at home and go according to the rules. Don’t be a hero. Think of your family, your friends, the whole of South Africa and the whole world. It spreads like you can’t believe it. It is very dangerous if you don’t look after yourself. I am very positive and I know I will go through this,” says Gerber. In this video, Professor Helen Rees discusses SA’s COVID-19 curve:
