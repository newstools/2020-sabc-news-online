The former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Gauteng leader, Mandisa Mashego has denied that she is joining Herman Mashaba’s People’s Dialogue. This after she confirmed her resignation as the party’s caucus leader in the Gauteng Legislature and party chairperson in the province. The party has been dismissing the rumours of her leaving since the beginning of the year. Mashego contested and lost the race for the EFF’s secretary-general position earlier this year against Julius Malema’s close ally Marshall Dlamini. Mashego dismissed allegations that she is joining the People’s Dialogue. “I do have a lot of private discussion with Herman. I always have, especially during difficult times of his tenure as the Executive Mayor,  I’ve learned to respect him even though ideologically we’re still far apart but we have not yet had a discussion about me joining him. From what I know he has not established a political party, he has some kind of formation that he’s engaging citizens about what they want to see in next year’s elections and beyond and what kind of leadership they want to see in government. I’m aware of that and I’m not part of that.” In the video below SABC News reports on Mashego resigning from the EFF:
