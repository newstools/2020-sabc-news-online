SADTU concerned about school vandalism On Sunday, South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) in North West condemned the vandalism of schools in different parts of the province during the lockdown. 60 schools in the province have been vandalised. The union’s provincial secretary Els Themba said the department needs to take appropriate measures before the re-opening of schools. “We believe that the department should be able to make sure that they are able to put measures in place to make sure that those particular schools prior to the reopening, necessary arrangements are made so that proper schooling can resume on time when there is a directive when the schools should resume.”
