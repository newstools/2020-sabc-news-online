The Amampondomise nation is reviving an historical cultural practise to fight the spread of COVID-19. The nation has resolved to postpone all funerals and only do burials according to the ukuqusheka (private funeral , attended by close family members) tradition.

Government raise concerns about the role of funerals in the transmission of COVID-19:  There are currently 535 cases in the Eastern Cape. Ten deaths have been reported. The Amampondomise kingdom is the first in the Eastern Cape to suspend funerals. This decision was not taken lightly.

Once the lockdown is lifted then proper services will be accorded to those buried under ukuqusheka (private funeral , attended by close family members).
