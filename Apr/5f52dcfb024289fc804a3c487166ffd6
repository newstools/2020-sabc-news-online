The largest number of health workers comes from KwaZulu-Natal with 136 and the Western Cape has the least with two. Briefing the media on Tuesday night, Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize said one retired doctor died of coronavirus in the Free State. “Our biggest ammunition on fighting COVID-19 is a technical professional training among our health workers in the frontline. It is important for the health workers to be well trained, it is important for the health workers to be well protected. In this case, we have noticed that the protective gear tends to be a moving target, one time we have enough, one time there is a shortage, particularly that the whole world is looking for this protective gear. There is adequate stock to share among the various institutions.”  Full COVID-19 presentation below: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6879493-COVID-19-Media-Health-Presentation-28-April-2020.js", {

But in addition, it’s also important to say that there were a number of other factors that have to be taken into account such as the issue of food security, it has always been topmost in our minds as government. The balancing of the economy is important.” 93 COVID-19 related deaths have been recorded in South Africa while the number of confirmed cases has increased to 4 996. The latest deaths were all elderly people from the Western Cape. The Western Cape has recorded 38 deaths while Kwazulu-Natal has recorded 30 fatalities.
