The JS Moroka Local Municipality in Mpumalanga is refurbishing dysfunctional boreholes as a way of dealing with water shortages brought about by persistent drought. River and dam water levels are currently low. Mayor Thulare Madileng says they are ensuring that rural communities are getting access to adequate water by refurbishing boreholes, drilling of others and allocating water tanks. “This is how we are doing it so that our people are able to access clean water and also to ensure that testing a unit within the department of water services are able also to conduct an ongoing basis ensuring that there is compliance. The water that is delivered to the people is clean and does not cause illness to the residents of Dr J’s Moroka local municipality.” Meanwhile,  last week, Water and Sanitation Deputy Minister, David Mahlobo handed over boreholes in Jerusalem in Hazyview, Mpumalanga. Mahlobo also handed over water tanks to the Bushbuckridge Municipality. The measure is to mitigate challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in rural communities lacking water. SABC News reporter, Sphephile Kunene reports on efforts to mitigate water challenge in Mpumalanga.
