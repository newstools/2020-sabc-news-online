Ramjee had recently returned home from a trip to London and was admitted with pneumonia to a hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. Her research, which focused on ways to prevent HIV transmissions in women in South Africa, earned her recognition around the world. Mkhize says Ramjee will be missed. Ramjee grew up in Uganda. She later moved to India where she attended high school for several years. Ramjee then relocated to the north-east of England and attended the University of Sunderland. She joined the South African Medical Research Council as a scientist and progressed rapidly to senior scientist, division head, chief specialist scientist and then director of one of the largest units of the council. Ramjee worked in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention research, working with microbicide trials for over ten years. She also led a KwaZulu-Natal team working on an HIV Vaccine Trial.
