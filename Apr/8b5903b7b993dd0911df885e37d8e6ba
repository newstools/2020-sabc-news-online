The case of former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and her 17 co-accused has been adjourned until the 21 May due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. They are facing charges of fraud and corruption in connection with R430 million Durban Solid Waste tender. In March, eThekwini city manager Sipho Nzuza became the latest accused in the matter implicated alongside Gumede and others. In the file video below, Zandile Gumede’s corruption case postponed to April.  KwaZulu-Natal NPA spokesperson Natasha Ramkasoon-Kara says the matter was on the court roll for Thursday. “The matter of the state versus Zandile Gumede and others was on the court roll at the Durban Magistrate’s court today. The matter was postponed to the 21st of May 2020. No accused or accused or legal representative was in court this was due to prior arrangements in this regard.” Gumede is out on R50 000 bail while his co-accused are out on R5 000 bail each. The court alleges that they manipulated tender processes and split the contract between four inexperienced companies. In October 2019, the Hawks and the Asset Forfeiture Unit raided and seized assets at the former mayor’s Inanda home, north of Durban. In the video below, the Hawks raid Zandile Gumede’s home.  The ANC Women’s League came out in full support of Gumede in September. The league’s President, Bathabile Dlamini said it’s disappointing that women continue to be pushed back in the ANC and greater society, just for being women. “We think there’s a very strong push-back against women who stand up for themselves. We are not going to stop what the Secretary of UN said this year (2019) in March that we must push back the push-back. Secondly, we still believe that we all remain innocent until proven guilty.”
