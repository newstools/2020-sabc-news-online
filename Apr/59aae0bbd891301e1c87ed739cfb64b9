Fear gripped some of the residents of Hilton outside Pietermaritzburg when the country’s first COVID-19 was recorded there at the beginning of March. This has been replaced by adherence to the lockdown regulations, aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Empty roads and closed amenities greet one as you approach the Hilton area. Few cars are seen on the streets including those of law enforcement agencies. As the country enters the third week of lockdown, respecting regulations of the lockdown is sinking in for many.

Hilton resident, Sipho Mncube says after hearing South Africa’s first COVID-19 case is from the area, they were scared. He says they overcame that fear as they learnt what people can do to prevent being infected. “We were scared, but after learning more about the Coronavirus and how to try and prevent it by regularly washing of hands with soap; if one is coughing using elbow, that helps overcome it,” says Mncube. For Andrew Hulle and Estelle van Der Berg, also from Hilton, the extension of lockdown was a good call. “I think it was a good call. The President is a leader that inspired many. From what I’ve seen, people are adhering to the lockdown in this area and he did a great job. Initially, there were one or two people who tried not to adhere but the community was quick to say, ‘Listen. Go to your house. This is lockdown.’ If you get a walk up and down the street you get people asking you what you are doing. It’s quite a close community. What I miss the most is exercising and walking the dogs out, but we are grateful that we still have our jobs. We are able to work from home,” says these residents.

Meanwhile, in Pietermaritzburg’s Embali township, Sibongiseni Dladla says at the beginning of lockdown police had their hands full. Dladla says the extension of lockdown was an eye-opener for many, and they started adhering to regulations. “My mother owns a Tuck shop. People don’t come out in numbers anymore. My community does respect what is going on. At the beginning of lockdown, it was bad people who were not listening at all. They were going out, being chased by police. They were swearing at police, but the situation has gone down,” says Dladla. Out of the 25 people who have died from COVID-19 in the country so far, 12 are from KwaZulu-Natal.
