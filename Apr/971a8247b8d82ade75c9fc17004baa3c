Residents of the Matjhabeng Municipality in the Free State have lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) against the executive mayor Nkosinjani Speelman. This follows a social media video which has gone viral in which Speelman is allegedly heard using a derogatory term to refer to the coloured community of Bronville in Welkom. The incident allegedly took place when he addressed South African National Defence Force soldiers deployed in Matjhabeng to enforce lockdown regulations. The African National Congress in the province has since suspended Speelman. Angry residents are demanding his resignation. They say if Speelman does not resign then they are going to make Bronville ungovernable. In the video below, SABC’s Thabiso Radebe speaks about Nkosinjani Speelman’s suspension: Speelman apologises Speelman apologised to residents of Bronville after he used a derogatory word to refer to them. He was heard in a cellphone video telling soldiers that coloured people like to take chances when they are drunk and that soldiers must deal with them. He allegedly encouraged soldiers to ‘skop and donner’ those who break the law. He apologised after the SAHRC demanded an apology. The commission’s provincial manager Thabang Kheswa says they welcome Speelman’s apology. Below is statement by the ANC on Nkosinjani Speelman:
