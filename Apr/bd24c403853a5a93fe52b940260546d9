Emergency service personnel have called on communities, especially those in low-lying areas including informal settlements, to monitor water levels and move to higher ground when necessary. The call comes as rain continues to fall across Gauteng. No incidents have been reported in the City of Johannesburg overnight.  However, Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi says they are on high alert. “We’ve got all our disaster management officials and monitoring teams in all our seven regions of the City. We should be able to respond to any emergency which could occur due to this wet weather condition.”  The South African Weather Service says cool weather will continue in KwaZulu-Natal this weekend. Forecaster Ayanda Nsele says light rain can also be expected in some areas. “We have mainly a cool day full clouded day. There was a 30% showers and light rain, but we mainly got it for this morning. For the remainder of the day, it will remain cloudy and cool.”
