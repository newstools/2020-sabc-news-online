Meshoe, who has been in self-isolation since last month, says he is feeling healthy. “I’m feeling very good, I’m feeling very well. I’m healthy and not a single challenge in my body but I’m definitely feeling very good and this is my 21st day since I self-isolated.” Reverend Meshoe spoke to SABC News about his health post-diagnosis of COVID-19.   Meshoe’s Deputy, Steve Swart also tested positive for the virus.
