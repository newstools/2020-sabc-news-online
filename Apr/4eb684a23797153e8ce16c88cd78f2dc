The South African Democratic Teacher’s Union (Sadtu) in the Western Cape says the feeding scheme rolled out at provincial schools on Wednesday, will defeat attempts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The provincial Education Department says it has put aside about R 18 million towards the feeding scheme for the remaining period of lockdown. Sadtu Provincial Secretary, Jonavon Rustin says, “We propose that you could rather use the money available by making food packages for learners through Social Development. Sadtu will volunteer to do the distribution with Social Development, the NGO’s and the churches to make families food packages so that it becomes more sustainable. The plan currently is to feed them two days per week.” In the video below, NGOs say children dependent on school feeding schemes are going to go hungry: SA’s COVID-19 cases rise The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa has increased by 96, bringing the total to 1 845.
