Western Cape Democratic Minister of Transport and Public Works Bonginkosi Madikizela says he’s encouraged by the low traffic volumes on provincial roads. He says it must be an indication that motorists are observing the lockdown. Three people comprising of two drivers and a five-year-old pedestrian have died in separate incidents on the province’s roads this Easter weekend. Madikizela says road fatalities have drastically decreased during a time that is usually the busiest. “The picture looks very different. It shows that there’s a lockdown in the country. We are seeing very few cars and it’s only those people who are providing essential services. I must also add that there are people who are still taking chances who are still on our roads without the necessary permits and we are clamping down on those people.” Easter weekend death toll decreases The Easter weekend road safety death toll has decreased by 48% as compared to last year. The minister says the number of fatalities recorded were 162 as compared to 309 over the same period last year. According to the preliminary report KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape top the list of highest road fatalities. Nzimande says high number of police visibility was one of the factors that contributed to the 2019 low Easter road death toll.
