Freedom Front Plus (FF-Plus) leader Pieter Groenewald says the party will not force its MPs to contribute towards the Solidarity Fund if the beneficiaries are determined using racial criteria. Groenewald says the FF-Plus has already started contributing towards the needy. He says assistance money should be channelled to people who are really needy and skin colour should not be a determinant – during the coronavirus lockdown. “I want to state that the members of the Freedom Front Plus are already contributing to different funds and institutions. But I want to put it very clearly that I will not contribute to any fund or any institution where the distribution will be based on Black Economic Empower. The virus does not distinguish between race. The Freedom Front Plus believes in justice, in fairness and equal rights.”  IFP contributes to Solidarity Fund Meanwhile, Inkantha Freedom (IFP) party has joined a number of  South African donors including political parties to contribute to the COVID-19 Solidarity Fund. The party has pledged R500 000 to the Solidarity Fund over three months which will be sourced from its public representatives according to a story issued on Saturday. “The threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated drastic measures in the form of the National Lockdown to slow down the rate of transmissions and to flatten the curve. This contribution will be sourced from IFP Public Representatives through the Office of the IFP Treasurer-General. Our demonstrations of solidarity need not be monetary but through our small and personal efforts we can all help each other as South Africans,” says IFP president. The party further calls on South Africans to adhere to the rules and regulations of the lockdown.  Below is the full statement on the contribution.
