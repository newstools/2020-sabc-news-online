The Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu will on Sunday visit Empolweni community members in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, who were recently evicted from their homes. The visit to the area will be the Minister’s second in two days. It follows a Friday court ruling that ordered the City of Cape Town to allow the residents to return to the informal settlement and give back their building materials. Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu’s visit to Khayelitsha on Friday:  Temporary shelters made available by Gift of the Givers:  The High Court in Cape Town also ruled that the City of Cape Town stops evictions during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The court’s declaration is in line with government’s lockdown regulations, which prohibit removals. Sisulu has expressed concern over the City of Cape Town’s disregard for the rules. She is also worried about alleged land invaders. “It has also come to our attention that some of our community members are invading land parcels during this time. These actions are de-focussing our attention from saving our nation from the COVID-19 pandemic. We call upon NGOs and community leaders to expose opportunists who seek to take advantage of our vulnerable community members who are in dire need of decent shelter over their heads”, says Sisulu.
