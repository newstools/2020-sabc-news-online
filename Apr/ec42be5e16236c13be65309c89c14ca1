Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, says South Africa has shown some progress in slowing the rate of spread of the coronavirus, but the battle against the disease is far from over. Mkhize was addressing the media in Pietermaritzburg on Friday.   Mkhize says many of the 24 people who have died from the coronavirus also had other underlying conditions such as heart disease, cancers and pneumonia. South Africa has recorded 2003 confirmed cases, Â 410 recoveries and some
73 028 tests were conducted.
