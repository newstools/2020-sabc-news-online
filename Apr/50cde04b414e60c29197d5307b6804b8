Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has attributed a rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the province to their aggressive tracking and tracing system. This after the Western Cape’s total number of cases increased to 1870, with Cape Town accounting for 1500. South Africa has 4996 confirmed coronavirus cases with the death toll standing at 93. There are concerns that outbreaks among essential services workers have contributed towards the Western Cape overtaking Gauteng as the epicentre of South Africa’s COVID-19 pandemic. Winde says they will continue in their aggressive tracking system to trace those who have come into contact with people confirmed to have the virus. “I personally think it is because we very aggressively go out and trace once we have tested the positive. I know one factory where one case had us track and trace and we had 90 cases. In a retail facility, one case turned into 40 cases. At the moment, in Witzenberg linked to the agricultural sector, we have 100 cases. We very aggressively go out there and track and trace which lifts our positive numbers,” says Winde. Witzenberg District One of the hotspots, outside the Cape Metro, the Witzenberg District has been identified as one of the hotspots of the coronavirus in the province. Provincial health authorities are expecting the numbers to increase dramatically in the coming days as they intensify testing.
