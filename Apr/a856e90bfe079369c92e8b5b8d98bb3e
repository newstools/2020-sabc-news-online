The Congress of the People (COPE) is calling on all public representatives, who know they had contact with people who tested positive with the coronavirus (COVID-19), to test for the coronavirus. COPE says this will instill confidence in the public and defeat stigmatisation if public representatives take the lead in testing. So far two Members of Parliament, Kenneth Meshoe and Steve Swart have tested positive after coming into contact with international guests at a religious gathering. The guests tested positive. COPE Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says: “The responsibility of public representatives is to lead by example. All MPs, MPLs, Councillors who know that they were in contact with a person which is now infected by the coronavirus must go for testing. We call upon them to do the right thing. There is no other way. Public representatives can play a big role in encouraging society if people see them taking the lead in testing. Coronavirus is not a joke. All of us must do everything in our power to fight this virus. We can beat it if we are serious in helping this government in fighting coronavirus.” In the video below Rev Kenneth Meshoe confirms that he has tested positive for COVID-19  Vavi also tests positive The General Secretary of trade union federation, SAFTU, Zwelinzima Vavi has tested positive for coronavirus.
