Relatives of a 61-year-old woman and her two grandchildren, who burnt to death when their shack caught fire in Ga-Mamabolo Moshate, outside Polokwane, are struggling to accept their loss. The incident happened on Sunday night when the sisters aged six and ten, were sleeping with their grandmother. Family Spokesperson, Mary Nkwana, has appealed for help to cover some of the funeral costs. She says her sister, who spoke to their mother on the phone before the fire, suspects that a candle caused it. “She says our mother complained that the solar panel was damaged and she was using a candle. My sister told her to put out the candle before sleeping. But it seems mom forgot to do that and the worst part is that the candle was next to a paraffin stove. This is painful and we can’t cope. We are also in need of help to bury them because we are poor, we don’t even have shelter and food. We are grateful for the blankets and sponges donated to us.” A member of the Mamabolo-Mankweng royal house, Lesetja Mamabolo, says they are assisting the bereaved family with funeral arrangements. He, however, says they are encountering some challenges because of strict lockdown regulations related to gatherings. “We are also helping them so that they are able to get donations, especially from the local business people. We made sure that we have got a tent, with the chairs with the maximum of 50 and we also arranged the sanitisers. We are  arranging for them to get things like certificates and the relevant documents. We are also working together with people from the municipality.”
