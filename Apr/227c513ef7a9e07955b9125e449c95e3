British authorities said on Saturday they were clamping down on bogus cures for the coronavirus, which currently has no specific licensed treatment. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was investigating 14 fake or unlicensed products to treat COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. MHRA said it was investigating fake self-testing kits, miracle cures and so-called “antiviral misting sprays”. “There is no medicine licensed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore any claiming to do so are not authorised and have not undergone regulatory approvals required for sale on the UK market.” Scammell added that MHRA was working alongside law enforcement agencies to combat the spread of fake and unlicensed medical products.
