Doctors and health workers criticised the British government on Saturday for suggesting that personal protective equipment (PPE) worn while treating patients infected with coronavirus could be re-used, as supplies run low across the country. Britain is at or near the peak of a health crisis in which more than 15 000 people have died – the fifth highest national death toll of a pandemic linked to at least 150 000 deaths worldwide. Data published on Saturday showed 15464 people have died in British hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus – an increase of 888 in the 24 hours to 1600 GMT on Friday. That increase is higher than recent days, but below the highest daily death toll of 980, seen just over a week ago. The government issued new guidance to hospitals on Friday setting out that alternatives to fluid-repellent full length gowns may need to be used, including reusable gowns or even long sleeved laboratory coats. “This guidance is a further admission of the dire situation that some doctors and healthcare workers continue to find themselves in because of government failings,” said Rob Harwood, chairman of the consultants committee at the British Medical Association. “If it’s being proposed that staff reuse equipment, this must be demonstrably driven by science and the best evidence – rather than availability.” A Department of Health spokesman said the guidance was to ensure that staff knew what to do to minimise risk if shortages did occur, and that the rules remained in line with international standards.
