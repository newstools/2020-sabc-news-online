In his weekly letter to the nation, President Cyril Ramaphosa says through collaboration, the continent will prove that it is more than capable of curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ramaphosa who is also Chair of the African Union, has in his letter from the President’s desk, outlined the continental response to the disease as well as engagements with other countries. He says these are necessary since the coronavirus does not respect borders. With over 7 800 confirmed cases in nearly 50 African countries to date, President Ramaphosa says five regional coronavirus task forces will be set up. These will oversee screening and diagnosis as well as infection prevention and clinical management of infected persons. He says an AUCOVID-19 Response Fund has been established to which $12.5-million has already been committed. Letter from the president: Ramaphosa says he is also working with other world leaders to mobilise test kits, medicines and other personal protection equipment which are in short supply on the continent.
