South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) in North West has condemned vandalism of schools in different parts of the province during the lockdown. 60 schools in the province have been vandalised.  SADTU says the department needs to take appropriate measures before the re-opening of schools. Provincial secretary, Els Themba explains: “We believe that the department should be able to make sure that they are able to put measures in place to make sure that those particular schools prior to the reopening, necessary arrangements are made so that  proper schooling can resume on time when there is a directive when the schools should resume.” The video below, we show burglaries are on the rise at Limpopo schools since the lockdown:   National minister reacts Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, says that she is horrified at the number of schools that have been vandalised and damaged since the nationwide lockdown began.   In the video below, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says they have launched an investigation into the burning of schools in the province.  Motshekga said in a statement that she is working with Police Minister Bheki Cele to get to the bottom of these incidents. She has urged community members to help the police identify the culprits. “These criminals must be reported to the police immediately. Let us work together to safeguard the future of our children by exposing these criminal elements.” Learners from the affected schools could possibly experience delays once schools reopen and the implementation of the curriculum gets underway. Last week, three schools were broken into and learning equipment stolen in KwaZulu-Natal. In the video below, the lack of security is blamed for the torching of schools during the lockdown.
