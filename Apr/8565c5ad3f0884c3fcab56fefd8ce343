Two truck drivers working for South African Breweries have been arrested and liquor worth millions of rands were confiscated in Kagiso in Gauteng’s West Rand. Police arrested the two during lockdown law enforcement operations. Police Spokesperson Themba Maduna says the drivers failed to produce the necessary documents when stopped by officers. “They were transporting liquor from one depot to, we are not sure, to another, but there were no relevant documentation to say we transport liquor from this place to other place. You have to have documentation and receipts. But due to the fact that the issues of liquor have not been tolerated we need to stop them. That is why we are saying, ‘no, this is not right.’ They were not supposed to be transporting liquor at this time.”  All sales of liquor have been suspended since the 21-lockdown was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa about two weeks ago. Two days ago, a supermarket has confirmed a burglary at one of its liquor stores in Langa on the Cape Flats. Police say a 33-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the looting incident. They say a liquor store attached to the supermarket was burgled and liquor looted just after midday on Sunday. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media. An investigation is under way.
