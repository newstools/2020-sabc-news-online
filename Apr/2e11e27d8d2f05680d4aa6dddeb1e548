The Western Cape government says it does not rule out the possibility of cremating people who have died due to the coronavirus, should the need arises. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo says its because of the unique nature of COVID-19. She says cremation are widely used in overseas countries, and added that the contagious nature of the coronavirus, can change funeral traditions. “Of course although in South Africa we don’t have as much compared at this stage international where people are dying in numbers like in the US but they might be a time, as I said we don’t know how the disease will evolve. There might be a time where either cremation or mass burial which we have seen in New York City, but we are not there at that level yet,” explains Mbombo.
