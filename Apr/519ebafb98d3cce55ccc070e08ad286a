Chief Justice, Mogoeng Mogoeng, and Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, have called on South Africans to make any contribution they can to help alleviate the hardships faced by those in need of essentials. In a statement, Mogoeng and Zondo say that they have, independently of each other, identified vulnerable families that they are assisting and will continue to assist during the lockdown period. They are calling on people to assist others while adhering to the lockdown regulations – by sending money to identified families through electronic transfers or arranging to meet at a store with a representative of the identified family to buy basic necessities for them. They say people can also assist by contributing money towards the Solidarity Fund – which has been established by government to mobilize resources from companies, organisations, and individuals to combat the pandemic.
