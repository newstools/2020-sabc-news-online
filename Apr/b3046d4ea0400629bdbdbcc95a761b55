The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) will investigate an information technology tender that the Gauteng e-Government Department allegedly awarded irregularly. Premier David Makhura has requested a probe into this matter. The SIU will send officials to the Premier’s office, to gather information and check the processes that were followed in the awarding of the R30 million tender.   The Gauteng government has been accused of using the coronavirus as the pretext to rush through a big contract without following proper processes. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says, “We have since met as SIU and we immediately agreed as per our legislation to send people on the secondment to go … to the premier’s office and look at this process that were followed.” “We are preparing a proclamation that we are going to send to the President for the president signature. We are at this present moment aware of the urgency of this matter that is why we have dispatched people to go and start looking at the processes that have been followed in this tender,” adds Kganyago.
