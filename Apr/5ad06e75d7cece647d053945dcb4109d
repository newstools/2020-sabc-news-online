The Business Rescue Practitioners of South African Airways (SAA) have tabled a proposal to terminate the employment of SAA workers and offered severance packages at the end of April to the entire staff. According to the proposal, employees will be given severance packages plus a further severance pay calculated at one week’s remuneration per completed year of service. The leaked document contains details of negotiations between SAA business practitioners and unions.  If the proposal goes ahead, some employees will also be entitled to a pro-rated 13th cheque. The severance package will include all pension benefits. Employment of all employees would be terminated by mutual agreement due to the company’s operational requirements on  30 April, 2020. The termination will include all employment contractual obligations, except for those who have to finalise company obligations like intellectual property and trade. Unions and SAA business practitioners say they will not comment as the proposal is yet to be agreed on and finalised.  The move comes after government refused to give the airline a further lifeline of R10 billion. A blow to transformation The African Pilots of South African Airways has written an open letter to the Business Rescue Practitioners, pleading with them not to close down the cash strapped national airline. “Those in the industry know that transformation is almost nonexistent in most flying operations. Currently South African Airways employs just over 600 Pilots and Africans only make up 10% of the Pilot body. Of the 10%, only five are African women. Other South African airlines, including Mango which is state owned, have shown little to no interest in transforming the aviation industry. To us this means that if South African Airways and SAX were to close down, there would never be transformation in our country’s aviation industry. For African children in the next generation, there would be no hope and no future to make in the industry,” reads the statement.
