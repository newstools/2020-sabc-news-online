The City of Cape Town’s Anti Land Invasion Unit and law enforcement agencies have been conducting a number of anti-land invasion operations in Khayelitsha. The City’s mayoral committee member for human settlements, Malusi Booi, says it was done in accordance with a final court order. He says illegally erected and unoccupied structures were being removed. Some video footage is going around social media labeling the operations as ‘evictions’. Booi says this is not so. Booi says during the coronavirus (COVID-19) national lockdown, some people are taking the opportunity to illegally take land which does not belong to them.
