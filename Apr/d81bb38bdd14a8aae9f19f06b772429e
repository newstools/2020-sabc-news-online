Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize has confirmed Limpopo’s first COVID-19 death. The patient died at the Netcare Pholoso Hospital in Polokwane on Wednesday. South Africa’s COVID-19 fatality rate is now at 48.   It is reported that an elderly man has become the first to succumb to the deadly novel coronavirus in Limpopo. The man allegedly went to the Netcare Pholoso’s emergency room where he was admitted on April the 7th. He reportedly had other underlying illnesses. He was then screened and tested for COVID-19, where he was found to be positive. Over 100 health professionals and patients who had come into contact with the deceased have been placed on self-quarantine. In the video below,  Meanwhile, workers union Nehawu has accused Netcare of attempting to conceal that a nurse had tested positive for COVID-19 at the hospital. It is alleged that the nurse and seven other staff members have been quarantined at The Ranch Resort. Nehawu provincial secretary, Jacob Adams says ever since their members informed them of the case, attempts to get confirmation have been futile… ”Which is not confirming or denying but we are quite worried as a union that such a sensitive matter cannot be kept under wraps so that ordinary citizens who are there or even other employees they must be in the know how, particularly on the basis that if they just go in quarantine that be done. But the private hospital is indicating that they are waiting for the minister and the MEC which will only be pronounced tomorrow. We are quite worried.”   In a statement, the Health Ministry says despite the increase in numbers, it is encouraged by the simultaneous increase in the number of patients who have recovered which stand at 903.
