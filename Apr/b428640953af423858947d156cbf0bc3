Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha says they hope to reach about one million households in their COVID-19 screening and testing campaign. He was speaking at the launch of the provincial campaign in Marapong in Lephalale. Limpopo currently has 24 cases of the coronavirus. Mathabatha says 10 000 volunteers, including community health workers and caregivers, will form part of the campaign. “We don’t want to tell our people to test elsewhere because what we want to do is to go to various households, to visit the households. We have about 900 000 households that we want to visit. Because Limpopo has got 1.6 million households, we want to make sure at least a million or 900 000 is visited.” Below is latest stats for COVID-19:  Meanwhile, Limpopo MEC for Transport and Community Safety Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya said on Monday more than 700 people have been arrested for the alleged violation of lockdown regulations during the Easter period in the province.
