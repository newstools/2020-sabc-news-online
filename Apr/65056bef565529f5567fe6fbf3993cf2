The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the extension of the national lockdown by an additional 14 days as a measure to caution and eliminate the spread of COVID-19. This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Thursday that a further lockdown would be necessary: “If we end the lockdown too soon or too abruptly we risk a massive and uncontrollable resurgence of the disease we risk reversing the gains that we have made over the last few weeks and rendering meaningless the great sacrifices that we have all made. Fellow South Africans this evening I stand before you to ask you to endure a little longer.”   The EFF has called on ordinary South Africans to abide by the all lockdown regulations until the rapid spread of the virus has been contained and the risk of further infections eliminated. According to a statement released by the party, it says: “We believe that it should only be a scientific and data based analysis of the spread that should lead to the suspension of the lockdown.” The EFF says whilst they welcome the extension of the lockdown,  they are not convinced  that government  has taken adequate measures  to mitigate against  the economic and subsistence consequences on ordinary people
