The SABC and the Department of Basic Education have announced the launch of a multi-media learner support initiative under the banner: COVID-19 Learner Support.    The initiative is aimed at limiting the impact of the lockdown to the school calendar. It is part of the broader efforts to prevent a total loss of school year since the lockdown was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a measure to combat the spread of coronavirus, known as COVID-19.    The programme is scheduled to start on Thursday and will broadcast across three SABC TV Channels and 13 Radio stations with online support. The series will provide curriculum support lessons to learners in Grades 10, 11 & 12 and Early Childhood Development (ECD). The programme will cover subjects including Maths, Physical Sciences, English, Life Sciences and Accounting.
