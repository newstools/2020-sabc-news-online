South Africa is not looking for COVID-19 funding packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that are accompanied by a structural adjustment programme, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said on Tuesday. “The IMF has released a basic Q&A on the kinds of facilities which are available at IMF,” Mboweni said. “We are not looking for budget support, we would be looking for the COVID-19 specific packages that we can access, and we are talking to them about that.” “We are looking at programmes which would not be accompanied by any structural adjustment programme,” he said. “We know what to do, we know what our structural reform programme is. We will not be looking into that at all.” On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released the World Economic Outlook report, April 2020 titled ‘’The Great Lockdown’’. The release of this report precedes the annual conference of the IMF and World Bank which will take place tomorrow, 15 April 2020. In the video below: IMF’s world economic outlook.
