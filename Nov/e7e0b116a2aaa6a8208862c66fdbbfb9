The tender fraud trial of former Acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and his 11 co-accused has been postponed to November 24 at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court, east of Johannesburg. This is to allow the state time to respond to an application by Phahlane to have the case struck off the roll due to unreasonable delays. The video below is reporting on Phahlane’s arrest:  Phahlane and his co-accused have been charged with fraud, theft, and defeating the ends of justice in relation to an R191 million tender awarded to a private company to install emergency warning lights on police vehicles. Among the accused are General Deliwe De Lange, Major General Nombhuruza Napo, Lieutenant General Ramahlapi Mokwena, Brigadier James Ramanjalum and businessman Vimpie Manthatha. Earlier, Phahlane said unending allegations of corrupt behavior against him were hurting his family.
