The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says there is no reason for former South African Airways board chairperson Dudu Myeni to refuse to answer questions at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Myeni is testifying for the second consecutive day at the Commission. However, she has given little in terms of testimony, failing to answer many questions relating to SAA and exercised her right to remain silent. Myeni claims OUTA and the SAA Pilots’ Association used the Commission’s documents to build a case against her. In an application brought by OUTA in May, the High Court in Pretoria declared Myeni a delinquent director for life and recommended that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) investigate allegations against her. OUTA CEO Wayne Duvenage says the evidence in their case against Myeni, as well as the testimony of witnesses implicating her at the Commission is already in the public domain. In the audio below, Duvenage adds that if she really is innocent, there is no reason for her to refuse to testify:  Zondo cautions against Myeni’s silence Meanwhile, Chairperson of the Commission Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has cautioned Myeni that her decision to refuse to answer questions does not mean no finding will be made about her. Myeni has yet again refused to answer any questions, invoking her right to remain silent. However, Zondo says Myeni’s actions may impact the findings of the Commission in reference to the testimony and evidence of some witnesses who have implicated her. “If a particular person or witness exercises their right not to tell their side of the story, the Commission will have to deal with the matters without the benefit of that witness’s side of the story. And when it makes its report and findings, it will do so only on the basis of the evidence of those who put evidence before it and who answered questions,” says Zondo.
