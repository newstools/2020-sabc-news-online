A 65-year-old man has been murdered during an early morning house robbery in Still Bay in the Southern Cape. The victim’s wife was unharmed. The suspects fled the scene in the deceased’s vehicle, which was later recovered on a farm near the N-2 between Still Bay and Riversdale. Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie says the suspects also made off with an undisclosed amount of cash and valuables. Preliminary information indicates that three (3) unknown male suspects armed with a firearm and sharp objects gained entrance to the residence through a window whose glass they had removed. They then attacked the pair who were asleep in their bedroom. During the attack, they fatally stabbed 65-year-old Johan Ungerer in his neck and tied his wife’s hands behind her back and locked her in a bedroom. The suspects are still at large.
