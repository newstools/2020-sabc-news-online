President of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers Mvuzo Notyesi says Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s decision to act against former President Jacob Zuma is justified. On Monday, Zondo said he would issue another summons for Zuma to appear before the commission and would approach the Constitutional Court for an order to compel Zuma to answer questions. This after Zuma and his legal team left the commission last week after Zondo dismissed the former President’s request for the commission chairperson to recuse himself from hearing Zuma’s testimony. Zondo also said he would lodge a criminal charge with the police against Zuma after he left the commission last week. Zuma has accused Zondo of being biased and said the two shared a close relationship, which Zondo has denied. Notyesi says Zuma must account for acting with such contempt. “That’s a precedent which must be stopped. So, there is nothing to compare here. We must focus on the fact that former president Jacob Zuma walked out of the commission and that is contemptuous behaviour. Let us not look at what is irrelevant, but what is before us today. Let that be dealt with the way it is supposed to be dealt with.” Notyesi on Zuma and Zondo:
