Train services between Mabopane and Saulsville in the Tshwane Metro will resume on Tuesday morning. Metrorail says the Mabopane limited train service will resume operations using diesel locomotives. Gauteng Metrorail Spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng says the trains will not be able to stop at all the stations – including Soshanguve, Kopanong, Wintersnest and Akasiaboom for safety reasons as well as the severe impact of theft and vandalism.
