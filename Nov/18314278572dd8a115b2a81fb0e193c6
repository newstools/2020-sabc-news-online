The Department of Basic Education says it is investigating the origins of the leak of the Mathematics Paper Two exam. The paper was allegedly leaked in the early hours of Monday morning before Grade 12 learners could sit for the exam. It is understood that the leaked material was shared on electronic messaging platforms by learners in Gauteng and Limpopo. Basic Education Department Spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, says it is unclear which province the paper leaked from. “It looks like someone had a hardcopy and took images, very clear images and it was then shared from there, other people received via Whatsapp and it was shared amongst learners who are in Gauteng and it is clear that the other learners were in Limpopo. This does not mean though it leaked from Limpopo or from Gauteng, that is what we are trying to establish,” says Mhlanga. We are very disappointed that the Mathematics Paper II has leaked.
