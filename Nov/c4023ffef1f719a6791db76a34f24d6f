Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says efforts to fight and eliminate malaria have been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. He says the pandemic has complicated issues related to public health in general. Mkhize has been speaking at a SADC Malaria Day webinar under the theme Community Involvement is key to achieving zero malaria. According to the World Health Organisation, malaria cases have decreased globally from 251-million in 2010 to 228-million in 2018. The majority of the cases, 213-million of them, have been recorded in Africa. Mkhize has encouraged those who suspect malaria infection to immediately seek help since the symptoms are similar to COVID-19. “I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify some conflicting messaging in regards to mitigation measures for malaria and COVID-19. Whilst we encourage closing windows at night and the use of fans or air-conditioning for malaria, the opposite is encouraged for COVID-19: that is, to ensure the elimination of COVID-19 particles in the air, we encourage opening windows to allow drafts of fresh air in closed spaces and we totally discourage the use of fans or air-conditioners in enclosed spaces.” Below is the live stream of the SADC Malaria Day webinar:
