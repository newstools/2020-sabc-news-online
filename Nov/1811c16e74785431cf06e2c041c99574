Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) youth members, who have graduated from various tertiary institutions, have accused the Free State government of reneging on its promise to assist them. The party members, who are unemployed, say government promised to absorb them after completing their studies. Some have been studying in China but are back to South Africa in light of the coronavirus pandemic. They say government has stopped funding their studies. Students explain why they are marching:  Itumeleng Letlatsa, who had been studying medicine, says, “Currently the government has suspended our stipends. I have been studying in South Africa online for 9 months already, there has not been financial support.” “I had to buy my own books which on the contract they are accountable [responsible] for that. The government has not complied with our request through e-mails and WhatsApp [but] nothing has been done so far. They are telling [us] that if we are [in] South Africa we can’t be funded … we are just hopeless we don’t know if we are going to graduate,” adds Letlatsa.
