Spokesperson for the Commission for Gender Equality, Javu Baloyi, says it is unconstitutional for women to be forcefully sterilised in South Africa. “This week, the victims of coerced sterilisation met with their legal team led by Advocate Dali Mpofu and Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi and announced that they are taking the matter to court. They described this issue as unconstitutional, inexplicable and outrageous for women to be forcefully sterilised in South Africa for being HIV positive.”
