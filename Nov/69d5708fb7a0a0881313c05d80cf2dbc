A memorial service for UDM deputy national chairperson Mncedisi Filtane will be held at Thanga village in Butterworth in the Eastern Cape on Thursday. Filtane died on Sunday due to COVID-19 related illnesses. He was also a member of the Eastern Cape provincial legislature. Filtane was admitted to hospital last Friday and passed away on Sunday morning. He will be laid to rest this coming Saturday. On Sunday, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa conveyed his condolences to Filtane’s family. “He was admitted to hospital on Friday with low oxygen levels and died (on Sunday) morning. We have lost a gentleman and a father. We are at this time extending our sympathy to his wife, children and family as we gather them in our thoughts and prayers,” said Holomisa. Holomisa speaks to the SABC about Filtane’s passing:  The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape also sent its condolences to the family of Filtane. The ANC described Filtane as an extraordinary servant of the people who advocated multi-party democracy and distinguished himself as an effective opposition leader who was tolerant of other political views. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngukayitobi says the party also sends its condolences to Filtane’s friends and colleagues.
