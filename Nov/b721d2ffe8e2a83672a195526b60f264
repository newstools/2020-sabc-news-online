The case of two Durban Metro Police constables accused of corruption has been remanded to January the 13th next year for further investigation. Jerome Govender and Themba Mbhele appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court on Friday for corruption. They were granted a bail of R1 500 each. It is alleged the two had stopped three men and requested money for what they said was a violation of lockdown regulations. The court heard that those who failed to pay were placed in the back of the van until the money was paid. “They demanded an amount ranging from R500 to R1000 and those who failed to pay were placed in the back of the van until the money was paid. The matter was reported to Chatsworth police and a case of corruption was opened for investigation. The docket was transferred to Provincial Anti-corruption Unit for further investigation. The pair were arrested in the Chatsworth area,” says Police Spokesperson Nqobile Gwala.
