African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee member, Tony Yengeni, says the party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule is being targeted for his stance on radical economic transformation. Yengeni says Magashule’s detractors are hellbent on pushing him out of Luthuli House. Magashule was released on  R200 000 bail in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s court on Friday and will be back in February next year. Some ANC leaders attend court to support Ace Magashule:

He’s among eight people and five companies accused of involvement in the irregular awarding of the R255-million  asbestos roofing assessment and audit tender in 2014 when he was Free State Premier. Yengeni says they will do everything in their power to protect Magashule. “The Secretary-General Ace Magashule was elected in Nasrec, comrade Magashule was not elected by buying delegates at the conference. Comrade Magashule was not elected by buying branches in Nasrec. Comrades we don’t have billions, we have the power of organisation, we got power of unity of our people.” Political analyst Xolani Dube on the Ace Magashule court case
