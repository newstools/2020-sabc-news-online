The  Ebutsini Traditional Authority offices in Enhlaba near Emanzana  in Mpumalanga have been closed. This after some royal family members closed the offices in dispute over the legitimacy of current Chief, Inkosi Teyane Nkosi. They lodged a complaint  with the Nhlapho Commission  a  few years ago questioning his chieftaincy. The group of disgruntled  royal family members  want Peter Nkosi installed as the rightful chief. The  disgruntled royal members spokesperson Mandla Madonsela  says the Mpumalanga government should make a public pronouncement on the Nhlapho Commission findings to put the matter to rest. “It’s been dragging for long there’s letters send back and forth but still the decision is not been taken so  we decided now that we must close the gates, chase everyone and wait for Gogta in Mpumalanga to take a decision.” It started way back, I think he was too young they decided someone must take over  for temporary, this guy decided to take it overboard and too long, he decided not to step down that’s why we are forcing him to step-down.” The provincial  Department of Co-operative governance and Traditional Affairs (GOGTA ) has meanwhile confirmed that it has the report from the Nhlapho Commission. The department says it will table the outcome to the royal family within 14 working days.
