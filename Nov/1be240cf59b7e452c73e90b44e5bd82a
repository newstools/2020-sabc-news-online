In 2015 and 2016 there were also leaks in Limpopo. She has warned that those responsible for the leak will be dealt with severely. “The penalties are just too harsh for young people and we can’t ease these penalties because the integrity of the exam is important. We have to protect the integrity of the exam for everybody else. You can be banned from writing the exams for three years and three years is a long time for a young person. By the time three years pass they are completely disorientated, they’ve gone off the tracks. It’s very serious if you get caught.” Basic Education investigates leak of the matric Maths Paper Two:
