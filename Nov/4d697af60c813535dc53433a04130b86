The South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) has allocated R470 million for Routine Road Maintenance projects across the Northern Cape to assists various contractors. About R235 million will be allocated to small, medium and micro Enterprises. SANRAL Western Region manager, Randall Cable says they met with the Northern Cape Progressive Business Forum, South African Network for Women in Transport and the Frances Baard Business Forum to address their concerns regarding barriers to entry on Sanral projects. Cable says some of the concerns raised include access for women in construction, complex tender documents, and exclusion of SMMEs in economic development opportunities. “Sanral looks after approximately 3 500 kilometres of national roads in the Northern Cape. And over the next three years, we’re looking at spending an excess of R470-million on the routine road maintenance activities.” About 50% is dedicated and allocated to the employment of SMME’s in the Northern Cape. We met recently with the management of the business forums in the northern cape to convey much important information in regards to access opportunities for SMME’s.” In February 2020, SANRAL announced that toll fees on the country’s national roads will increase by just over 4.5%.  The upgrades of the N2 and N3 in KZN form part of the National Government’s key Strategic Integrated Projects, SIP2. The upgrades will include the widening of the N2 and N3 carriageways, with 4 or 5 lanes in each direction and the reconfiguration of most major interchanges. pic.twitter.com/JpaOoh7VJH — SANRAL (@SANRAL_za) November 2, 2020  The tariffs were reported to apply on the N3 toll road between Johannesburg and Durban, on the N4 between the Mozambican border and the Botswana border, as well as on the toll sections of the N1, N2, N17, N12, R30 and R21.
