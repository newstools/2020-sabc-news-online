President Cyril Ramaphosa has wished the matric class of 2020 well for their exams, urging them to summon their courage and strength as they commence writing exams this week. Matrics start their exams on Thursday. In his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa has acknowledged that this year’s matrics have faced unprecedented challenges due to the restrictions imposed by the coronavirus, losing many valuable hours of learning and study. He has reminded them that they not only carry the hopes of their own success into the exam room but that of their families and all South Africans. Ramaphosa says this year’s matrics have had to endure conditions that their predecessor never had to confront. These including accessing and adapting to online learning, racing to finish the curriculum and enduring the mental strain of social isolation. He has lauded the Basic Education Department and educators who went the extra mile in ensuring their learners are prepared to write. Ramaphosa has also thanked businesses, families and ordinary people who provided their support by providing tablets, free e-content and supplementary tutoring to learners. To the Class of 2020, I wish you the very best. You have overcome difficulties that would test the resolve of even the most experienced and hardened adults.https://t.co/lHk66rKfc3 pic.twitter.com/mvhhlhnYE8 — Cyril Ramaphosa  #StaySafe (@CyrilRamaphosa) November 2, 2020  Special Class Earlier, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga also wished the 2020 matriculants well in their exams.
