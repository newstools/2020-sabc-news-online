President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will comment on the US elections once the final results have been tallied. He made these comments during the honorary graduation ceremony of founding NUM President James Motlatsi, the late COSATU President Elijah Barayi and ANC Stalwart Mavuso Msimang. Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden has caused a serious upset for Republican and incumbent President Donald Trump on the college and popular vote. Ramaphosa wouldn’t be drawn on commenting on the drama unfolding in the US. “I haven’t seen the recent; I really haven’t seen. I was watching until the afternoon. I will respond once the results are announced,” Ramaphosa said.

Former President Thabo Mbeki has echoed ANC Stalwart Mavuso Msimang’s sentiments that there are people claiming to be MK veterans marching on South Africa’s streets. “So if we want to hear something about what the MK is, this is where we should come. Like him, I see people marching up and down our streets here wearing uniforms and calling themselves MK. This is not the MK I know and it’s not the MK he knows.” Mbeki, who’s also Unisa’s Chancellor, told the congregation – in jest – that he’d be going on strike because former NUM General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa did not receive his honorary doctorate alongside his comrades, Motlatsi and Barayi. “So I have told the Vice-Chancellor that as effective tomorrow, the Chancellor is on strike until this matter is corrected.” Mbeki says South Africa is going through a difficult period and needs leaders with integrity.
