Gauteng Premier David Makhura says a new Health MEC for the province will be appointed next week. Makhura fired former Health MEC Bandile Masuku last month. This was based on the preliminary findings of an investigation by the Special Investigating Unit into allegations of corruption relating to the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment. Masuku has been accused of influencing the processes that led to the R125 million tender being awarded to Royal Bhaca,  a company owned by Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko’s husband, amaBhaca Chief Thandisizwe Diko. The SIU found that Masuku failed to execute his functions in compliance with the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act. ANC in Gauteng receives report on PPE corruption scandal:  Masuku is challenging this in court. Last month, Masuku’s legal representative, Mojalefa Motalane, filed for an urgent court application in the High Court in Pretoria to have the findings of the SIU report set aside. “What our client is primarily focused on is to set the record straight and to basically dismiss the findings made by the SIU, as I have said they are not factual. It has caused quite considerable damage to his reputation and integrity and the primary purpose of the application is to clarify the wrongful aspects that were made by the SIU,” says Motalane. Meanwhile, Makhura says the cases of corruption under investigation have undermined the progress the department has made. “PPE corruption has undermined public confidence and tough decisions had to be made. When the MEC is appointed, there is a team of experts, public health experts and management specialists who will work with the department to help re-organise the department to deliver health services in an optimal way in the Gauteng province. From December we will have a new MEC for Health.” Gauteng health officials linked to PPE corruption to face criminal charges:
