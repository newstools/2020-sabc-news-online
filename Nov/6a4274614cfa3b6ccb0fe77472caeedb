The case against three police officers accused of killing Eldorado Park teenager, Nathaniel Julies, has been remanded to the 8th of December for further investigation. The Protea Magistrate’s Court on Friday heard that the state is still waiting for the post mortem report. Accused number 3, Foster Netshiongolo, will be back in court on the 1st of December for a formal bail application. He and Simon Ndyalvane participated in today’s court proceedings via an audio-visual link while the other accused, Caylene Whiteboy, did appear in court. Netshiongolwe has been charged with defeating the ends of justice for allegedly concealing evidence. The two other officers have been charged with murder and discharging a firearm in a public space. They allegedly shot and killed Julies, who had Down syndrome, in front of his house in Eldorado Park in the south of Johannesburg in August. The teenager’s mother, Brigette Harris, isn’t happy with the delays in the case. “I’m not doing well, hearing all those things going on. Now it’s the post mortem, tomorrow, it’s another story. For a boy to be brutally killed, this is how they handle the matter. I’m really upset as I am a mother, I’m disappointed. Who are these people delaying these things? What’s going on? Is the system going to fail us again?”
