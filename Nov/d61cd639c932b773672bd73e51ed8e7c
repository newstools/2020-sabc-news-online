Special votes are being cast for by-elections taking place at nine different voting districts in Meadowlands, Soweto, on Tuesday. By-elections take place when a vacancy exists following the death, resignation or expulsion of a ward councillor from a party or municipal council. Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) officials have been conducting home visits on Tuesday. Dressed in protective gear and armed with sanitizers, the officials have been going to various homes to help those who had applied to cast their special votes. Most of those who voted today were the elderly. The officials accompanied by party agents maintained safety protocols required due to COVID-19 restrictions and explained the process thoroughly to the voters who cast their ballot for the party of their choice, in the comfort of their homes. The voters say they want to see a positive change in their wards and effective service delivery.

The commission has registered and approved over 1850 special votes for Wednesday’s by-elections. “We might not be able to meet at 5 o’clock or 6 o’clock home visits on account of the weather. We did not anticipate the rains. We will strive to reach all our voters, all 821 of them, today despite the weather conditions. What we are going to do, we will reinforce by bringing in cars that are able to navigate the unfriendly roads,” says IEC Provincial Electoral Officer, Dr Tumelontle Thiba.
