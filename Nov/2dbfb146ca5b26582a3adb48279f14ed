The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) insists that a report that African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule’s former personal assistant will not testify against him in his fraud, corruption, and money laundering case is inaccurate. The City Press report says it has seen an email between Moroadi Cholota and law enforcement agencies in which she challenges authorities to produce a signed affidavit of her agreeing to be a state witness. The report says Cholota only learned about being a state witness in the case, through the media. However, the NPA says the case should be heard in a court, not through public opinion. NPA spokesperson Sipho Ngwema says the witness has undertaken to testify. “She has made 100% commitment. I think what I must emphasise is that City Press did not speak to the witness. Of course, they selected certain emails that would have taken place between the witness and the NPA. However, we know that we have been speaking to the witness and she is 100% committed and she had undertaken to testify on knowledge of issues around asbestos.”  Meanwhile,  Ace Magashule, says he is ready to face his detractors in court. Magashule is among eight people and five companies that face multiple charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering, which relate to the multimillion-rand asbestos roofing audit contract. He is currently out on R200 000 bail.
