The lawyers for Enlightened Christian Gathering Church leader prophet Shepherd Bushiru and his wife Mary have confirmed that their clients have skipped the country. Bushiri has issued a statement saying he and his wife are already in Malawi and plan to hold a media briefing in due course. The Bushiris were granted R200 000 bail each by the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. Their two co-accused were granted bail of R100 000 and R20 000  each. All the accused are facing fraud, theft and money laundering charges. The briefing is going to be beamed in most of the broadcasting houses, apparently all over the world. Bushiri is under strict bail conditions that only allow him to travel between Rustenburg and Gauteng but it seems that he managed somehow to get onto a plane and go to Malawi.  The issued statement released by Bushuri includes a list of demands to the South African government to say that his and his wife’s safety must be guaranteed. Below is the statement released by Bushiri
