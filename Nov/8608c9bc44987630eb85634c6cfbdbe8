Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says investigations into the death of 13-year-old Keamogetswe Seboko, whose body was found a school hostel swimming pool, have ruled out murder. Seboko’s naked body was discovered at the bottom of the pool at Laerskool Bekker in Magaliesburg on the 15th of January. It’s understood that Keamogetswe had been swimming with around 60 other learners during school hours when he went missing. His body was discovered over half an hour after the rest of the children had left the swimming pool. Lesufi says the investigation, concluded by Ndobela Lamola Attorneys, indicates that the boy is likely to have drowned. He says the Education Department and the school are guilty of negligence. “They couldn’t find any evidence of bullying or murder or someone being responsible. Secondly, they found that from the principal and the four teachers, there were serious inconsistent reports on who was assigned to either monitor the situation or provide support. Based on the footage, they could see that something was not right and therefore they recommend that the principal and the four teachers should be charged. The school is liable. By extension, the department is liable,” says Lesufi. In the video below, Seboko’s family devastated following his death:
