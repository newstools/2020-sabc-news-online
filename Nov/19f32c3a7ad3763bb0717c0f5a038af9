The trial of pastor Timothy Omotoso in the Port Elizabeth High Court has been postponed to Monday morning. It is alleged that a member of the state’s legal team tested positive for the coronavirus, and a colleague is in quarantine. Omotoso and his two co-accused are facing more than 90 sex-related charges. It is alleged that young women from the Jesus Dominion International were lured to a mission house in KwaZulu-Natal where they would have been spiritually educated but instead they were allegedly sexually assaulted and raped. Omotoso bail appeal application:  Last week, Omotoso’s legal team gave reasons for his application to apply for leave to appeal the ruling of Judge, Philip Zilwa, who refused to grant him bail. Omotoso’s legal team argued that Judge Zilwa did not apply his mind to certain aspects of the bail application and that there were irregularities in his ruling. This is the third time Omotoso has tried to get bail since his arrest three years ago. Timothy Omotoso in court for bail application:  Judge Zilwa ruled that Omotoso was a flight risk and that he would possibly interfere with witnesses.
