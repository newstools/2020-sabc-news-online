An application for an urgent interdict to stop the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) from protesting outside Brackenfell High School will be heard today in the High Court in Cape Town. The matter was postponed last week to allow the EFF to make representations. The application has been brought by the school’s governing body. Judge Siraj Desai last week said that the EFF gave an undertaking that it would not disrupt matric exams at the school.

Western Cape education authorities say the event was not organised or funded by the school.
