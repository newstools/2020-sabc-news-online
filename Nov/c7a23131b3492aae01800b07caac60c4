Police Minister Bheki Cele says a comprehensive plan is at an advanced stage of completion to deal with incidents of extortion in Cape Town. He was speaking on the sidelines of an Imbizo in Langa on the Cape Flats. About 18 people were gunned down in separate incidents over the past few weeks. Some of the killings were linked to competition among extortion syndicates. Cele says the plan involves all three spheres of government. “As I speak to you that plan is here, this is a plan that we will be using in the Western Cape, so the plan will be broadened, we will deal with the Western Cape, not just the streets of the CBD, not the townships, it’s a plan that all of us will work on. We’ve agreed that the costing will come from the national, provincial and local government, we hope this plan will work going forward.” #sapsWC Ensuring the safety of the community, operational forces comprising SAPS, Traffic and Law Enforcement were deployed in Langa today ahead of the Minister’s engagement with local residence to increase #PoliceVisibility and conduct vehicle check points in the area.
