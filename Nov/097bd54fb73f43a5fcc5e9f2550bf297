US Presidential candidate Joe Biden has reiterated confidence that he is on track to win the presidential election. Addressing Americans on Wednesday night, he said the American people have once again proved that democracy is the heartbeat of the nation just like it has been for centuries. “If we had any doubts – we shouldn’t any longer. Of a government by and for the people. It’s their will that will determine who will be the president of the United States and their will alone.” The Democratic candidate says it is now clear that they are winning enough states to win 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. “I am not here to declare that we have won but I am here to declare that when the counting is finished we believe that we will be the winners.” Tune in as I address the nation on the state of the race. https://t.co/00QtuYAiI7 — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 4, 2020  He vowed to be a President for all Americans, adding “we the people will not be silenced; we the people we will not be silenced. We will not surrender. My friends I am confident – we will emerge victorious. This victory will not be my victory alone or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people.” Earlier, US President Donald Trump declared victory. “Frankly, we did win,” he told his supporters at the White House.  The Trump campaign is not happy about how things are unfolding at the moment and plans to sue in Michigan and Pennsylvania.  It will also seek a recount in Wisconsin. Over 150 million Americans have voted in the 2020 presidential election. The voter turnout is hailed as the highest in more than a century. Biden is so far leading in the overall Electoral College vote tally. According to Associated Press, the Presidential candidate has so far garnered at least 248 votes with Trump trailing behind at 214.
