Scores of African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League members in the North West have demonstrated outside the Lehurutshe Magistrate’s Court, near Zeerust, where a man appeared briefly. Andile Phiri was arrested last week after allegedly raping and brutally assaulting his 25-year-old partner in Dinokana village and left her for dead. He has been remanded in police custody until his next appearance on the 8th of next month. The league’s provincial secretary Bitsa Lenkopane says, “We are calling upon our own government to start to create a unit that deals specifically with Gender-Based Violence and also to have officials who are well trained in understanding how to collect data, how to put statements, how to guide the victim such that we are not losing cases because of the prima facie of the matter.”
