Beaches in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape have been reopened following coronavirus (COVID-19) -related closure. The metro closed them on Saturday after it withdrew its lifeguards after coronavirus infections were detected among them. “It is important to note that swimming remains a risk as there will be no lifeguards on duty due to the COVID-19 positive cases within the lifeguard staff complement. We advise residents who decide to swim to do so with caution. The City is exploring options to restore normality under the current circumstances,” says Mamela Ndamase, Municipal Spokesperson.  The Department of Health has confirmed that 1 372 more people have tested positive for the coronavirus in South Africa in the latest 24 hour period. This brings the cumulative total number to 737 278. The department says another 20 people have died from COVID-19 related complications – putting the national death toll at 19 809.
