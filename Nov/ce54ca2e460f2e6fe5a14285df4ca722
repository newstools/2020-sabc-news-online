The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Thursday continue to hear evidence related to South African Airways (SAA) from the national carrier’s former Board chairperson Dudu Myeni. On Wednesday, the commission made little progress, despite Myeni’s legal team assuring it that they would not assert a blanket right to silence from their client. Myeni failed to answer many questions related to SAA and exercised her right to remain silent. She told the Commission that she would not answer the questions because she feared prosecution from the National Prosecuting Authority. Myeni claims civil rights group OUTA and the SAA Pilots Association used the Commission’s documents to build a case against her. Frustrated evidence leader of the commission, Kate Hofmyer, continued to ask questions despite not getting any answers. Frustrated evidence leader of the commission, Kate Hofmeyr continued to ask questions despite not getting any answers. “It’s because if they engage in wasteful expenditure then they are misusing public funds aren’t they?” asked Hofmeyr. Myeni responded, “May I not answer to avoid self-incrimination.” “Entities who wasted those funds should pay back the money,” Hofmeyr continued. Again Myeni said, “May I not answer that question in case I incriminate myself.” “Do you believe they should pay back that money because the public has the right to have returned to them what is rightfully theirs?” “May I not answer in case I incriminate myself,” said Myeni.
