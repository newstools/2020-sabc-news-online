The trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso has resumed at the Port Elizabeth High Court. This follows the denial of bail, as well as the dismissal of his application for leave to appeal the judgment by Judge Phillip Zilwa. Pastor Timothy Omotoso denied bail for the third time:  The judge said there was no reasonable prospect that another court would come to a different conclusion. Zilwa said he considered all the old and new facts of the bail application, and the reasons he denied bail still stand.Â He is of the view that there is no prospect of success in another court. Pastor Timothy Omotoso bail appeal application judgment:  Omotoso and two co-accused are facing 90 sex-related charges ranging from human trafficking, rape, racketeering to sexual assault. The case has been ongoing for three and a half years. The legal teams have been behind closed doors to amend the indictment and to scratch the testimonies of previous witnesses. Judge Irma Schoeman will be on the bench and it is likely that the state will call a witness. The case has been delayed several times due to the change in judge and prosecutors, COVID-19 circumstances, three bail applications and appeals, and issues like details in the charge sheet and the jurisdiction of the court.
