Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas says a victory for Joe Biden in the US Presidential election will enhance South Africa’s path to economic recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. He has delivered the online 11th Annual Ahmed Kathrada Lecture under the theme ‘Hope After State Capture – Towards An Agenda for Change.’ The South African economy, which was in recession before the virus hit, has been severely impacted by the pandemic. The Trump administration in the US has repeatedly denied the seriousness of the pandemic even though America has registereded the most cases and COVID-19-related deaths on the globe. Factors that caused SA into economic recession:  Jonas also says Biden will undo the damage done by Trump – including returning the US to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. “The COVID denialism we have witnessed in some parts of the world is not assisting. A Biden victory will go some way towards restoring trade relations. We really need a sustained uptake of Chinese demand for commodities. SA remains dependent on commodities exports as a core source of growth so, sustained Chinese growth is so crucial for South Africa’s economy and the world economy. The world is pivoting toward the necessity of climate change solutions with a new impetus to give substance and resourcing for a global climate change deal. Biden has already promised that the US will rejoin the climate change agreement within days of his victory.” 11th Ahmed Kathrada Foundation Annual Lecture:
