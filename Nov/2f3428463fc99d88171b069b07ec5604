Former US president Barack Obama has extended words of congratulations to fellow Democrat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ ‘historic and decisive victory’ in the US presidential election. On his official Twitter account, Obama says, “I could not be prouder to congratulate our next President, Joe Biden, and our next First Lady, Jill Biden. I also couldn’t be prouder to congratulate Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff for Kamala’s groundbreaking election as our next Vice President.” Obama encouraged Americans to give Biden a chance and lend him their support. “The election results at every level show that the country remains deeply and bitterly divided.” Obama acknowledged that when Biden walks in the White House in January he will “face a series of extraordinary challenges no incoming President ever has – a raging pandemic, an unequal economy and justice system, a democracy at risk, and a climate in peril.” However, he expressed confidence he will be up to the challenge. “I know he’ll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote,” says Obama.
