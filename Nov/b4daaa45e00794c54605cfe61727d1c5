Former President Thabo Mbeki says the reproduction of people like late ANC President Oliver Tambo and late NUM President Elijah Barayi is necessary to overcome the challenges facing the country. He was speaking at the graduation ceremony of three distinguished struggle veteran Eliha Barayi, James Motlatsi and Mavuso Msimang. The three received honorary degrees from the University of South Africa. The event was attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa and Lesotho Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro. Mbeki appealed for the new generation to follow in the footsteps of Dr Barayi. “We are asking for this new generation to follow in the footsteps of Dr Barayi, Dr Motlatsi and Dr Msimang. So when we say it is possible, it is possible to have this kind of person that we are talking about that we need in order to confront these challenges that we have; it is possible to have them because here they are sitting with us. They’ve given us an example, they’ve told us what it is that we need to do in order to produce that kind of cadre. Dr Mavuso gave us a challenge and said that people need to come together in a sense to produce more Oliver Tambos, I think I accept that challenge.” Mbeki weighed in on the criticism of MKMVA members. In October, some of the disgruntled group of former ANC armed wing members marched to the party’s offices in Durban calling for government to improve their living conditions. Their president Kebby Maphatsoe defended the group saying they have the right to wear their regalia. This is despite a resolution to disband MK when its members were integrated into the SANDF in 1991. Mbeki says this is not the MK they know.
