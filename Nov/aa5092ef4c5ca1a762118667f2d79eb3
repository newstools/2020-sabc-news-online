eThekwini City manager Sipho Nzuza, who is among the accused in the multi-million waste removal tender, has been granted special leave. Nzuza’s special leave was approved by the municipality’s Executive Committee. He had asked for the leave after the Durban Magistrate’s Court amended his bail conditions last week. Nzuza was released on R50 000 bail by the Durban Commercial Crimes Court.  The revised conditions prohibit him from participating in the supply chain management processes. eThekwini mayoral spokesperson, Mluleki Mtungwa explains, “We can confirm that the city manager Sipho Nzuza was granted special leave and Mr. Sipho Cele who is currently deputy city manager will be acting city manager during this period.” The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the eThekwini Metro has criticised the manner in which the special leave for Nzuza was approved. DA caucus whip Thabani Mthethwa says Nzuza’s special leave should have been approved by the council and not by the Executive Committee. “We as the DA don’t believe that the process followed in approving the leave of the city manager was the right procuress because as far as we are concerned, only a full council meeting is empowered to make a decision, either to approve the leave and also appoint the acting city manager. So this thing that the Exco is mandated to approve for us is flawed.”
