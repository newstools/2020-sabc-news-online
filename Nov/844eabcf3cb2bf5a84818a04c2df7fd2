John Steenhuisen has been elected the new Democratic Alliance (DA) leader. Steenhuisen emerged victorious at the party’s two-day virtual elective congress attended by over 2 000 of the party’s members. He beat Mbali Ntuli to the post. The DA KwaZulu-Natal Member of the Provincial Legislature is, however, not bitter about it. She has taken to social media to congratulate Steenhuisen. In a Facebook post, Ntuli says: “Congratulations Steenhuisen who has been elected as the new Federal Leader! So proud of the DA today! Now we get to the real work of making sure SA is a prosperous country for us all.” In his acceptance speech, Steenhuisen urged South Africans who are tired of corruption to join the party. A vision for all South Africans! “Together, we must build a new majority in South African politics, with the DA at the heart of governments across the length and breadth of our beautiful country.” – @jsteenhuisen #DACongress#RealHopeAndChangeNow pic.twitter.com/VNMR9UeFLH — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) November 1, 2020  Steenhuisen had been acting in the position since November last year, following Mmusi Maimane’s resignation from the party.
