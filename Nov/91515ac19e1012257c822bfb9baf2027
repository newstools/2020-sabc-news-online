The High Court in Pretoria will on Thursday morning continue to hear evidence from another three police officers in the trial of four men charged with the murder of North West businessman Wandile Bozwana. The officers are expected to testify about the cellphone interaction of the accused as they finalised the planned assassination of Bozwana. Yesterday, the defence concluded cross-examining cellphone expert Warrant Officer Wynand Venter. He testified among others that the accused were instructed through a cellphone conversation to make sure that Bozwana was assassinated. Bozwana was shot multiple times at an intersection in Garsfontein east of Pretoria in October 2015. The accused, Sipho Hudla, Robert Mutapa, Bonginkosi Khumalo and the notorious Mamelodi businessman Vusi Khekhe Mathibela are charged with murder and the attempted murder of Bozwanaâ€™s colleague Mpho Baloyi who escaped with multiple gunshot wounds. They have all pleaded not guilty to charges against them.
