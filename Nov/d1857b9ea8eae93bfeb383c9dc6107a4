The City of Johannesburg is encouraging its residents to get involved in the public participation process of the draft Green Building Policy that is set to expand the city’s environmental initiatives. The city has welcomed the approval of the draft policy that forms part of it’s objective to reduce carbon emissions for all new buildings by 2030. Member of the mayoral committee (MMC) for development planning, Lawrence Khoza, says Johannesburg is a major contributor to the country’s carbon emissions, due to the large economic activity in the city. “Green buildings Policy is an important policy document for us because it deals with one of the worst emitters of greenhouse gases in the City of Johannesburg. As we know, globally buildings contribute about 70% to emissions. This policy is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by regulating new buildings, so in terms of new applications, we are going to look at innovative ways to ensure that new buildings respond to the stipulations in the Green Buildings Policy.” The aim of the Green Building Policy is to actively promote resource-efficient design, construction and operational practices for all new buildings in JHB in order to mitigate the lifecycle impacts of buildings on the environment, while maximising positive social & economic impacts. — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) November 4, 2020  This would be the first decisive step in the direction of changing the development trajectory towards a more sustainable, low-carbon built form. @KhozalLawrence @CoJDevPlanning #GreenUrbanism #COJTownPlanning #WeServeJoburg ^PS — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) November 4, 2020  The public participation process is important, in that it gives members of the public a voice to raise their concerns throughout the policy formulation process. @KhozalLawrence @CoJDevPlanning #GreenUrbanism #COJTownPlanning #WeServeJoburg ^PS — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) November 4, 2020
