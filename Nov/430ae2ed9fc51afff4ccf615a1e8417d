Mhlathuze Water in Richards Bay says for the first time in four years it has received a clean audit from the Auditor-General. The water utility on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast had come under fire in previous years for its poor governance. Last year, its newly appointed board terminated the services of the then chief executive, Sibusiso Makhanya. This after a forensic investigation found that he was allegedly involved in tender irregularities. The current CEO Mthokozisi Duze explains what steps were taken to ensure a clean audit. “The challenges that we faced in the past and everything to do with everything issues of good governance so we had to deal with some of these issues because they are flagged in the audits by the AG that we’ve got to deal with some of these matters as part of our management control I can confirm that the turnaround strategy that we’ve been working on even with the provision of the new board in 2018 continued and the emphasis was on changing things around to get to the audit that is a possibility which is what we are celebrating today.”
