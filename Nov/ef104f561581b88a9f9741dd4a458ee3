The case of a man who is accused of the murder of UJ student, Palesa Modiba, has again been postponed by the High Court in Johannesburg. This after, the accused’s lawyer failed to arrive in court. Mkhwanazi faces charges of murder, robbery with aggravated circumstances, defeating the ends of justice and the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Modiba’s body was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the accused home in Soweto in December 2015. She had been reported missing two years earlier after visiting her friend, Tshidi Mkhwanazi, who is the niece of the accused. Palesa Modiba’s remains handed over to her family:  During last week’s court appearance, Dumisani Mkhwanazi’s lawyer, Dominic Thinani had indicated his intention to withdraw from the case saying he had not been paid. The judge gave Mkhwanazi until Monday to consult with his lawyer. But Mkhwanazi told the court that he did not know where his lawyer was. The niece of the accused – Tshidi Mkhwanazi – who was seated in the public gallery was called to explain. She told the court that she was not able to meet Thinani over the weekend adding that the family had paid him half his legal fees. The visibly annoyed judge asked her to make sure the lawyer will be in court on Wednesday adding that the continuous postponements are unfair to the Modiba family who are seeking closure.
