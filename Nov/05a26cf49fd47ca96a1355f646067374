Worker’s union National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has threatened to remove North West Premier Job Mokgoro’s administration, should it fail to employ community health workers permanently. The union says it will remove Mokgoro just like his predecessor Supra Mahumapelo, two years ago. Nehawu members handed a memorandum of demands to the provincial government in the capital Mahikeng. Nehawu president Mzwandile Makwayiba led the march. “If we deal with the premier of the North West, we must do as we did with Supra Mahumapelo, not because we are a faction, but because Mahumapelo failed to deliver. Therefore, if the current Premier or the current government of North West is failing, then comrades, you must not be sympathetic.” Community Health Workers in North West  have been on strike for three weeks:  Premier Mokgoro says his administration is paying attention to the demands of Nehawu members.  “We are discussing this matter at EXCO and it is being resolved within the national framework. Where I’m at fault and I’m not fit to do the job I’m doing, I would appeal to everybody, don’t destroy any of the assets of the community, they need these. I will leave peacefully.”
