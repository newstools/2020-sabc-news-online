Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko, says the justice system has failed women in South Africa. She says many gender based violence cases are thrown out of court, even though there may be enough evidence to prosecute. Mazibuko held a prayer session against GBV with faith based organisations in Soweto on Sunday. She has called on the Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola to fight for womens rights. “Justice system is forever failing women because cases are still dragging in courts. Some dockets have gone missing. There is a case of a five year old in White City where the prosecutor just said the case is not prosecutable.” “You come across such cases whereby dockets have been closed because the cases are not prosecutable. For example the case of Tshegofatso [Pule] keeps on being postponed and the suspect has been arrested. Why is that they keep on postponing the case … why is the case not ready,” adds Mazibuko. Below is the Presidential dialogue on GBV live stream:  SA faces double pandemic Earlier, speaking in Pretoria as South Africa observes 16 Days of Activism, Deputy President David Mabuza said women continue to face a double pandemic – as they struggle to stay safe from the coronavirus as well as their violent partners. With cases of murder, rape and assault on the rise, activism groups have called on society to actively assist those being abused. “We call for the unity of purpose and commitment in tackling the fight against the twin pandemics; COVID-19 and GBV. We are certain that if we work together as a nation to repair the social fabric of our society, victory is guaranteed. We can now eradicate all these social ills and build a nation that is stronger and united.”
