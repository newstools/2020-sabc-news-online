The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues hearing SAA-related testimony on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day evidence leader of the commission Kate Hofmeyr said former chairperson at SAA Technical Yakhe Kwinana was being dishonest with her evidence to the commission. This emerged after Kwinana denied attending a meeting where she and former board chair Dudu Myeni pressured and demanded former Chief Procurement Officer Dr Masimba Dahwa to agree to award and sign unlawful contracts.
