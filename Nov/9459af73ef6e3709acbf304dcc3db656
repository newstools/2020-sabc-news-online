Botswana’s government has withdrawn charges against the woman who was accused of conspiring with South African businesswoman, Bridgette Motsepe to commit terrorism. Wilhelmina Maswabi was alleged to have worked with Motsepe and former President Ian Khama to cause political unrest in the lead up to the 2019 national elections. Maswabi also faces other charges of illicit financial flows and false declaration of passports. Motsepe and Khama were not formally charged in the matter. This case is centered around Wilhelmina Maswabi who is accused of being a spy and working with Bridgette Motsepe in the conspiracy to block President Mokgweetsi Masisi’s 2019 election. An investigator with Bostwana’s Directorate of Economic Crime and Corruption wrote an affidavit on behalf of Maswabi claiming Motsepe and Ian Khama were responsible for the alleged illicit financial flows. The withdrawal of terrorism charges also means that the accusations aimed at Motsepe now hold little weight. Maswabi has denied all allegations. In August this year, both Motsepe and Khama said they would sue Botswana’s government for defamation but the lawsuit is yet to be filed. Khama says he is pleased. “Personally, I and the other victims of this farce will be instituting the necessary legal action against this regime and elements within it as may be appropriate based on defamation and perjury. Furthermore, it is a clear imperative that we investigate the political motivation of the affidavit.”
