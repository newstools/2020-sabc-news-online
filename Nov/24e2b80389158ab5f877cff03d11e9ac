Outgoing United States President Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has indicated that his client is not yet prepared to concede defeat in the election as top Republicans seek legal options to contest the vote outcome. Giuliani claimed, without evidence, that ballots were tampered with in Pennsylvania; the state that gave President-elect Joe Biden the crucial Electoral College votes necessary to win the White House. Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani disputes election count in Pennsylvania:  Biden, 77, will become the oldest person elected US president as Trump failed to significantly widen his appeal beyond a committed core of rural and working-class white voters who embraced his right-wing populism and “America First” nationalism. President-elect Joe Biden declares it is “time to heal” a deeply divided America:  “You’re also going to find that way across on the other side of the state, there is a similar situation in Pittsburgh involving 300 000 ballots that were uninspected and not reviewed; not observed by a single Republican. There has got to be a pattern. Trump was ahead by two days ago and it disappeared, shew, and we have no way of knowing because we were deprived the right to inspect if a single one of those ballots were legitimate,” says Trump’s lawyer. Trump campaign lawsuits On Saturday, the Trump campaign said it had filed a lawsuit in Arizona, alleging the Southwestern state’s most populous county incorrectly rejected votes cast by some voters in the US presidential race on election day. The lawsuit, which was filed in Superior Court in Maricopa County, said poll workers told some voters to press a button after a machine had detected an “overvote.” The campaign contended that the decision disregarded voters’ choices in those races, saying new voting machines were used on Tuesday. The lawsuit suggested those votes could prove “determinative” in the state’s outcome. – Additional reporting by Reuters.
