A Tshwane Bus Service driver has been hijacked in the Orchards area north of Pretoria allegedly by members of organisations affiliated to the National Taxi Alliance (NTA).  Passenger notice : Please be informed that one of our bus has been highjacked by taxi drivers with the lady driver while on other routes passengers are kicked and forced out of the buses. With this we have to recall all our buses to the depot. @TMPDSafety @Selbybok — Tshwane Bus Service (@Tshwanebus2) November 18, 2020  This comes ahead of a march by taxi operators on Wednesday over the delay in the disbursement of government’s COVID-19 relief fund. The driver managed to flee the scene. The taxi operators will march to the offices of the Department of Transport and the Union Buildings in Pretoria at 10am. In July this year, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula announced that the taxi industry would be allocated more than R1-billion in relief funds. The industry says the drivers have still not received it. In the video below, bus commuters can be seen disembarking from following an instruction by taxi operators. Physically kicking us off Tshwane bus, when buses are on strike taxis operate as normal no one disrupts them kodwa bona manje @Tshwanebus2 @MbalulaFikile #Nationaltaxistrike can we please be protected, or should we accept that taxis govern themselves pic.twitter.com/QSw3TTXF3r — Wandile Masango (@WandileMasango2) November 18, 2020
