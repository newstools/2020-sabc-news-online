Pastor Timothy Omotoso will hear on Wednesday if he will be able to apply for leave to appeal the refusal of bail. Omotoso and two co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are facing charges relating to more than 90 alleged sex crimes. He is also facing human trafficking charges. Omotoso’s co-accused are out on bail of R10 000 each. Judge Phillip Zilwa was due to rule on the matter in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday, but the state provided additional case law which refers to a similar matter where bail was not granted and judge Zilwa wanted to study it. The state has argued Omotoso should not be granted leave to appeal the refusal of bail because he is a flight risk. Defence attorney Peter Daubermann indicated that he will petition the Supreme Court of Appeal if the leave to appeal is not granted.
