British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that he hoped almost all Britons at high risk from COVID would be vaccinated against the disease by Easter. “We should be able to inoculate, I believe on the evidence I’m seeing, the vast majority of the people who need the most protection by Easter,” Johnson told a news conference. Johnson added that England’s tiered system of regional COVID restrictions will also be toughened up when a national lockdown ends on December 2 and some areas will move into a higher alert level than the one they were in before. “I’m sorry to say we expect that more regions will fall, at least temporarily, into higher levels than before,” Johnson said in a statement to Parliament.
