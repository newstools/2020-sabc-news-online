See Live stream below:  ‘Double pandemic’ Earlier, speaking in Pretoria as South Africa observes 16 Days of Activism, Deputy President David Mabuza said women continue to face a double pandemic – as they struggle to stay safe from the coronavirus as well as their violent partners. With cases of murder, rape and assault on the rise, activism groups have called on society to actively assist those being abused. “We call for the unity of purpose and commitment in tackling the fight against the twin pandemics; Covid19 and GBV. We are certain that if we work together as a nation to repair the social fabric of our society, victory is guaranteed. We can now eradicate all these social ills and build a nation that is stronger and united.”
