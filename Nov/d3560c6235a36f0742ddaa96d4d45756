The five men charged with the murder of former Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa are due back in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court east of Johannesburg this morning. Meyiwa was shot dead in October 2014 in Vosloorus while at a party at the home of his girlfriend, singer Kelly Khumalo. The accused were arrested last month. Khumalo’s lawyer has since said the musician has not been formally charged or implicated in Meyiwa’s murder. During the first appearance, soccer fans from across the different clubs in South Africa had gathered. It was very emotional, and they were calling for justice and said they were here to support the Meyiwa family. It remains to be seen if the same support will be shown this morning. It is understood that the case might be postponed for further investigations. SABC News reporter Chrisela Lewis has more:
