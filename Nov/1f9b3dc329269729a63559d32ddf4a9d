Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi, says the cause of the crash is under investigation. “Eight other patients received advanced medical care on scene and they were later transported to various health care facilities for further medical care. At this stage, the cause of the truck accident is still being investigated by the relevant authorities. However, we just want to urge all our motorists to exercise caution as they drive. Keep to the prescribed speed limit so that we can be able to prevent accidents like these one.” In Limpopo, five people were killed in a crash involving two cars and a truck.
