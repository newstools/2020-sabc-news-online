Democratic Alliance (DA) Federal Chair, Helen Zille, has described as preposterous – suggestions made by some members of the public and former DA members, that the party has been captured by conservatives who are opposed to redress. Zille has been elected as the DA’s new Federal Council Chair at the party’s virtual elective congress over the weekend. John Steenhuisen was elected as the new Democratic Alliance leader.

She says, “Obviously they are going to try to present themselves in a good light and try and trash the party for disciplining them for very serious infringements. So the bottom line is this, if I was progressive enough when I was the leader I don’t know why I am not progressive enough as the chair of the federal council to do an administrative job and quite frankly it is preposterous to suggest that the party has been captured by conservatives. What we have done is get the party back as an alternative to the ANC and not a replica of the ANC.” ‘Take power from the State’ Earlier, Steenhuisen said he would focus the party to take power from the State and return it to the people.
