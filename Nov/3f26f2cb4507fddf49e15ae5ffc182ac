The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)  is facing backlash from employees that are challenging the public broadcaster’s intention to retrench 400 permanent workers. Workers from different regions around the country held protests calling for a number of demands to be met, including the cancellation of the section 189 process at the institution. The picket, arranged by the Communication Workers Union (CWU) saw SABC staff from offices in Kimberley, Polokwane, Bhisho, Auckland Park, Pretoria and Durban all took to the streets to make their voices heard, for a second day in a row of picketing. Earlier, the corporation sent out a statement saying they are suspending the process for seven days. Picture gallery below:  Pictures supplied
