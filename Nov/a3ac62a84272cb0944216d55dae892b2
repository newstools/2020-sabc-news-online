The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues hearing testimony related to South African Airways (SAA) on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni asked the Commission not to ask her any questions pertaining to the airline. She says this is because OUTA and the SAA Pilots’ Association used the same commission’s documents to build evidence in the case against her.
