Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says he has decided that the Secretary of the Commission should lay a criminal charge against former President Jacob Zuma with South African Police Service ( SAPS). DCJ says he decided that the Secretary of the commission should lay a criminal charge against Mr. Zuma with South African Police Service. ( SAPS) #StateCaptureInquiry — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) November 23, 2020 Zondo says that the Secretary of the Commission will still issue summons containing the dates at which Zuma will be required to come back and appear before the commission. Zondo’s remarks regarding Zuma at the opening of today’s proceedings:  Zondo says no one is above the law. “Given the seriousness of Mr. Zuma’s conduct and the impact that his conduct may have on the work of the commission and the need to ensure that we give effect to the constitutional provisions that everyone is equal before the law, I have decided to request the Secretary of the Commission to lay a criminal complaint with the South African Police against Mr. Zuma.” The Deputy Chief Justice was responding to the former President’s legal team’s decision to walk out of the commission last week. Zondo’s response comes as calls mount from civil society organisations for him to deal decisively with Zuma. The former President walked out of the commission in Johannesburg in defiance of the summons it had issued against him after he failed in his bid to get Zondo to recuse himself from hearing his testimony.
