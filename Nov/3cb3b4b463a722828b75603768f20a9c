The murder trial of North West businessman, Wandile Bozwana, will resume on the 15th of February next year. The case was postponed after a retired senior police officer Francois Muller concluded his testimony in the High Court in Pretoria. Muller testified about cellphone communication between the four accused, Sipho Hudla, Robert Mutapa, Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela and Bonginkosi Khumalo. Bozwana died in a hail of bullets at the Garsfontein intersection from the N1 North freeway in October 2015. Muller’s testimony follows that of Sergeant Gavin Ndlovu who told the court they seized three cellphones during the arrest of one of the accused. Sipho Hudla and three others have, so far, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder. Muller told the court that during the assessment of cellphone records, it was discovered that there was communication between the accused on the day Bozwana was murdered. The communication, Muller said, shows a trail that followed Bozwana from Sandton City Square Mall, along the highway until Pretoria where he was shot dead. The matter was postponed to next year.
