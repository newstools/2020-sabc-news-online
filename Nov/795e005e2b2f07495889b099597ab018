Preliminary results issued by the IEC in the North West show that the African National Congress (ANC) in the JB Marks local municipality in Potchefstroom has retained two Wards, while the Democratic Alliance (DA) lost one Ward to the Freedom Front Plus in one of the three Wards that were being contested in yesterday’s by-elections. The municipal by-elections were held following the deaths of some councillors. In the Potchefstroom-based JB Marks Municipality, three wards were contested by the ANC, DA, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), FF Plus and an Independent Candidate. A Ward previously belonged to the DA, Ward 5 which is in Potchefstroom town and was regarded as the most hotly contested as all the four main parties gunned for it, was taken by the FF Plus. IEC Provincial Electoral Officer, Dr Tumelontle Thiba, says: “Ward 5 in JB Marks is led by the FFPlus and Ward 9 by the ANC as well as Ward 18. The FF Plus leads by 58.6% and in Ward 9 the ANC leads by 73% and in Ward 18 it leads by 83.82%.” By-Elections 2020 I Voting in Potchefstroom  The FF Plus’ Matthys van Tonder attributed hard work and teamwork to their victory. Van Tonder says, “The FF Plus is a well-weaved team. We are doing very well together, no one is left on their own. We truly are a community of like-minded people and I think we are doing well. This is the fourth one in a row. We are grateful, of course, nothing comes without hard work. So hard work and teamwork keep the spirits.” Coordinator for the ANC Interim Provincial Committee Hlomane Chauke says, “What I say is that it confirms that the people of the North West love the ANC, with all the challenges that we are going through every day. We are determined to make sure that we are side by side with our people and we are happy…” “Going to the local government elections, what is key and what the IPC has been emphasising throughout is service delivery to our people. There must be water, there must be sanitation, there must be houses, there must be roads, there must be job creation and this is a stand that we are taking as part of rebuilding the ANC in the North West,” added Chauke. Meanwhile, the ANC has also retained two wards in Moretele and Rustenburg and won over Madibeng from the DA.  sabcnews.com | SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news 2020 MUNICIPAL BY-ELECTIONS FACT: WARD BY-ELECTIONS "A by-election is an election that takes place in a ward in a municipality between general municipal elections which are held every five years." - Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) 11 NOVEMBER 2020 MUNICIPAL WARD BY-ELECTIONS sabcnews.com | SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news 2020 MUNICIPAL BY-ELECTIONS FACT: WHY VOTE?
