Republican President Donald Trump’s campaign said on Saturday it had filed suit in Arizona, alleging the Southwestern state’s most populous county incorrectly rejected votes cast by some voters in the US presidential race on Election Day. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Maricopa County, said poll workers told some voters to press a button after a machine had detected an “overvote.” The campaign contended that decision disregarded voters’ choices in those races, saying new voting machines were used on Tuesday. The lawsuit suggested those votes could prove “determinative” in the state’s outcome. The Maricopa County Elections Department and a spokesman for the projected winner, Democrat Joe Biden, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Biden, 77, will become the oldest person elected US president as incumbent Donald Trump failed to significantly widen his appeal beyond a committed core of rural and working-class white voters who embraced his right-wing populism and “America First” nationalism. Edison Research and major networks, including CNN and NBC, projected Biden would win more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to emerge victorious in the complex state-by-state system for electing a president, although Trump’s campaign challenged vote counts in the courts and sought a recount in one state. Some have described this as an end to Trump’s tumultuous leadership and an embrace of Biden’s promise of a renewed effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic, fix the economy and heal a divided nation.
