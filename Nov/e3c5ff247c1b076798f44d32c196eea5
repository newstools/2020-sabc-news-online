Former president Jacob Zuma has lodged an application asking for the recusal of the Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo as the chair of the Commission. Zuma believes that there is a level of bias against him and a lack of impartiality. The former president also made it clear that he does not believe the concept of State Capture exists, and that it is a political and not an investigative project. Zuma’s lawyer’s letter to the commission states that Zuma is “of the firm view” that Zondo’s alleged bias against him stems from “personal matters and strained relations that the chairperson ought to have disclosed right at the beginning of the inquiry” Zuma wants Justice Zondo to recuse himself:  However, no evidence is provided of the strained relations, nor of what aspect of Justice Zondo’s and Zuma’s personal dealings could have resulted in bias. The Commission is looking at briefing an outside council to investigate the matter.
