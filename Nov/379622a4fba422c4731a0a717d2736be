Nehawu in Limpopo says it has presented the Hawks with evidence of alleged fraud and corruption relating to tender irregularities against top officials in the Premier’s Office for investigations. The union says a service provider was paid for work which was not carried out. Nehawu Provincial Chairperson, Calvin Tshamano, says they have opened a case against top officials including the premier, because they failed to report corruption and fraud to law enforcement agencies. In the evidence presented to the Hawks, Nehawu alleged that a service provider was paid more than R100 000 for work which was not carried out. They say although the top officials and the premier have the authority to open cases against officials engaged in corruption and fraud, they did not do it. “One of the people we have opened the case against is the Premier. (The) No 1 office in our province has become a haven of corruption,” says Tshamano. Spokesperson for the Limpopo Premier, Willy Masoma, says they will wait to see if there’s a case. However, he says they have not yet received any information regarding the case. “The honourable premier, himself, and the office of the premier is not aware of any case opened against anybody in the office. However, we want to state very clearly that everybody in South Africa is free to launch his or her complaint anywhere. What we can emphasize is that if there’s a case indeed, the proper channels from the law enforcement agencies will need to be unfolded from that.” Municipal workers union, Samwu, opened cases of corruption and fraud against two senior officers at the Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality earlier this week. The Hawks confirmed that they received evidence relating to complaints by Nehawu and Samwu, but they have not yet officially opened a case in the two matters.
