Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu is launching the R128 million Kempton Village Social Housing Project in Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni today. Kempton Village is close to the airport and major business centres, thus contributing to the removal of apartheid area spatial planning, creating a huge advantage for people working in and around the area to access adequate housing within walking distance to work. The project, which is part of the Social Housing Regulatory Authority’s (SHRA) ambitious drive to provide affordable rental housing for the people of South Africa close to amenities, especially in cities and towns whilst contributing to the economic growth of the country, has yielded 312 units made up of different typologies i.e. one, two and studio apartments.

Earlier in the year, Sisulu said that women and children should be accorded preferential treatment when it comes to the allocation of housing and access to water. Sisulu was handing over a consignment of water tanks and temporary mobile show houses to scores of Mamelodi hostel residents in the east of Pretoria. The donation is a joint venture with the Danish government, other government departments, City of Tshwane and Rand Water.
