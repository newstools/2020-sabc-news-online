The National Executive Committee of the ANC, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, will visit the North West on Monday to assess the state of branches and regional structures ahead of the provincial conference. The structures were disbanded in 2018 following the disbandment of the provincial executive committee. A provincial task team led by Premier Job Mokgoro was established soon after, which put together an Interim Provincial Committee (IPC). Co-ordinator of the ANC’s IPC Hlomane Chauke says the ANC top six will be dispatched across North West. “The top six, including members of the NWC, will be dispatched across the province in Bojanala, Ngaka Modiri Molema, Ruth Segomotsi Mompati and Kenneth Kaunda for them to do an assessment and again to give support to the work that the IPC has been doing in the province. You know that the mandate of the IPC is to take the province to the conference.” ANC NEC to assess the state of branches and regions in the North West:  Municipal services across the province are in disarray with more than half of the municipalities in the North West currently under administration. This led the IPC to recall the troika of five municipalities, a decision that did not go down well with others. “It was so vivid in a sense that they gave a report on all local municipalities under Ngaka Modiri Molema district, but they excluded the most corrupt municipality Ngaka Modiri Molema. Now we can no longer afford to have the IPC that is factional and we should say we go the vote of seeing a brighter future in this IPC. In their Modus Operandi, it is clear that they do not want to take us to the conference,” says party member in Ngaka Modiri Molema, Oompie Gotlagomang. The Women’s League also accused the IPC of taking unilateral decisions. The provincial conference of the ANC is expected to be held in January 2021.
