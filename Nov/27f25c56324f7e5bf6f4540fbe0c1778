Environment and Forestry Minister, Barbara Creesy will launch SANParks Week at the West Coast National Park on Sunday. During the week, South Africans will be given an opportunity to get free access to all the country’s 20 national parks. Acting Head of Communications at SANParks, Rey Thakhuli, says the invitation is open until the 20th of this month. “Some national parks will open unit the 22 of November with the exception of bigger parks like Kruger, Table Mountain, Ardo, Galagadi. But the majority of our national parks will open for the entire week. Place such as Boulders which is in the Table mountain national park will not give access for free because it’s an African penguin colony. It’s quite sensitive, we don’t want to put those species under pressure because of scores of people visiting that particular area.”
