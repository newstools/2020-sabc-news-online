Deputy President David Mabuza has urged businesses to assist government in rebuilding the economy. He has outlined government’s plans for promoting small business participation in revitalising township and rural economies. The deputy president has been responding to oral questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), mainly focusing on service delivery. “As guided by the National Development Plan, the government is prorating implementation of programs which target poverty and inequality and contribute to the agenda of growing an inclusive economy. We cannot be socially cohesive while our people reside in areas with minimal opportunities to realise full potential. Our program priorities investing in small and medium business enterprises through increased participation. Small businesses can unlock employment opportunities in townships and rural areas.” Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality service delivery crisis Mabuza says government is urgently attending to the worsening water and electricity crisis in the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in the Free State. He says government is aware that a shortage of water remains a serious challenge in the province and that interventions are being implemented in response to protests by residents. “It’s concerning to us that the service delivery protests in QwaQwa have been going on for a while. We understand the plight faced by the people regarding the recurring challenges in the provision of basic services such as water and electricity. It’s for this reason that Maluti-a-Phofung is among the municipalities that have been identified as service delivery hotspots. It is currently receiving attention through combined efforts by the national and provincial government.” Mabuza answers questions in the NCOP:
