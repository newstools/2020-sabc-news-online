The Western Cape Education Department says its prepared to host the biggest matric class ever to sit for the final exam. Over 95 000 matriculants are scheduled to take the exam in the province. Provincial Minister of Education, Debbie Schafer, says due to the global pandemic the mid-year exam was not written, so more learners will sit for the exam. She says, “We have had to make a lot more plans, we have sourced extra venues, extra invigilators and there is of course a strict safety protocol in place. It’s a huge operation, we have over 2000 markers and 11 marking centres and I really want to say thank you to all our WCED officials and school staff for the excellent preparations that they have made.” Free State Matrics in the Free State are determined to ace their final exams, but they all agree the 2020 academic year was a bumpy one.
