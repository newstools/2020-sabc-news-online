Ivory Coast opposition leader Pascal Affi N’Guessan was arrested on Saturday for creating a rival government after President Alassane Ouattara’s election victory, his wife and a spokesperson said. Ivorian prosecutors are pursuing terrorism charges against more than a dozen opposition leaders who boycotted the 31 October vote in which Ouattara won a third term in office. They also announced they were creating a transitional council. Tensions run high in Ivory Coast following President Alassane Outtara’s re-election:  The standoff has raised fears of protracted instability in the world’s top cocoa producer, whose disputed 2010 presidential election led to a brief civil war. More than 40 people have died in clashes before and since the latest vote. At least five people killed and scores wounded in Ivory Coast election day clashes:  Affi was arrested overnight after the public prosecutor confirmed on Friday that he was being sought by the police, according to his wife, Angeline Kili. A spokesperson for Affi, said on Twitter he was arrested in the south-eastern town of Akoupe. The police were not immediately available for comment. Affi served as prime minister from 2000-2003 under President Laurent Gbagbo.
