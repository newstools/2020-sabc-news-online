On Monday, former SARS boss Tom Moyane will cross-examine Minister Pravin Gordhan when the inquiry into state capture resumes in Johannesburg. Commission chairperson Justice Raymond Zondo granted the former South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner leave to cross-examine Gordhan with conditions last year, after declining his initial request. Moyane will be allowed to question the Public Enterprises Minister on a few issues regarding his 2018 testimony at the commission. Gordhan had accused Moyane of laying a criminal complaint against him in 2016 to further his interests of the state capture agenda. The case against Gordhan related to the establishment of the so-called rogue unit at SARS. The National Prosecuting Authority later withdrew the charges against the Minister. Another former SARS employee and partner at BAIN SA, Athol Williams, is also expected to testify. The commission says proceedings will be held under strict COVID-19 safety protocols. Watch for more:  Call for Ramaphosa to testify at state capture Meanwhile, former chairperson of the General Council of the Bar of South Africa, Vuyani Ngalwana SC, has written to Justice Zondo, requesting that he invites President Cyril Ramaphosa to appear before the State Capture Commission. Ngalwana says the President and other former members of Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet should be called to account on their roles in the alleged corruption and capture of State-Owned Entities (SOEs) that is said to have taken place during what has been termed “the nine wasted years” under the Zuma administration. Ngalwana believes this would prove to South Africans that the serving President is free from the influences of big business.
