The Hawks have arrested nine suspects for alleged fraud and corruption worth R56.4 million in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, in the Eastern Cape. The charges relate to the metro’s 2010 Integrated Public Transport System. The Hawks say amongst the suspects are former officials of the municipality, two influential figures as well as five business people. One suspect who would have been arrested, has recently passed away. They will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate Court today. Hawks spokesperson, Philani Nkwalase, says more arrests will soon follow. “Fifteen suspects are expected to appear in court, that includes their entities as well as the directors of those entities along with municipal officers. You would remember two of them are basically former municipal officials. While others were influential community leaders, of which there were three initially, but one has died recently,” Nkwalase says.
