The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has sent its condolences to the family of the United Democratic Movement (UDM) national deputy chairperson in the province, Mncedisi Filtane. He succumbed to COVID-19 in the early hours of Sunday. The ANC has described Filtane as an extraordinary servant of the people who advocated multi-party democracy and distinguished himself as an effective opposition leader who was tolerant of other political views. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngukayitobi says the party also sends its condolences to Filtane’s friends and colleagues. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa conveyed his condolences to Filtane’s family on Sunday. “He was admitted to hospital on Friday with low oxygen levels and died (on Sunday) morning. We have lost a gentleman and a father. We are at this time extending our sympathy to his wife, children and family as we gather them in our thoughts and prayers.” Tragedy has struck: UDM Deputy Chairperson &MPL, Mncedisi Filtane has passed away this morning due to Covid-19.
