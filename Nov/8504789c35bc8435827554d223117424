The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape is holding its 2020 Provincial Congress on Saturday amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will be a virtual congress and delegates will cast their votes electronically from hybrid venues across the province or from their homes. Three candidates are competing for the position of DA leader in the province for the next three years. Incumbent Bonginkosi Madikizela is up against fellow MPL and DA speaker in the provincial legislature, Masizole Mnqasela and MPL and leader of the DA Women’s Network in the province Wendy Philander. Early in November, political analyst Levy Ndou said John Steenhuisen’s ascendance to the DA’s top job should come as no surprise. “Steenhuisen has been exposed to national politics for some time, he has been the chief whip of the Democratic Alliance in Parliament and he was also given the opportunity to run the party after Mmusi Maimane left the party and that gave him a much better edge. Another factor is that he represents part of the traditional support base of the Democratic Alliance which the DA has been worried about and if you have a leader of Steenhuisen’s calibre, it is possible to still gain the support of the traditional support base.” John Steenhuisen elected as DA’s new leader: Former DA leader, Helen Zille, also emerged victorious as the Federal Council Chair with the three Deputy Federal Chairpersons named as Jacques Smalle, Refiloe Ntsheke and Anton Bredell. The position of Federal Chairperson went to Ivan Meyer, Federal Finance Chairperson is Dion George and the two Deputy Chairpersons of the Federal Council – James Masango and Thomas Walters – were uncontested. Outside the excitement of the leadership race, the party discussed amendments to its constitution and passed several resolutions. National Spokesperson, Solly Malatsi, said different resolutions that deal with different aspects of crime will be sought after.
