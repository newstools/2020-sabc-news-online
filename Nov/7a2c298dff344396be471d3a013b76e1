Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has wished the 2020 matriculants well in their exams. The examinations will start on November 5 and end on December 15. She says 2020 was not a good year for anyone, however the learners must strive to do their best. “I wish them well and they should know that they are a special class. They are a unique class of 2020 where there is Covid. They are a special class, they must focus and do their best. They are not an ordinary class.” Largest public examination Last month, while addressing giving an update on key developments in the basic education sector relating to the Covid-19 level 1 restrictions, Motshekga said the combined examination makes this the largest public examination that has been administered in the country. A total of 1 058 699 candidates will sit for the examinations. “We certainly have never had to manage a number that large before. It is going to be a huge task, but one that we will need to ensure is managed and coordinated smoothly. All examination centres, both public and independent have been audited in preparation for the 2020 combined examination,” She says.
