The three police officers who have been arrested in connection with the killing of 16-year old Nathaniel Julies are expected to appear in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto this morning for a bail application. Simon Ndyalvane and Caylene Whiteboy have been charged with murder and discharging a firearm in a public space. The two allegedly shot and killed Julies who had down syndrome in front of his house in Eldorado Park in the south of Johannesburg in August. Vorster Netshiongolwe has been charged with defeating the ends of justice for allegedly concealing evidence. All three suspects were previously denied bail at the Protea Magistrate’s Court. Whiteboy maintains that she is being framed by her co-accused in the case. In recent appearances, the court heard that Julies was fond of police officers and police vehicles. On the day of his murder, he allegedly approached the officers with a big smile on his face, waving hello. In the video below, emotions ran high during the accused previous court appearance:
