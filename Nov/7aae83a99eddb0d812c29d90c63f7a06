The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says the re-election of Democratic Alliance (DA) Provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela will not heal the deep divisions within the party. ANC leader in the Western Cape Legislature, Cameron Dugmore, has urged Madikizela to use his position to build unity in the province. Dugmore says he believes the allegations of an assassination plot against one of Madikizela’s competitors, Masizole Mnqasela, should not be ignored. “At the same time, we are very clear that the allegations before this conference of assassination plots against the Speaker need to be fully investigated and aired in the public. So the police need to complete their work.  We as the ANC on Monday will move that the legislature must debate this issue as a matter of public importance.” When Bonginkosi Madikizela was re-elected as the DA Western Cape’s provincial leader, he was up against Masizole Mnqasela and Wendy Philander. Delegates elected Jaco Londt as the DA’s provincial chair.

Steenhuisen emerged victorious at the party’s two-day virtual elective congress attended by over 2 000 of the party’s members. He beat Mbali Ntuli to the post. The DA KwaZulu-Natal Member of the Provincial Legislature was, however, not bitter about losing to Steenhuisen. She has took to social media to congratulate Steenhuisen. In a Facebook post, Ntuli says: “Congratulations Steenhuisen who has been elected as the new Federal Leader! So proud of the DA today! Now we get to the real work of making sure SA is a prosperous country for us all.” In his acceptance speech, Steenhuisen urged South Africans, who are tired of corruption, to join the party.
