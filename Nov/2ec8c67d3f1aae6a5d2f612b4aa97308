The Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has expressed dismay after former President Jacob Zuma walks out of the Commission without permission. Zondo says the Commission will reflect on the matter as it’s adjourned for the week. Zuma walks out of Inquiry before he could take the witness stand:  Zuma’s senior counsel, advocate Muzi Sikhakhane earlier informed the Commission that they will excuse themselves from the Commission. “The issue of you becoming a judge in your own matter which on its own is a ground that Mr Zuma mentioned I want to say we have also been instructed to lodge a complaint about you in that regard to the Judicial Service Commission in respect of the issue about which you have made yourself a witness or a judge. So chair I have no other instruction today or anywhere in the future until we have considered the review, except we would like to be excused from these proceedings.” ‘Ruling not a surprise’ Constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos says the ruling by Deputy Chief Justice did not come as a surprise as both the law and the facts were against the former President and his legal team. On Thursday, Zondo dismissed Zuma’s application for his recusal. De Vos has warned that if Zuma excuses himself from the Commission without Zondo’s permission, he could be arrested. In the video below, Constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos responds to Zondo’s ruling:  Ruling on review Sikhakhane has told the Commission’s Chair that they will take the matter upon review.

Sikhakhane has also told Zondo that they will lay a complaint with the Judicial Service Commission. The Commission has adjourned for the week. Below is today’s proceedings:
