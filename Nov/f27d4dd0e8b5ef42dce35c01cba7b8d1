The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume on Monday with the testimony from the former board member of South African Airways (SAA) and Chairperson of South African Airways Technical (SAAT), Yakhe Kwinana. SRS Aviation Director, Sibongile Sambo, previously testified that Kwinana allegedly received R100 million from Chicago-based American aviation company (AAR) to secure a contract with SAA Technical. According to Sambo’s testimony, Kwinana wanted to leave her position as board chairperson of SAAT to get a hold of contracts from the airline. Sambo also explained how she was shortchanged in the tender deal as more BEE partners were brought in to partner with AAR. According to evidence given by acting-head of the department for supply chain management at SAA Technical, Hendrik Human,  International ground handling and cargo company, Swissport South Africa and SAA, had a working relationship without signing a contract. He told Justice Raymond Zondo that SAA failed to sign a contract with Swissport for five years despite the company providing services for the airline. The commission also heard how some senior executives from SAAT were party to corrupt deals in regards to a supply chain tender contract. Previous witnesses on SAA:
