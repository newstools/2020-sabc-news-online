The trial of Dumisani Mkhwananzi, who is accused of murdering UJ student, Palesa Madiba, has been postponed to Tuesday by the High Court in Johannesburg. The defence requested the postponement so that the accused could attend a doctor’s appointment. Mkhwanazi is accused of killing Modiba and burying her remains in the backyard of his Soweto home. He is facing charges including murder and aggravated robbery. Mkhwanazi pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Making a very brief appearance in court, his lawyer Dominic Thinani asked for the matter to be adjourned as he was due to visit a doctor. The trial has been rolled over to Tuesday when a state witness is expected to testify. Mkhwananzi will remain in custody until his next appearance.
