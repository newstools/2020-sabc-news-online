Limpopo police have captured the man who escaped from the Mutale Police Station after stabbing to death a 57-year-old police officer. The suspect had been on the run since Friday. According to police, barely hours after the 22-year-old suspect was brought into the Mutale Police Station on a charge of rape he allegedly killed Warrant Officer Mmbulaheni Mulanduli and escaped from custody. He had been brought into custody after charges of rape, kidnapping and contravening a restraining order were laid against him. Police Spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, says at the time of the arrest the suspect was out on R4 000 bail for a car hijacking charge that was allegedly committed in January. It is believed that on Friday, he attacked officer Mulanduli while he was on a routine patrol of the cells. The suspect then allegedly took safe keys from the Warrant Officer and stole an undisclosed amount of cash before escaping.
