Rape and human traffic accused, pastor Timothy Omotoso will know on Tuesday if his application for leave to appeal has been successful in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. Omotoso’s legal team spent Monday giving reasons for his application to apply for leave to appeal the ruling of Judge, Philip Zilwa, who refused to grant him bail last week. Omotoso’s legal team argued that Judge Zilwa did not apply his mind to certain aspects of the bail application and that there were irregularities in his ruling. This is the third time Omotoso has tried to get bail since his arrest three years ago. Timothy Omotoso in court for bail application:  Judge Zilwa ruled that Omotoso was a flight risk and that he would possibly interfere with witnesses. The pastor and two co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are facing charges related to more than 90 sex crimes and human trafficking. Sulani and Sitho are out on bail of R10 000 each. Omotoso’s criminal trial is also set to start this week.
