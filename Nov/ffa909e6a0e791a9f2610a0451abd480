Accountability Now welcomed a move by the Finance Ministry to give the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture additional funds to complete its work. In his 2020 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in Parliament last week, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced that an additional R63 million has been allocated for the Commission to finalise its investigations and produce a close-out report. In February, the Zondo Commission was granted a 13 month extension to finish its work. Accountability Now Director Paul Hoffman says despite the commission having cost R700 million already, the price tag to uncover corrupt activities is worth it. Hoffman says, “I think it is very much worth it, the rule of law demands accountability. The transparency with which the work of the commission is being done and its responsiveness to the need to deal with the corruption that is being unearthed during the hearings, all of these is a fraction of what has been stolen….” “R700-million is a lot of money but estimates say R1.5 trillion has gone west during the state capture process,” added Hoffman. Meanwhile, the State Capture Commission continues to hear aviation-related evidence from the former Board Member of South African Airways (SAA) and the Chairperson of SAA Technical, Yakhe Kwinana.
