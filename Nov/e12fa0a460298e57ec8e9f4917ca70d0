President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the public and private sectors to work together to complete infrastructure projects. Ramaphosa was opening the Infrastructure South Africa, Project Preparation Event. Speaking in Midrand, Johannesburg, Ramaphosa says the infrastructure sector must ensure that preparation and financing are at the forefront of project planning. “Sometimes when you go around the country you will find projects that have been either stopped or abandoned because there was no proper planning or preparation. It is for that reason that we have brought many of you together, so that we can talk about these things and avoid such challenges in the future. There needs to be more coordinated engagement between government and the private sector when we come to the financing space. Our government is committed to financing the project preparation process.” In the video below, President Ramaphosa opens the ISA Project Preparation Round-Table and Market Place:
