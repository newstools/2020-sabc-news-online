President Cyril Ramaphosa has warned that a resurgence in coronavirus (COVID-19) infections would dramatically reverse the country’s health gains and hamper government’s efforts to implement its economic recovery plan. In his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa says with the festive season approaching, it is more critical than ever to maintain the greatest vigilance to keep the virus at bay. President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged citizens to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 infections by observing the public health guidelines that remain in place. With South Africa moving from a period over the last eight months of relief to save lives and livelihoods to economic recovery he says all must continue to play their part. He says the sacrifices that the country made to contain the spread of the virus in the early days must not be forgotten. A resurgence at any scale will not just dramatically reverse our health gains. It will choke the green shoots of economic recovery that have emerged, and take us back from spring to winter. https://t.co/kqTYUvu2uH pic.twitter.com/RTp5Zpl4b2 — Cyril Ramaphosa  #StaySafe (@CyrilRamaphosa) November 9, 2020  SA’s latest stats below:  A possible second wave of coronavirus cases in South Africa:
