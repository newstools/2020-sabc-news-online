The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has extended the suspension of the Section 189 process for a further 30 days. This will enable consultations with unions and government to continue. “Employees who wish to apply for a voluntary severance package or early retirement may continue to do so during this suspension period. All employees and stakeholders are encouraged to use this time to meaningfully engage with the SABC,” says the corporation in a statement. On Monday, Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahmas met with Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi, the CWU, Bemawu and the SABC board to discuss alternatives to retrenchments. She hailed the talks as positive. SABC Retrenchments | Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams not making an announcement as expected:  SABC employees have been demonstrating outside the public broadcaster’s offices during lunch hour pickets, while workers belonging to the CWU are on strike. Workers picketing outside the SABC‘s headquarters in Auckland Park reacted with anger and disappointment to the news of the 30-day suspension of Section 189. They say the board has failed to demonstrate the leadership required during a crisis, “I’m actually disappointed with Madoda, who hasn’t shown leadership since he’s gotten here. He’s chosen to pocket his R4 million and not come up with a solution,” says one employee. “How the SABC board and the executive is going about the retrenchments … it doesn’t make sense. I mean who gives all employees retrenchment letters and ask them to reapply. So, it’s just about numbers for them they don’t care who does what,” says another SABC employee. Unions remain in talks with SABC management in a bid to find an amicable solution to the crisis. While the talks continue, workers have warned against what they term as “arrogance” by management.
