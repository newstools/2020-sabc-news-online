John Steenhuisen is the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) new leader, after emerging victorious at the party’s virtual elective congress attended by more than 2000 members at the weekend. In his acceptance speech, Steenhuisen said he would focus the party to take power from the State and return it to the people – going on to say South Africa’s incapable State has gotten in the way of citizens getting ahead.
