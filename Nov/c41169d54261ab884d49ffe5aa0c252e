Rand Water has formally informed three of its municipal customers of its intention to reduce water pressure from Monday due to non-payment for services rendered. The Emfuleni Local Municipality in Gauteng as well as the Victor Khanye and the Govan Mbeki Local Municipalities in Mpumalanga will have their water pressure reduced by 20%. Rand Water spokesperson Justice Mohale says the water utility has on many occasions entered into payment agreements with the municipalities, but these have not been honoured. “Emfuleni municipality is in arrears for R994 million, Victor Khanye local municipality is in arrears for R185 million, whereas Govan Mbeki municipality is in arrears for R314 million.” Electricity debt In March, power utility Eskom threatened to cut electricity supply to the Emfuleni Local Municipality due to unpaid debt. Eskom had attached the municipality’s assets because it owed the power utility a R2.3 billion in an electricity bill. Eskom to continue seizure of Emfuleni Local Municipality assets:  Eskom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andre de Ruyter said they, however, agreed to suspend attaching Emfuleni’s assets upon Eskom receiving the R50 million that the municipality has promised to pay. De Ruyter said historical debt does not disappear and needs to be paid. He further said where debt is due to Eskom, they will aggressively go after those who don’t pay because Eskom has lenders knocking on their door.
