Calls to adhere to safety protocols Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has called on residents to remain vigilant and continue to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols, in order to prevent a second wave of infections. The province reached the peak of its first wave of cases in July and case numbers and fatalities have continued to stabilise since then. Winde has urged citizens to make the management of COVID-19 a habit that they continue to practice in their daily lives. Speaking online during his weekly digital media conference, he called on the public to act responsibly in order to avert a second wave, which could result in more deaths and more job losses. “If we know that we are doing the right thing, that we are continuously making management of COVID-19 a habit as something that we do ordinarily, understanding that where we see congestion, we know that that’s a risk. Understanding that if we follow the golden rules and understanding that as citizens and government we have a deal, we’ll work together to make sure that we avert a second wave.” Statistics in the province The Western Cape Department of Health says it has not seen any sharp increases in COVID-19 cases in the province over the last week. Public Health Medicine Specialist at the Department, Professor Mary-Ann Davies, says the province recorded an average of 190 new cases per day over seven days up until Monday. The average for the previous week was around 230 cases per day.
