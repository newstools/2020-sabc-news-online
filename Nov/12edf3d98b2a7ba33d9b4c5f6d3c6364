The ANC in Mpumalanga has rescinded its decision to reinstate a member of the Provincial Executive Committee accused of raping his eight-year-old girls. The former MEC and his stepson, who is also accused of the same offence, are currently out on bail of R20 000. ANC acting provincial secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali says the decision to temporarily suspend the man’s membership was taken during a special Provincial Executive Committee meeting. “We make sure that they follow their cases through and once those processes are concluded by the court of law, then the member can come back, but not forgetting that we have your constitution that is the supreme law of the country, that says people are innocent until proven guilty, so we are allowing members to go through that process but we are saying our members of the ANC that are busy insulting the leadership of the ANC. In terms of the decisions that are communicated, they must refrain in doing that and make sure that the protection and the rights of the kids are  prioritised. ” ANCWL demands member to step down Earlier, the ANC Women’s League demanded that the member of the Mpumalanga Provincial Executive Committee immediately step down from his position or be suspended by the national leadership. The country is currently marking 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence and Femicide. ANC Women’s League Secretary-General Meokgo Matuba says the ANC must lead by example in the fight against GBV and femicide. “Whilst we believe in the principle of innocent until proven guilty, we are demanding answers from the PEC also to engage the leadership of the ANC at NEC level through the office of the secretary-general to definitely give us answers. We feel that South Africa is a war zone for women and therefore his matter must be taken seriously. The alleged perpetrator must step down if he’s not doing that the ANC at the national level must take an action against such member. We are demanding that.”
