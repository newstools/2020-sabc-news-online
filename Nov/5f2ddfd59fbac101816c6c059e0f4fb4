The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament says it is not worried about the upcoming motion of no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa. The motion was brought by the African Transformation Movement (ATM) and is due to be debated on Thursday. The no confidence motion also deals with the CR17 presidential campaign funding. In the video below, ATM wants parliament to debate motion of no confidence in President Ramaphosa:  ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina says the ANC is not at all concerned. “As the ANC caucus, we are looking forward to that motion, let them bring it. ATM has only two seats in Parliament. But our multiparty democracy allows any party to bring any motion in Parliament. We are equal to the task, let them bring it.” “The people of South Africa have shown them that they cannot rule or govern any country hence they have two seats. Let them come with that lousy motion. The ANC is ready, that is the work of the opposition,” adds Majodina. Earlier, ATM said it would engage with the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, to request that in the spirit of true democracy the vote of no confidence be done by a secret ballot. Party spokesperson S’busiso Mncwabe says they have garnered a lot of support from other parties and they have confidence their motion will pass. “Immediately when we put the motion that time we started engaging our fellow opposition colleagues in the benches, in Parliament to make sure that we got the support. Even today, as soon as we learnt that our motion has been put in the order paper for next week, we mandated the leader of the movement, the president of the ATM to start also going through the negotiations with our colleagues. What we want most is to strengthen our backing, we must go for a secret ballot. We might shock the nation come next week,” says Mncwabe.
