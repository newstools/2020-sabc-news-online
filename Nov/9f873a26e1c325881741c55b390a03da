The sole Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) MP who had his membership revoked by Parliament, Mzwanele Nyhontso says he will urgently challenge the Speaker’s decision in court. On Saturday, National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise said she was forced by law to remove him as an MP. Parliament’s Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said, “She has just acted according to the Constitution by effecting that party’s decision to change its representation in parliament by removing its sole MP Mr Nyhontso. He adds, “While some within the PAC have sought to question the Speaker’s action and her integrity in this matter which is unfortunate, the Speaker has acted fairly with impartiality and what is required under the law and refusing to get involved in the internal battles within the PAC.” But Nyhontso says the Speaker acted irrationally. His spokesperson, Jaki Seroke explains, “The Speaker has acted on the basis of tissues of lies and this is unfair for her to have done that without even consulting and responding from letters coming from our legal representatives. The Speaker is obviously prejudiced against the PAC, and we think this is unfair. We will take the matter to the Western Cape High Court and sue, and have an interdict against the speaker and parliament.”
