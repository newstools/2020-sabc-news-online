State House has brushed aside allegations that Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary, came on the same flight with President Lazarus Chakwera from South Africa on Friday evening. Bushiri, who is on bail in South Africa, returned to Malawi on Friday night in what he has described as a tactical withdrawal. The couple’s lawyer, Terrence Baloyi confirmed their departure. ECG lawyer confirms Shepherd Bushiri and his wife are in Malawi:  Social media reports had earlier speculated that Bushiri might have returned home on the same flight with Chakwera. State House Press Secretary, Brian Banda, on Saturday afternoon described the allegations as false. He also said Chakwera and his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, did not discuss the issue of Bushiri during their meeting in Pretoria on Friday. “The topics of discussion between President Lazarus Chakwera, President Cyril Ramaphosa, and their delegations were highlighted by the two leaders during their joint press briefing,” Banda said. Bushiri was scheduled to address the media on Saturday afternoon. The media briefing has since been postponed.

Bushiri says he wants a fair trial:  The Bushiri’s were restricted to North West and Gauteng and had to hand in their travelling documents and the title deeds to all their properties. Their movements were supposed to be confined to the Gauteng and North West provinces, where they operate numerous church branches and businesses.
