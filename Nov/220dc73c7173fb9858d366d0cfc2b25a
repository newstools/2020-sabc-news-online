The power utility said its unsustainable debt burden led to net finance cost of R31.2 billion, which resulted in a net loss of R20.5 billion. Eskom also revealed that the country’s municipal debt has gone to more than R28 billion. The power utility’s Chief Executive Officer Andre de Ruyter said Eskom needs to reduce its debt levels to restore financial sustainability. “We also had some significant issues relating to the global economic environment relating to the sovereign credit downgrade all against the backdrop of COVID-19. So it was a challenging time, all these happening at the same time but is not all doom and gloom, we are making good progress.” Eskom Annual Results media briefing:
