The party has called for Mayor Dan Plato, Mayco Member, JP Smith and Metro Police Head, Robbie Roberts, to step down. ANC Caucus Spokesperson Fiona Abrahams says: “We are shocked by this cruelty which reminds us of the human rights abuses of the apartheid police. We have seen other examples of this callousness from the Metro Police, which is led by a person who cut his teeth in the old police force. We all do we remember the undercover police officer who was shot and killed in Long Street, as well as the naked man who was turfed out of his shack. Just like the apartheid police, the Metro Police behaves with impunity.”
