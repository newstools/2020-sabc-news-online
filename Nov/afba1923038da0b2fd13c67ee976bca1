DA Gauteng MPL Fred Nel has been elected provincial chairperson and his deputy is Bongani Nkomo. Msimanga says he wants to be a leader for all members and not for a faction. He was delivering his acceptance speech after his election. Your new DA Gauteng leadership!

He says it is important for the DA to unite because voters don’t want to support a divided Democratic Alliance. Msimanga says the DA must be the champion of service delivery in Gauteng. “Real change for our people will only happen when we, as the Democratic Alliance, stand firm and focus on our values, principles and policies. Real change will only happen when we are part of the people’s daily lives and experiences. We have to connect with every resident of this province who share our value but are not yet voting for us.” Setting Tshwane on the right path Earlier, DA Federal leader John Steenhuisen said the party will again set the City of Tshwane on the right path. He further said the DA-run Midvaal Municipality is an example of good governance. “What we also need to tell voters is that the reason why Johannesburg and Tshwane were allowed to be stolen back after DA had made progress since 2016, is because our majority was not strong. The same thing happened in Nelson Mandela Bay. We did well enough in 2016 to put DA run in place but not 100% safe. One thing we know about the ANC is that they will force their way back to the feeding through if you leave the door open, just a tiny crack.”
