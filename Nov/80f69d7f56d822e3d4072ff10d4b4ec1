Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the swift response of KwaZulu-Natal authorities with an investigation into Monday night’s crash on the N3 near Estcourt, in the Midlands. Fourteen people were killed in the crash involving two trucks and a taxi. Preliminary reports suggest that the taxi was travelling between the trucks when the truck in front jack-knifed. Spokesperson Ayanda Allie Paine explains: “Well it’s absolutely important to get to the bottom of the factors that contributed to this tragic loss of life. Not only for the sake of closure for those who have lost their loved ones but also as a way of preventing similar carnage in future. Investigations into the cause of this crash will focus on the roadworthiness of all the vehicles involved and the weather conditions at the time of the accident as well as other causal factors that could have led to this collision.”
