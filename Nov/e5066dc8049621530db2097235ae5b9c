The ANC Inter-Provincial Committee (IPC) in the North West has taken a decision to oust the Mahikeng Local Municipality mayor, speaker as well as the chief whip. This follows the passing of a motion of no confidence against councilors that are in defiance of the party mandate’s to resign. Chairperson of the IPC Hlomane Chauke says disciplinary action will be instituted against those that are defying the organisation and their membership will be temporarily suspended. “The party has, therefore, resolved to go to the IEC and reclaim its seats from those three comrades which the party has already communicated with the IEC to remove now as councilors. They are representing the ANC and we are taking that the sooner the IEC finalises that process and communicates to the municipal manager and he will then immediately, without waste of time, declare vacancies and then will enable the party to fill up those vacancies.”
