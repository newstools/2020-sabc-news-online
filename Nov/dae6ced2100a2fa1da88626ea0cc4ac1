Head of AfriForum’s private prosecutions wing Advocate Gerrie Nel says he will be disappointed if the mastermind in the murder of former Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa will not be brought to the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court east of Johannesburg on Friday. The five men already arrested in connection with the murder will appear in court on Friday. Meyiwa was shot dead in October 2014 in Vosloorus while at a party at the home of his girlfriend, singer Kelly Khumalo. The accused were arrested last month. Advocate Nel says police investigations have been concluded. “I had a meeting with the police management, a discussion with the NPA. What I can reveal is that as far as I’m concerned, the police have finalised the investigation. What I can also add is that I know that there are even more of a stronger case against whoever the mastermind is, so I will be surprised if the mastermind is not here.” SABC’s Chriselda Lewis interviews Nel before court proceeding: Document Last month, a document in the murder case of Meyiwa revealed that authorities are zoning in on his girlfriend, Kelly Khumalo. Erroneously sent to the media by the NPA, it shows how investigators have asked for Khumalo’s cellphone communication with accused number five, Sifokuhle Ntuli. Ntuli and four others appeared in the Boksburg Magistrates’ Court for their alleged involvement in Meyiwa’s 2014 murder. They face charges of murder, attempted murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Documents in Meyiwa case:
