The secretary general stated on more than one occasion, including through his legal team, that he would cooperate with any process undertaken by law enforcement agencies. The ANC will be monitoring these developments closely and will accordingly communicate on any update should the need arise,” says Mabe. Magashule is expected to hand himself over to authorities ahead of his appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Friday. The Hawks confirmed Tuesday afternoon that a warrant of arrest has been issued for Magashule for his alleged role in the awarding of the 255 million rand asbestos audit tender. Magashule says he is not aware of a warrant of arrest issued for him: Both the Auditor-General and the Public Protector declared as irregular the procurement of the 2014 contract to assess and eradicate asbestos roofs in the Free State. Public Protector found that only R21 million was spent on the actual audit of asbestos roofs in the Free State.
