The Professional Educators Union says it is concerned that the Limpopo province is once again implicated in an exam cheating scandal. In 2015 some learners in the province had access to a Life Science question paper. A Maths question paper also leaked in 2016. The Basic Education Department says it is now investigating the origins of the leak of the Maths Paper Two this year, after learners in Limpopo and Gauteng accessed the paper on WhatsApp before the exam. The Union’s president Johannes Motona: “This misdemeanor is always happening in this province, Limpopo, which seems to be a trend and it puts really the integrity of the question papers in question, more particular the results when they shall be issued. It is about time that the Department of Basic Education and quality assurer UMALUSI, in particular, take we really have more question than answers, austerity actions against all these departmental officials who are involved and the learners.” Basic Education investigates leak in the matric Maths Paper Two

Meanwhile, the secretary of the Congress of South African Students in Limpopo Skhalo Mahladisa says they were not surprised by the recent leak. “We are not surprised nor flabbergasted because we have always been experiencing this problem in the province of the north where a paper leaks and the department speaks English that they are going to investigate. They will conduct investigations and then after we don’t even know the outcomes of these investigations. There has not been even a single person that was held accountable for the past few years.”
