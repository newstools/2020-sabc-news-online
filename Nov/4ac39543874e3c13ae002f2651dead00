South Africa will this week focus on the scourge of Gender-Based-Violence when the annual 16 Days of Activism campaign kicks off. Pre-empting the national campaign, the community of Duncan village in East London took to the streets to demand justice for victims. This is in the wake of the alleged rape of a 14-year-old boy by a 74-year-old man. March organiser, Phumeza Kwababa, says violence against women and children must stop. “In our community, we have had almost five LGBTQI that were murdered by one of the community members. So we realise that the community of Duncan village needs to be sensitised against LGBTQI; they need to understand that being gay and lesbian is not a sin because most of the people think that a gay child is not a child.” An activist against Gender-Based Violence, Dr Lesley Ann-Foster from the Masinyamanye Women’s Rights International Organisation, says all communities must tackle the issue head-on. “I think it is very inspiring that communities are engaged in issues of Gender-Based-Violence and that they are actually prepared to stand up courageously against violence in their communities. They’re taking responsibility and that’s a very important part of our struggle.” The community of Duncan Village in East London takes to the streets demanding justice for Gender-Based Violence victims:  – Additional reporting by Amanda Xhala.
