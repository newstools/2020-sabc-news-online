Former Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, was the 10th suspect in the Hawks’ sights in the latest arrests for fraud and corruption. Nine people handed themselves over to the police this morning in connection with fraud and corruption allegations worth R56.4 million in the metro. They appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court and were granted bail ranging from R5 000 to R100 000. Among the suspects charged today are Nadia Gerwel and Andrea Wessels, who are facing similar charges in a related case for which they are currently out on bail. Others are an ANC PEC member, Zandisile Qupe, and a former deputy mayor of the city, Chippa Ngcolomba. The matter has been postponed to 12 March 2021. The alleged crime dates back to 2010 and is linked to the integrated public transport system and other projects. Bobani was laid to rest this morning. He passed on last week from COVID-19 complications. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa pays tribute to Bobani at his funeral service:  Bobani was kicked out of office last year following a vote of no confidence in him. It had been tabled by the Democratic Alliance (DA). He had ascended to the mayoral position in 2018 after Athol Trollip was removed from the post.
