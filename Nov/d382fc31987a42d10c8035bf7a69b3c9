ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has handed himself over to the Hawks ahead of his appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court in the Free State on Friday morning. His appearance is in connection with the controversial R255 million asbestos audit. Former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo is among supporters of Magashule who have gathered outside court. Some of his supporters have reiterated their allegation that law enforcement agencies are being used to fight political battles. ANC Chief Whip in the provincial legislature, Vusi Tshabalala, says what is happening to Magashule is similar to what happened to former ANC president Jacob Zuma. “We are not happy as members of the branches of the ANC where we see that the institutions, which are Chapter 9 institutions, are being used to deal with political matters. I can tell you now what happened prior 2007 where we took decisions where Jacob Zuma, the President at that time, was also been attacked the same way that we see today. While we will respect the Constitution of this country, we will definitely show that respect because until proven guilty then we will talk something. But for now, we are behind the Secretary-General of the ANC.” Ace Magashule to appear in court:  Tight security Security has been tightened and roads cordoned off around the court ahead of Magashule’s appearance. Mangaung Metro’s Qondile Khedama says, “One of the streets that is going to be affected is President Road. You know it is one of the busiest streets because of the Central University of Technology. We have informed the public that there are a few roads that would be closed. The intention is to also respect members of the community. We have to respect democracy and ensure that all citizens are treated equally. They cannot be inconvenienced or not be informed simply because there are activities that are taking place this morning here.” Tensions rising between groups for and against Ace Magashule:
