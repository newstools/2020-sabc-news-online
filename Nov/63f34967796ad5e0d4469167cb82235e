The African National Congress(ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule has again highlighted the importance of unity in the governing party. He was speaking in an exclusive interview with the SABC on Wednesday night. After taking the reigns as party president, Cyril Ramaphosa called for unity. But this has proved to be elusive with some party members speaking out of turf with the leadership. Magashule, who is also facing criminal charges over his alleged involvement in the Vrede Dairy Farm Project, had to reprimand his supporters who were seen burning ANC t-shirts bearing the face of the president outside the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court in the Free State last week. ANC secretary-general granted R200 000 bail:  He says the party considers unity to be paramount. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule speaks to SABC:  Speaking in an exclusive interview with the SABC, Magashule has also expressed disappointment at the perceived arrogance of the SABC board to continue with the retrenchment process at the public broadcaster. He says the ANC is monitoring developments and is engaging with Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams as she handles the matter. “As the ANC, we have our deployee, the Minister of Communications. We have engaged with her and I know that she’s very clear there is no need for retrenchments at the SABC and I don’t know why some board members are so intransigent and I think they show some arrogance. I don’t know why they are so arrogant. It’s clear what they want to do is to commercialise, privatise SABC which is against the ANC position.” Ndabeni-Abrahams has called for calm while her department intervenes in the SABC‘s intention to retrench about 400 permanent staff by the end of the year.
