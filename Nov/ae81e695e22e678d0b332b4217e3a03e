The trial of the four accused charged with the murder of North West businessman Wandile Bozwana has resumed in the High Court in Pretoria following a three-month break. The accused Sipho Hudla, Robert Mutapa, Bonginkosi Khumalo, and the notorious Mamelodi businessman Vusi ‘Khekhe’ Mathibela are charged with murder and attempted murder of Bozwana’s co-worker Mpho Baloyi five years ago. Baloyi escaped with serious gunshot injuries. Bozwana died in a hail of bullets on the Garsfontein off-ramp east of Pretoria in October 2015. Bozwana laid to rest:  His co-worker Mpho Baloyi escaped with multiple bullet wounds. They were ambushed by a group of heavily armed men who allegedly followed them from the Sandton Square where Bozwana went to do his hair. Cellphone expert testifies State witness Warrant Officer Wynand Venter, who is a cellphone expert from the South African Police Service gave evidence. Venter has been asked to clarify the cellphone communication of the accused on the day of Bozwana’s assassination. He testified that expert investigations revealed that a variety of cellphone brands were detected as being used by the accused on the day of the commission of the crime. He has been cross-examined by the defense, amid the presence of heavily armed police inside and outside the courtroom. According to the evidence before the court, the accused received instructions in one of the cellphones as they were following Bozwana’s vehicle to Pretoria. They were ordered to ensure the job was carried out as planned on that particular day. Moments later, Bozwana and co-worker, Baloyi who was the driver of Bozwana’s vehicle at the time, were cornered at an intersection in Garsfontein. They were shot multiple times in broad daylight. It was on a Friday afternoon. Bozwana succumbed to gunshot injuries in hospital hours later. The four accused have all pleaded not guilty to the charges of murder and attempted murder.
