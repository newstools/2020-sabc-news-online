US Presidential hopeful Joe Biden has appealed for calm as Americans wait anxiously for the election results. Addressing Americans on Thursday, Biden called for each ballot to be counted amid allegations of vote fraud. The Trump campaign filed several lawsuits in key states vital to the President’s re-election. However, Biden seems unshaken. He has again urged patience as counting continues. “Democracy is sometimes messy; sometimes it requires a little patience. But that patience has been rewarded for more than 240 years with a system of governance that has been the envy of the world.” Biden says he has no doubt that when the counting is finished, “Senator Harris and I will be declared the winners.” He urged Americans to remain calm. “The process is working. The count is being complemented and we will know very soon.” Biden says he and his vice president elect Kamala Harris spent Thursday afternoon attending briefings on COVID-19 and America’s economic crisis. Biden says the briefing reminded him of the severity of the disease. “Our hearts go out to each and every family that lost their loved one to this terrible disease.” More than nine million Americans have contracted COVID-19 and more than 230 000 deaths have been reported. Biden seems poised to become the 46th President of the United States of America as he continues to hold a lead against President Donald Trump.
