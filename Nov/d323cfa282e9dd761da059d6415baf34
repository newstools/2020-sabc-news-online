The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) is urging its members at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) not to go on strike on Friday. The union says it has opted to approach the labour court to halt the retrenchments at the public broadcaster. It says this is preventing its members to go on strike but can only join pickets at lunchtime. The hearing has been set for next week Friday at the Labour Court. “We have opted to interdict the SABC in the Labour Court. The law says we can not embark on the strike. Actually, if Bemawu members do participate in the strike it would still be protected for them but they may lose their right to challenge the unfair retrenchment in the Labour Court. So our advice to our members is to fully support the strike and we fully support the strike to participate in all the lunchtime pickets but not to participate in the strike for now as we are heading for the Labour Court,” says Bemawu president, Hannes du Buisson. Bemawu members advised not to strike:  CWU forges ahead with Friday’s strike Meanwhile, the CWU is threatening a complete blackout at the SABC from Friday afternoon The union has also called on the board and executive management to step down, saying they’ve failed to turn the organisation around. SABC employees picket against retrenchments Scores of SABC staffers picketed countrywide against the retrenchments at the public broadcaster. Management says the retrenchments are necessary because of the current financial crisis at the corporation. GALLERY | SABC staff embark on countrywide lunchtime picket      “
