Former Treasurer at Airports Company (ACSA) Phetolo Ramosebudi has refused to answer questions, at the State Capture Commission, regarding invoices he made to Regiments Capital requesting nearly half a million in payments for work he claimed to have done for Regiments in his personal capacity. Earlier Ramosebudi conceded that he was the only person aware that Gupta-linked Regiments Capital would receive an irregular payment of R22-million for a financial instruments transaction between Standard Bank and ACSA. Below is an abstract of the Commission’s questions to Ramosebudi: Q: “Do you recall sending this invoice to Regiments Capital?” A: “I can’t recall Chairperson.” Q: “Do you recall doing any actuarial and risk management consulting on behalf of Regiments Capital?” A: “Chairperson, I’ve been advised by my lawyers not to respond on this one in case I incriminate myself.” Ramosebudi worked for a number of state-owned entities including SAA, ACSA and Transnet.
