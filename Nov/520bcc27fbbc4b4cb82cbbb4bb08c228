During a dialogue at the OR Tambo School’s Umrabulo Dialogue Reverend Frank Chikane said the South African Constitution was designed to give people power to achieve the national strategic objective of changing the painful history of our country. Chikane says the diversion of that power to individuals is what has caused pain to South Africa, adding, ‘We are not the society we struggled for’. The event was to address whether the country’s Constitution has managed to drive South Africa’s transformation efforts. Rev Chikane is a political activist, former General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, former director-general in the presidency and an author. Rev.
