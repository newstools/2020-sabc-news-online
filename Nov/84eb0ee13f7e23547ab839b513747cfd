The trial of pastor Timothy Omotoso has been postponed to January the 26th of next year in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. The postponement follows the death of advocate Zukile Mdolombo, who was part of the state’s legal team. Advocate Mdolomba successfully opposed Omotoso’s bail application in the High Court in Port Elizabeth a few weeks ago. He was one of the three prosecutors in the rape and human trafficking case against Omotoso. The clerk of the court has also tested positive for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Judge Irma Schoeman dismissed the application from the defense to have the evidence of two witnesses declared inadmissible. Omotoso and two co-accused are facing more than 90 sex-related charges. Omotoso’s bail appeal application judgment  Last week, Omotoso’s legal team gave reasons for his application to apply for leave to appeal the ruling of Judge, Philip Zilwa, who refused to grant him bail. Omotoso’s legal team argued that Judge Zilwa did not apply his mind to certain aspects of the bail application and that there were irregularities in his ruling. This was the third time Omotoso has tried to get bail since his arrest three years ago.
