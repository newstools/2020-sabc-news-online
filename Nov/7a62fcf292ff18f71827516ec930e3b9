The lawyer of self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary has confirmed that their clients have handed themselves over to the police in Lilongwe, Malawi. Terrence Baloyi says this is part of the couple’s plan as Bushiri announced during his virtual media briefing on Saturday. The Bushiris fled South Africa last week, contravening their bail conditions. The Hawks have since applied for a Red Notice from Interpol to facilitate the provisional arrest of the fugitive couple. Their R200 000 bail each has also been revoked. Baloyi says he is confident that the Bushiris understand the legal implications of their actions. “We’re taking the process as it unfolds. And we’re doing what is necessary within our legal capacity. So I’m not going to be ahead and say what is our plan but all I can say is we’re sticking to our initial and original plan. Look he’s a law abiding citizen at the end of the day, he does understand the law, or we do our best to make him understand the law”, says Baloyi. In a statement addressed to the Southern African Development Community, the leader of Enlightened Christian Gathering church says he will legally explain and defend his decision to flee South Africa for Malawi.
