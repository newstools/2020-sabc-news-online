Novavax Inc said on Monday it was on track to begin a delayed US-based, late-stage study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine later this month. The company also said the vaccine, NVX-CoV 2373, had been given “fast-track” status from the US Food and Drug Administration and that it expected data from the trial could support US authorization and approval. Novavax, which is testing the vaccine in a late-stage study in the UK, last month postponed the start of its US trial by roughly a month, due to delays in scaling up the manufacturing process. A handful of companies are testing their experimental coronavirus vaccines in late-stage studies. Pfizer Inc said on Monday initial data from the pivotal trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech showed that it was more than 90% effective.  Novavax on its quarterly results conference call said Pfizer’s data was a good sign for other vaccines in development. Fast-track status allows companies to submit sections of a marketing application on a rolling basis as soon as some data becomes available, rather than wait for all the data before seeking approval. The company said a Phase II vaccine trial in South Africa has reached 50% of its enrollment target. It’s UK trial has enrolled 60% of its intended participants, Novavax said.
