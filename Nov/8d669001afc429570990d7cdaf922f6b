Police have forced a group of  Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) members, who attempted to protest outside the Brackenfell High School in Cape Town, to return to the local train station. The group began their protest at the station, before trying to march to the school. Protests near the school have been ongoing over an alleged whites-only matric party a few weeks ago. Police members were seen using shields and stun grenades to push the PAC members back to the station. The group was forcefully moved from the intersection leading to the school all the way back to the train station where they started their protest. One of the PAC members involved in the demonstrations, Zethu Mdudo, says the police’s actions show that some areas in South Africa are more protected than others. She says they will be returning to the area on Friday, to support the EFF’s planned protest outside the school.  We remain unshaken they are terrorizing the PAC in Brackenfell to send the EFF a message that they will decisively deal with us. I’m angry we will not go backwards, forward we will go. We should carry matches and paraffin, if it means be we will baptize Brackenfell with fire! pic.twitter.com/kn7aJViyxt — Andi Motsepe (@AndiswaMadikazi) November 18, 2020
