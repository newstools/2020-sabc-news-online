The SABC has described as regrettable and unfortunate suggestions that it is planning to close down some of its radio stations. It says it is disingenuous to report such misinformation when the corporation knows that millions of people rely on radio as the most accessed communication medium. This comes amid proposed changes to the current structure of the public broadcaster. Group Executive for Human Resources at the SABC Mojaki Mosia says while the proposed structure will affect employees and the hours they will have to work, it will not lead to the closure of any of its radio stations. “It’s regrettable and just unfortunate, infact as we have communicated the newly proposed structures seek to promote and support the current needs of audiences because it seeks to extend into digital transformation, that is definitely not true that SABC is considering to close any of its radio stations, it’s absolutely not correct.” As the impasse between the SABC and workers over retrenchments continues, there are now calls for parliament to schedule an urgent debate on the SABC. The IFP has written to the Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise requesting a special sitting of parliament to discuss the challenges at SABC. The public broadcaster began a process of retrenchments of about 400 staff members last week. Letters were issued to staff informing them that their positions are either redundant or that they are considered surplus and have to reapply for their jobs. Unpacking SABC retrenchments:
