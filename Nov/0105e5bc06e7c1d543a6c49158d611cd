The African National Congress in the Free State says their members will defend the party’s leadership, as the law takes its course. This comes after the Hawks issued an arrest warrant for the ANC’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule, over his alleged involvement in the awarding of the R 255 million Free State asbestos roof audit tender. Magashule will have to hand himself over to the authorities before 10am on Friday, ahead of his appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrates’ Court. In the video below, SABC News Reporter, Samkele Maseko unpacks the Hawks’ warrant of arrest for Magashule: The spokesperson for the ANC in the Free State, Thabo Meeko says, “It is our principle position that when we believe and think that the leader of the ANC is under attack, structures and the entire membership of the ANC will rise in defence of that leadership. Individual member leaders of the ANC will be isolated and targeted with the intention to isolate them from the organisation and the people – and then we rise. We’ll accept the rule of law as these members of the ANC have the right as contained in the constitution to go to court and contest these allegations against them. Innocent until proven guilty ANC Youth League Free State Spokesperson Sello Peterson says there is a coordinated programme to utilise state institutions to fight internal political battles. He says their support for Magashule remains as he is innocent until proven guilty. Below is Peterson’s full interview: Asbestos audit case The accused in the multimillion rand asbestos audit case will appear in the Bloemfontein Regional Court on Wednesday. Seven people and five companies face more than 60 charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering related to the irregular awarding of the R255-million tender.
