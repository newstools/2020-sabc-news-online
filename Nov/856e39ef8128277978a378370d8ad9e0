The Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has announced that the commission will lay criminal charges against former South African Airways Board Chairperson Dudu Myeni. This comes after Myeni stunned the commission earlier this month when she revealed the identity of a secret witness. She referred to Mr X by his name four times during her evidence. This is in violation of the commission’s order not to identify him as he fears for his safety. Zondo described Myeni’s conduct as disrespectful to both the commission and himself: Meanwhile, former African National Congress (ANC) treasurer of the Greater Johannesburg region Geoffrey Makhubo is currently testifying before the commission. Makhubo’s evidence focuses on donations that EOH Africa made to the ANC. This week Managing Director of ENS Forensics, Steven David Powell named Makhubo as one of a number of ANC leaders who received irregular payments of more than R 1 million from EOH Africa through his service providing company Molelwane Consulting in 2012.
