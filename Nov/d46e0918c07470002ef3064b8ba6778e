The Westvaal Chamber of Business in Klerksdorp, in the North West, has honoured health workers in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District for their selfless dedication in the battle against COVID-19. Among them were nurses, doctors and management from 10 private and public hospitals. Chairperson for the Chamber, Kgotso Mmadi, says the chamber believes that those who contribute to the lives of others, must be recognised. “As business, we realised that the greatest asset in any business is its employees, and COVID-19 has adversely affected our employees. We had the health workers who were at the forefront to fight this, and we, therefore, thought to ourselves that it is imperative that after been doing such sterling work, they have to be appreciated to say to them as business we appreciate what they did.” ICN calls for better treatment of healthcare workers:  Among the health workers honoured, was Dr Thato Mosehle, the first runner-up in this year’s Miss South Africa pageant. She is a medical doctor at Tshepong hospital in Klerksdorp. “It’s so heartwarming and encouraging especially when you don’t feel like you are seen. You feel like you have to be always working, always putting your heart out there. I really appreciate such gestures. It does not have to be massive events, but small things like this and even a thank you. You know health workers encourage the public out there to say thank you. It pushes you into the next day.” SA health workers’ safety under spotlight:
