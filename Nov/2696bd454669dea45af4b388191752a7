The South African Police Services (SAPS) has told Parliament that nearly 400 corruption cases involving its members are being investigated by various law enforcement agencies. In its briefing to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, SAPS says transgressions are being committed by members across ranks from senior to junior levels. SAPS says 397 cases involving its members from lieutenant generals, major generals, brigadiers as well as other staff members are being investigated. The cases are for among others COVID-19 related matters, aiding escapees, defeating the ends of justice, theft, fraud and extortion. Three brigadiers, retired generals among SAPS officers arrested for alleged fraud, corruption in Pretoria:  National Police Commissioner Khehla Sithole says members, who resign while facing disciplinary charges, pensions have been frozen. “If a member happens to resign, firstly we check whether there is no criminal process pending so that that criminal process can continue. Secondly, we also further check whether this member has not caused the state to lose money or spend money otherwise and then once the CFO function scrutinizes and there’s an outcome that this person is owing the state, we instruct her to immediately freeze their pension.” The committee welcomed the arrest of Deputy National Commissioner Bonang Mgwenya. She was arrested recently in connection with a 2017 multi-million rand blue lights tender fraud matter. Deputy National Commissioner Bonang Mgwenya appears in court: SCOPA chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa says this is significant. “We need SAPS to lead by example and to ensure that you walk the talk. So, we want to see more arrests in SAPS, blue turning orange, and for you to clean up the mess and the rot which is in the SAPS.”
