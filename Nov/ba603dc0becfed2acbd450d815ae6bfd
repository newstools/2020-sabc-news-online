The ANC’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule has called on the public not to march to court or print regalia in his name when he appears in court on Friday.  This follows the meeting of the top six officials last night after the Hawks notified Magashule of his imminent arrest.  Magashule is being charged for corruption relating to his involvement in the R255-million asbestos project in the Free State while he was Premier.  He is expected to hand himself over to police on Friday morning before his subsequent appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrate Court.  ANC Deputy Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte, addressed the media in a virtual briefing.  “The SG assured officials that he will fully cooperate with the law enforcement agencies and will present himself to court on Friday. The SG expressed his preference to officials that he would not want any individual or groups to march, print posters, t-shirts and placards on this matter and in his name. The national officials expressed the wish that all structures respect this in the spirit of the ANC and the rule of law. The ANC officials continue to condemn all acts of corruption and maleficence.
