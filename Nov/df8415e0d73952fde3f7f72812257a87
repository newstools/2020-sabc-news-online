Three security guards, who were transporting money in the Florida cash-in-transit heist where a tow truck driver was shot and killed, will appear in the Krugersdorp Magistrate Court on Monday. Investigations led to the arrest of the trio after bags of money estimated at around R2.2 million were found hidden in a dustbin on the premises next to where the money van was attacked. A further R1 million was found hidden in the the bombed cash in transit van under the seat of the crew. The men aged 25, 28, and 40 are facing charges of murder, armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, possession of suspected stolen money, perjury, and defeating the ends of justice. The other suspects are still at large. Police have launched a manhunt for an undisclosed number of suspects after a failed cash-in-transit heist in Florida on Gauteng’s West Rand.
