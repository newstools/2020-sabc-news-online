“We as the MDUI are very very satisfied with the outcome of the court proceedings, it has been a four-year battle, we only had a placard demonstration next to the development, then interdicted for trespassing, opposed the interdict, led to the three-year litigation up to today where we reach an agreement with the City of  Cape Town that over 73 percent of our immediate community are now secured houses.” Mayoral Committee member on Human Settlements in the City of Cape Town, Malusi Booi, says they want to help the Morningstar beneficiaries without any further delay. Booi says they are also pleased to see the process going forward. He says City housing officials are busy preparing documents for the beneficiaries to move into their houses. “We follow our policy as a guideline and we have expressed our views as the City to the group that was contesting the beneficiaries and also had an engagement where we could found common ground that’s what we did, when the matter was back to court as a settlement, we all agreed that we incorporate everything we have discussed.” Booi says the City housing officials are busy preparing documents for the beneficiaries to move into their houses before the festive season.
