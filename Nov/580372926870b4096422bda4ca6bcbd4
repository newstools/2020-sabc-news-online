The Free State Department of Police, Roads and Transport will open its driving testing stations every two weeks on Saturdays to deal with the backlog in vehicle and licence renewals caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Driver licenses’ validity extended due to COVID-19:  Spokesperson for the department, Hillary Mophethe, says all district offices will operate on specific Saturdays from 8am to 2pm. “The department has taken the decision to open twice in a month just to fast track the backlog that we have at our registering authorities, two Saturdays in a month. The department has decided to render full services at our registering authorities.”
