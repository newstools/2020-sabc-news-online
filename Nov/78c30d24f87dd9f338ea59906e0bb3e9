A group of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members are expected to protest near the Brackenfell High School, in Cape Town, on Friday over allegations of racism at the school. The City of Cape Town has granted the party a permit, allowing 100 members to join the demonstration. Protests at the school have been ongoing, following reports of a private whites-only matric function at a private venue. Various other organisations are also expected to join Friday’s protest. Earlier this month, EFF supporters were confronted by parents outside the school, resulting in one arrest. In videos on social media, EFF supporters and some parents clashed over what’s believed to be a private matric celebration organised by some parents. The confrontation degenerated into a fistfight. EFF Western Cape Provincial Deputy Chair, Nosipho Makamba-Botya, speaks about the clashes outside the Brackenfell High:  The Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer has condemned the violent clashes outside Brackenfell High School:  Investigation President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the confrontation outside the school as deeply regrettable, and has called on all parties involved to act responsibly. Ramaphosa called for an urgent investigation into allegations of racism levelled against the school.
