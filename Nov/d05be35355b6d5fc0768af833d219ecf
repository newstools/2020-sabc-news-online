Former US Vice President Joe Biden is leading President Donald Trump in four key swing-state polls just 48 hours before election day in the world’s richest country. New York Times-Sienna Poll in Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin shows what has for the past weeks been a steady lead for Biden in must-win states for Trump, states without which he has no path to reclaiming a second term. Over 90 million voters have cast ballots in early voting. If these polls bear out on election day, Trump will lose and with that a second term as Biden leads by six in the traditional Republican stronghold of Arizona, which could vote for a Democratic for the first time since 1996 when Bill Clinton managed to flip the state – and before not since 1952. In the Times-Sienna poll out Sunday, Biden leads in Florida by three – another critical state for Republicans without which Trump has little chance of getting to the 270 delegates required to win the Electoral College. This new data comes out just as coronavirus cases surge across the country while the President continues to argue that the nation is turning the corner on the pandemic – a bizarre claim that is not borne out in the facts allowing his opponent to lambaste the current administration’s strategy with over 230-thousand dead and rising. Amidst heightened anxiety and record voter turnout, the United States is on edge after months of campaigning and a much-anticipated result just days away, at the very least.
