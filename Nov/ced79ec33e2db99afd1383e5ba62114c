The families of the three children, aged five months, two years, and five years who died in a fire at their home on Saturday at Northam in Limpopo have been receiving psycho-social counseling. It is believed that the burnt bodies of Sinenhlahla and Jabulani Tsotetsi as well as Katlego Mohale were recovered by firefighters after their home burnt to ashes. The minors were left in the house by their mother who was believed to have gone to buy food at a nearby spaza shop. Social Development spokesperson, Witness Tiva says they are supporting the family. “This horrific incident happened a day after we commemorated World Children’s Day which among other things is aimed at celebrating children and encouraging people to always ensure that children are protected and not exposed to harmful behaviour or environment. Our hearts are with the family of Sinenhlahla and Jabulani Tsotetsi as well as the family of Katlego Mohale during this time period. Our social workers will remain with the family providing them with all the necessary support that they need in this difficult period.”
