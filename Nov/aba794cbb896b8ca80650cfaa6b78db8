The late Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu’s service to South Africa was unparalleled in his commitment to the values of governance and his determination to make the country accountable when it comes to public spending. This is according to the Anglican Archbishop of Southern Africa Thabo Makgoba who extended condolences to the Makwetu family. Makwetu passed away after a battle with lung cancer. He was 54.  Makgoba says many South Africans and leaders in municipalities can learn from Makwetu’s honesty, integrity and courage. “It is a great pity that despite his and his staff’s work, the number of unqualified audits remains so high and that so much money is wasted on expenditure which does not serve the common good. I call on all South Africans and especially, those running municipalities to commit to serve all our citizens with integrity. Kimi Makwetu addressed Anglican formal events and our Synod of Bishops on a number of occasions and always pressed home the importance of honesty, integrity and courage. We will miss him and send our condolence to his wife and children, his family and all his loved ones.” Passing of Makwetu:  pic.twitter.com/guApfYdW19 — Auditor-General SA (@AuditorGen_SA) November 11, 2020
