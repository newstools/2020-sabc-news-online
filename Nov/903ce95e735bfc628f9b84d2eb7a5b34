Lack of basic services in Ipelegeng township, near Schweizer Reneke in the North West, has caused a rift between residents and authorities. This is after some residents in the Mamusa Local Municipality bought stands in ward seven with the hope of building homes. But despite promises from local authorities, services such as water and electricity, have not been provided. Three years ago, the Mamusa Local Municipality took a resolution to sell municipal land to the community to encourage residents to buy stands so the municipality can increase its revenue collection by providing services. Residents built homes under the impression that basic services will be provided. This was not to be, and a representative of the community, Phemelo Mongale, says the municipality must keep its promises. “We want our municipality to address our demands. We are not saying we are better than other people but all that we want is services because we bought these stands because they told us to do so if we can.” Jacqueline Maseng says she paid for a municipal stand but has not been allocated land as yet. “On the 7th of July, I went to pay the remaining balance of R12  500. Till today, I did not receive my stand. Every time when I go to the municipality they tell me to come tomorrow and so on.” The municipality has acknowledged these shortcomings but says a recent meeting with Premier Job Mokgoro should bring a solution. Spokesperson for the Mamusa Local Municipality Jerry Maine says, “The premier visited us the other day. He was here sometime last week. He has also made a commitment that he will engage the Department of Local Government to assist us in providing the residents there with the required infrastructure.” The municipality says residents should be patient, while they await assistance from the provincial government.
