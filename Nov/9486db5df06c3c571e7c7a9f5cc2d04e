A 58-year-old woman has been shot dead, her 21-year-old son shot and injured while her 31-year-old daughter was raped by an intruder at their home at Motete C village outside Groblersdal in Limpopo. The police’s Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe says the family was asleep when an armed intruder wearing a balaclava held them hostage and abducted the 31-year-old woman. Her mother and the brother tried to intervene and the intruder shot dead the mother and injured the son. He then continued dragging the 31-year-old woman to a secluded area where he repeatedly raped her before fleeing the scene. Ngoepe says a 72-hour turnaround plan to arrest the suspect has been activated. “Provincial police commissioner, General Nneke Ledwaba, has established a task team to track down the suspect who allegedly attacked the family after he shot dead the mother, injured the son and raped the daughter at Motete village in the Denelton policing area. The suspect involved in this matter is still unknown and there is no arrest yet. Anyone with information can contact Colonel Richard Moshomane on 0798945501.”
