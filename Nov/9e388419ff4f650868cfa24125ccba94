Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo will convene a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how to deal with the huge backlog for vehicle licence renewals. Many licence and testing centres were closed for an extended period during the hard lockdown, which exacerbated the situation. The deadline to renew licences for motorists whose cards expired between March and the end of August this year has been extended to January. It has been extremely difficult for people to book a slot online. Mamabolo says the backlog challenges are now affecting people whose licences expired in September. In the video below, Road Traffic Management Corporation Spokesperson Simon Zwane provides clarity on licence renewals and grace periods during lockdown:  Online booking system deemed dysfunctional Some residents in Gauteng say the online booking system for vehicle licence renewals has failed them. The Automobile Association (AA) says it has also received a number of complaints from motorists countrywide who have been unable to renew their vehicle licenses. AA Spokesperson Layton Beard says with thousands of motorists struggling to renew their licences, the failure of the system is being exposed even more. Beard says they remain concerned about traffic authorities that are targeting motorists at roadblocks with expired licences. He says traffic policing should be about road safety and not revenue collection. -Additional reporting by Prabashni Moodley
