The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has vowed to continue its strike if government does not accede to its demands by the deadline this coming Thursday. The union says it will also seek legal recourse if the matter is not addressed. Nehawu is demanding that government permanently employ community healthcare workers. The union wants government to give workers equal benefits to other government employees. It handed over a memorandum of demands to the MEC’s of all nine provinces as well as to the offices of the Premiers. Meanwhile, experts say community health workers are an important element in the government’s administration of its primary health care strategy. Nehawu in North West threatened to remove premier Job Mokgoro’s administration, should it fail to employ community health workers permanently. Community Health Workers in North West  have been on strike for three weeks:  Nehawu president Mzwandile Makwayiba says, “On one hand as we speak we on strike but on another hand we are putting together legal minds in terms of putting together and seeing where from a legal point of view where can we lock this to happen force the government to comply because my understanding is that even in the area of Gauteng they been absorbed because there was a case there was a legal case that compelled the Gauteng government. So we’re looking into all of those areas to see how best we can force government. In the Northern Cape, Nehawu promised to intensify protests until they receive a satisfactory response. Nehawu provincial treasurer Regina Manhe said community health workers in the province have been working for the past six months without pay.
