The Department of Health in Limpopo is simultaneously screening for coronavirus and malaria as patients for both diseases show similar symptoms. This was announced by Health MEC Doctor Phophi Ramathuba at Ha-Gumbu near the Kruger National Park where anti-malaria teams were spraying households. “We are saying this year is a different year where we are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, which presents with almost the same, such as a headache, fever, some people vomit and have diarrhea. So, during our community healthcare approach, we have made sure that they carry malaria test kits so that when they get into your house they don’t only take specimens for COVID-19, we are also screening you for malaria.” Malaria spraying campaign in Niani outside Musina in Limpopo:
