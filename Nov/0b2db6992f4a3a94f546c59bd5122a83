Higher Education Minister Dr Blade Nzimande has welcomed the arrest of five suspects linked to the murder of Coastal TVET College student Smanga Zulu in KwaZulu-Natal. Zulu was shot along with two other students from the college two weeks ago. They were taken to the KwaMakhutha Clinic where Zulu died on arrival. Department spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi says, “Two suspects appeared in uMbumbulu Magistrate Court on the 2nd November 2020, the other three appeared in the same court yesterday [Tuesday]…” “It is anticipated that these suspects will be facing charges ranging from murder to suspected murder. The case has been postponed to the 11th of November 2020,” adds Mnisi. The other two students are recovering in hospital. In another shooting last Friday, the head of Infrastructure at the college, Lindinkosi Mazibuko, was also shot and killed at the institution’s parking lot by an unknown man. Nzimande congratulated the SAPS for swiftly arresting the suspects and urged them to work tirelessly to also arrest the assailants who shot and killed Mazibuko.
