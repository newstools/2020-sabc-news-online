The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is in Parliament to discuss the latest developments in its Section 189 process. On Tuesday, an urgent meeting between newsroom staff and some executives in the public broadcaster created confusion when Group Executive of News, Phathiswa Magopeni said she would not be going ahead with the issuing of retrenchment letters. SABC Board Chair Bongumusa Makhathini says the retrenchment is continuing and the corporation will deal with the aforementioned executive. 400 SABC employees are set to be retrenched, with the process expected to be completed by the end of December 2020.
