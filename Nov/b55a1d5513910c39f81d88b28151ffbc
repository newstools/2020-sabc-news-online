Traditional initiation schools remain suspended. The winter initiation season was called off when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country earlier this year. As the country moved through lockdown alert levels to Level 1, there was a possibility that the rite of passage would resume for the summer season. However, the sharp rise in infections in the Eastern Cape has prevented its resumption. Nonetheless not everybody is adhering to the regulations with some families sending their boys for the rite of passage. Authorities had to close down an initiation school located between East London and King William’s Town. The father of an initiate Chuluphele Ngwabeni says postponing the rite of passage for his son was not an option. “He is going to varsity next year I wanted him to go being a man. l had saved so much money to see to it that this happens,” he says. The continued suspension of the initiation practice is done with the view to save lives and curb the spread of the coronavirus. Buffalo City Initiation forum chairperson, Chief Stanley Makinana calls on families to be patient. “We are calling for our (people) to exercise patience while the government is making considerations on the matter it is in their best interest.” Provincial Cogta Spokesperson, Mamkeli Ngam, says there will be severe consequences for not adhering to the regulations. “All those people who operate amabhoma are going to be arrested and they will have their days in court.” The provincial government estimates that 40 000 boys were due to undergo the rite of passage during this summer season.
