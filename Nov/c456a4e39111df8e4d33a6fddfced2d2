The Bloemfontein Magistrates Court has released on bail 14 of the 18 suspects arrested on allegations of fraud and corruption. They were released on bail ranging between R5000 and R10 000. The accused, including a police officer and traffic department officials, were arrested in Gauteng, the Eastern Cape, Limpopo and the Free State for allegedly registering unroadworthy cars in exchange for bribes. NPA spokesperson Phaladi Shuping says the four accused, who did not get bail, will again appear in court on Thursday next week. “The case against the accused was postponed to 19 January 2021. But there are 4 who are in custody because the State still needs to confirm their addresses they will be appearing again on 12 November which will be on Thursday.”
