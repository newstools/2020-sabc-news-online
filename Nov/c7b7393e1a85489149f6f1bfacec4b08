He says he will only respect the voices of ANC branches because they elected him. Magashule says he can go to every individual in the ruling party and point out what they have done. “This is the ANC of masses so don’t come and claim because I can do what you are doing and go to everything individual that’s how we are taught so l will never leave the ANC. I will remain in ANC, you won’t remove me, I will remain there. I will go and work with you at the ANC. Magashule’s court appearance: Magashule supporters burn t-shirts bearing  ANC President Ramaphosa’s face Earlier in the day, disgruntled supporters of Magashule set alight ANC t-shirts bearing the face of party President Cyril Ramaphosa outside the court. More supporters including former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, former Cabinet Minister Malusi Gigaba and MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus arrived at the court. Magashule had already handed himself over to the Hawks. The protesters said that Magashule should be the President of the ANC. “If in reality anyone was supposed to be charged for failure to oversee, there was a certain amount of R500 billion that was meant for COVID-19 that was mismanaged with evidence. And now, it means that the President must be arrested,” says one protester. “Because SG is the humble servant of the organisation and loyal to the organisation – those who want to paint him as a criminal must go and kill themselves somewhere. We want Ace Magashule to be President; we can’t take it anymore. President Ramaphosa must go and sit at home because he is busy selling us out; he wants to kill the ANC,” says another protester.
