Presiding Judge in the case of Pastor Timothy Omotoso, Judge Irma Schoeman, is on Tuesday expected to give a ruling on the scrapping of evidence by two witnesses and changes made to the indictment by the state. The Omotoso trial has resumed at the Port Elizabeth High Court. Defence attorney Peter Dauberman has asked Judge Irma Schoeman to find the evidence of two witnesses inadmissible entirely. He said their evidence was not relevant to the case against Omotoso. He also said among other things, that it was prejudicial to the accused. Omotoso was arrested three and a half years ago and had three failed bail applications. His two female co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho are currently out on bail.
