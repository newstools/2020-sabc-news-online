Donald Trump is accusing the Democrats of trying to cheat him of victory. The US President addressed the media at the White House. He is accusing the Biden camp of trying to steal votes. “If you count the legal votes, I easily win,” he told reporters. He also described the election results so far as a major fraud and an embarrassment to America. Trump says he was winning a number of locations and then the numbers started dwindling away, secretly. He says legal observers were barred from monitoring the vote count in some instances. In Philadelphia, he says, observers are being kept far away from voting centres, forcing them to use binoculars. “This is the case where they are trying to steal an election and we can’t let that happen.” Trump cries foul:  The US President also complained about the record number of mail-in ballots, which were cast due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He says votes were lodged after polls closed. “Democrats officials believe they could never win the election and that is why they did the mail-in ballots where there is tremendous corruption and fraud going on.” Trump says Pennsylvania is part of the Democrat corrupt machine and Detroit has a bad reputation around polls. The US President says his team will legally challenge all Biden-claimed states. His remarks come as his rival Joe Biden edges closer to victory. The former vice president is leading  with 264 electoral college votes. Biden has called for calm and patience, while also appealing for each ballot to be counted. He needs 270 electoral college votes to become America’s 46th President and he has said that he expects to win the race when vote counting ends. Road to the White House winding:  Trump’s previous rants over the elections sparked tensions in America. There were protests in New York and Manhattan. Demonstrators demanded a thorough count of ballots. At least 50 people were arrested in New York when things went south.
