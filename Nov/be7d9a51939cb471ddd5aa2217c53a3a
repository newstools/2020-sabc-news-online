Gauteng MEC Panyaza Lesufi says 82% of grades one and 8 learners have been placed in Gauteng schools. Lesufi was speaking during a media briefing in Johannesburg, on the online admissions which commenced at the beginning of last month and will end on Monday. He says unlike the previous years, the process ran smoothly with no major hiccups. However, they have to now focus on placing the remaining 18% of learners. “We had more applications than the number of classrooms that we had. And this has created a huge headache for the department and to the parents. We are quite aware that many parents are in panic mode. 191 119 applications were properly placed. And unfortunately 41 196 parents have not received their placements.”
