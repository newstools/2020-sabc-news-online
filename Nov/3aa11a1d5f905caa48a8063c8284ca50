The Gauteng Health Department is conducting a massive antibody survey to try to understand the extent of COVID-19 infections in the province. The provincial department is working in partnership with Wits University, the Medical Research Council, VIDA Research Unit and the University of Pretoria. Departmental Spokesperson, Kwara Kekana, says the survey will assist government to better understand how the virus is spreading. “Antibody or Seroprevalence surveys are investigations that use antibody testing to determine the percentage of people who have been infected with COVID-19. There are many people in Gauteng who possibly had COVID-19 but were never counted as COVID-19 cases because they were never tested. The reason why they were not tested could be that they did not have symptoms of COVID-19 or did not meet the criteria to have a test. The survey will assist government to better understand how the virus is spreading throughout the Gauteng population over time and to be able to put adequate response measures to stop its further spread.” South Africa has recorded 1 770 new cases of the global infectious disease since the last report, bringing the total number of infections to 725 452. In a statement on Saturday, the Health Department reported 46 COVID-19 related deaths. Gauteng remains on the lead with the number of infections. #COVID19 Statistics in SA as at 31 October.
