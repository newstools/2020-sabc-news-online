The Hawks have applied for a Red Notice with Interpol to provisionally arrest the Bushiri-couple. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. The leaders of the Enlightened Christian Gatherings (ECG) church, Shepherd Bushiri, and his wife, Mary, fled from South Africa to Malawi last week in contravention of their bail conditions. Their bail of R200 000 each has been revoked by the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. The couple and their three co-accused are charged with fraud, theft and money laundering involving more than R100 million. Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale, says the arrest notice will become active if the Bushiris are not at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. “Extradition means you know where the suspect is. A Red Notice is to let the other country [Malawi] know you are looking for that person [Bushiris] and through Interpol. Should they have that person in their country, law enforcement agencies in that country must ensure that he [wanted person] is provisionally arrested. So that we can arrest him with our warrant. We have applied for a Red Notice for the Bushiris through Interpol,” explains Mogale.
