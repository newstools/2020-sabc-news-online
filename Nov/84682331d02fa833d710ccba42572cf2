Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams is expected to make an announcement on the planned retrenchments at the SABC on Tuesday. This follows her meeting with Labour Minister, Thulas Nxesi, SABC unions and the public broadcaster’s board on Monday. However, the Communications Workers’ Union (CWU) says it will continue with lunch-time pickets.  The CWU wants the retrenchment of 400 permanent staff to be stopped immediately. They are also calling for the SABC board to be dissolved and for the SABC to be placed under administration. Meanwhile, the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers’ Union (Bemawu) has vowed to proceed with seeking an urgent interdict from the Labour Court.
