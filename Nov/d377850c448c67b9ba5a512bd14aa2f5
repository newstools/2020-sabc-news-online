A senior prosecutor in the Timothy Omotoso trial, Advocate Zukile Mdolomba, has died. Mdolomba passed away yesterday morning. This was confirmed by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Eastern Cape. Advocate Mdolomba successfully opposed Omotoso’s bail application in the High Court in Port Elizabeth a few weeks ago. He was one of the three prosecutors in the rape and human trafficking case against Omotoso. The NPA’s Eastern Cape regional spokesperson Anelisa Ngcakani says they are determined to ensure a successful prosecution. Omotoso bail appeal application judgment  Omotoso trial Last week, the trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court was postponed to Monday morning. It was alleged that a member of the state’s legal team tested positive for the coronavirus, and a colleague was in quarantine. Omotoso and his two co-accused are facing more than 90 sex-related charges. It is alleged that young women from the Jesus Dominion International were lured to a mission house in KwaZulu-Natal where they would have been spiritually educated but instead they were allegedly sexually assaulted and raped. Last week, Omotoso’s legal team gave reasons for his application to apply for leave to appeal the ruling of Judge, Philip Zilwa, who refused to grant him bail. Omotoso’s legal team argued that Judge Zilwa did not apply his mind to certain aspects of the bail application and that there were irregularities in his ruling. This is the third time Omotoso has tried to get bail since his arrest three years ago. Omotoso bail appeal application judgment, 11 November 2020
