Ivory Coast appeared to have averted large-scale violence on Saturday in a presidential election boycotted by the opposition, although there were conflicting reports of scattered unrest in the provinces. The streets of the largest city Abidjan were quiet and voting appeared to have gone smoothly in most districts. Opponents accuse President Alassane Ouattara of violating the constitution by seeking a third term, and there had been concern that the voting could turn violent after more than 30 people were killed in pre-election unrest. The opposition said whole swathes of the country had not participated in the vote or had been prevented from doing so. Candidate Pascal Affi Nâ€™Guessan said the opposition estimated around 12 people had died as a result of civil disobedience campaigns. A government source said two people had been killed and more wounded in clashes outside Abidjan. Ruling party representative Adama Bictogo reported there had been deaths but gave no figure. Police gave no update. But Ouattara played down the extent of any violence or disruption.
