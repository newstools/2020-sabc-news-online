The tender fraud case involving former Department of Correctional Services (DCS) and Bosasa officials has been postponed by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court to February 18 next year. This is to allow the legal teams of former DCS commissioner Linda Mti, former DCS CFO Patrick Gillingham, former Bosasa CFO Andries van Tonder and former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi, an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the case docket consisting of thousands of pages. The charges are in connection with four tenders awarded by the Department to Bosasa and its subsidiaries from August 2004 to 2007. The tenders were valued at more than R1.8 billion. Spokesperson for the Investigating Directorate in the National Prosecuting Authority, Sindisiwe Twala, says Agrizzi was again not present in court. Twala says, “The four accused that was to appear in the specialised commercial crimes court, only four appeared. Angelo Agrizzi, through his lawyer, basically presented that he is still in ICU and won’t be able to appear before court. We must also mention there was a warrant of arrest issued for him because of the last time he did not appear before court. However, a medical certificate has been issued and sent even to the magistrate in this matter. But the warrant of arrest still lingers until the time he presents himself. However, it’s not executable.” Agrizzi was denied bail in October: Last year, Agrizzi told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that Mti received a monthly bribe of R 65 000 from the company.
