The three men accused of shooting dead a Coastal KZN TVET College student, Smanga Zulu, will spend their Christmas behind bars as their bail application will only be heard on January 11. The three accused are Skhalo Mzulwini, Vusumuzi Khuzwayo, and Lebohang Molefe. They appeared briefly at the Umbumbulu Magistrate’s Court south of Durban. They are charged with the murder of Zulu and the attempted murder of two other students in October this year. In another shooting in October, the head of Infrastructure at the college, Lindinkosi Mazibuko, was also shot and killed at the institution’s parking lot by an unknown man.
