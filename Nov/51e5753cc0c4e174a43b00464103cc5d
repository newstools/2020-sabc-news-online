Executive Director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, says it is disappointing that gender-based violence continues to increase in the country, despite interventions to prevent it. Mlambo-Ngcuka was delivering a virtual memorial lecture in honour of the late former ANC president Chief Albert Luthuli. This year’s lecture focus was on the recent scourge of Gender-Based Violence, which the President described as a pandemic of its own. Mlambo-Ngcuka says the increasing incidents are proof that more still needs to be done. “To end gender-based violence and for gender-based violence to be made history have fallen short. In this area, change is desperately needed including in our country. We want to see an equivalent determination in the fight to end violence against women as I’ve said we’ve seen an escalation of violence.” Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka delivers Chief Albert Luthuli Memorial Lecture:
