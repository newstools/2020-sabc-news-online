KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu, says all Grade R learners from Richards Bay Primary School in the province have been screened for coronavirus, following allegations that a fellow Grade R learner tested positive for the virus. It is believed that the test was conducted at a private laboratory. The school was closed on Monday following concerns.

You will also remember that I think it was in Free State where a case of coronavirus was confirmed after being tested by a private lab, but later on it appeared that was not the case.

All the Grade R learners were screened by the NICD and they said they can only test them once they confirm if the other one has tested positive,” says Mshengu. Meanwhile, Mshengu says they are awaiting confirmation from the National Education Department on whether the Easter holiday classes for matric learners will still go ahead.
