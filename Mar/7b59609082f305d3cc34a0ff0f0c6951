Six vehicles from the KwaZulu Natal Department of Social Development in Ladysmith have been set alight, by protesting residents who are demanding the resignation of Mayor Vincent Madlala. It is alleged that a group of residents]forced their way into Social Development offices and torched the vehicles. Head of Department Sibusiso Ngubane says this is a major setback for those in need of services. Ngubane said, “These are cars that are used for service delivery, we have our social workers, who go out and help assist the public using them. We have got services that have to continue but now they have since been disrupted.” “For now we will just wait for the situation to calm down and investigate to see what plans we can put in place just to make sure that we do not have a situation where services are prolonged for a long time,” added Ngubane. An organisation called Ubumbano Lokuthula in Ladysmith has been on the campaign to oust Madlala, who has been accused of corruption and nepotism. The organisation has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to urgently intervene. Ubumbano Lokuthula’s Andile Hlatswayo says the African National Congress (ANC) at regional and provincial level are dragging their feet. Ladysmith has been brought to a standstill due to several violent protests. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala said that the allegations against Madlala would be investigated, while Madlala has denied any wrongdoing. Police are monitoring the situation. Vusi Khumalo reports on protests in Ladysmith which have affected; businesses, schooling and delivery of services.
