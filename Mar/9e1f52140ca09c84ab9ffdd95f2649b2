AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, has been arrested at the Bumbane Great Place in Mthatha. It is alleged that Dalindyebo went on a rampage, attacking family members with pangas, bushknives and axes. His son acting king, Azenathi Zaneliswa Dalindyebo, was allegedly among those assaulted. The acting king was central to conflict within the royal family, after the king’s incarceration in 2015. He was appointed to this role after winning a court battle against his uncle Prince Mthandeni Mankunku Dalindyebo, over the abaThembu kingship. The pair subsequently made peace in 2018. King Dalindyebo, who was released on parole on 22 December 2019, was arrested at the royal palace on Friday morning. Spectators watch as a police van hauls away King Dalindyebo, outside the Bumbane Great Palace:  Fleeing from the king’s wrath According to a witness at the scene, Dalindyebo arrived at the royal palace around 3am armed with several weapons. After apparently breaking a window with a crow bar and shouting profanities, he allegedly began searching for the acting king, who quickly fled from the residence. He was reportedly with an accomplice. Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo says he was among several occupants who were forced to seek safety elsewhere amid the attack, some of whom fled on foot. “The king was targeting his son”  The wife of acting king Azenathi Zaneliswa Dalindyebo was injured during the attack, and has been admitted to hospital. King Dalindyebo was released on parole at the end of 2019 as a result of a special remission of sentence by President Cyril Ramaphosa. He had been convicted in 2015 for several crimes including seven counts of kidnapping, three of assault, three of arson and one of defeating the ends of justice
