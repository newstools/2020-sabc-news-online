Ethiopia has closed its land borders in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. This comes as Zimbabwe and Nigeria confirm their first deaths from the virus. Ethiopia still accepts flights in and out of the country but its national airline, Ethiopian Airlines, has stopped flights to at least 30 countries where travel restrictions have been enforced. Ethiopia borders Eritrea, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, Djibouti and Somalia. All these except South Sudan have reported cases of coronavirus. Closing its land borders to protect the spread of COVID-19, means that people will not be able to cross and leave the country to and from these countries by road. Ethiopia’s neighbours like Kenya and Djibouti have cancelled international flights meaning Ethiopia’s National Airline, Ethiopian Airlines is banned too. This decision will mean trade between Kenya and Ethiopia will be affected but also affect cargo movement of goods in and out of the country from the Djibouti port. Landlocked Ethiopia depends on the Djibouti port for importation of majority of its goods. Djibouti will also be affected because it buys drinking water, vegetable grains and from Ethiopia. South Sudanese people will not be able to cross into Ethiopia seeking refuge Ethiopia has allocated over 150 million dollars for combating the pandemic.
