Authorities say the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa has jumped by around 23% in two days to 150. This emerged at a media conference in Pretoria attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa. South Africa has had no reported deaths from the virus that has claimed the lives of almost 9 000 people worldwide.  To mitigate the situation, government has introduced a range of new measures to try and slow the spread of the virus. These include closing bars and restaurants that serve alcohol at 18:00. President Ramaphosa says South Africa is at war with the coronavirus. “As the coronavirus sweeps across the globe, country upon country has announced tough restrictions on public life. As policymakers, we struggle to deal with the biggest public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic. France says it may extend the two-week-long coronavirus lockdown as a shortage of face masks bites. In the Netherlands, Dutch banks have agreed to six month freeze on loan repayments for small businesses. And China, the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, has for the first time reported no new local coronavirus transmissions.”     In the video below, government brief the media on regulations to slow down the spread of COVID-19.
