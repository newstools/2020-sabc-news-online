The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court has sentenced #FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini to two-years and six-months – suspended for five years. Earlier, Dlamini was found guilty of public violence, after being in and out of court for the last four years. He was arrested at his University of Witwatersrand residence in October 2016, during the protests for free higher education. The #FeesMustFall leader was initially denied bail; however, that decision was overturned by the High Court in Johannesburg. Since his arrest in 2016, Dlamini made more than 30 appearances in court. Following Monday’s ruling, Dlamini took to Facebook, stating; “Today marked the end of my legal career. The Court found me guilty of public violence thus sentenced me to 2 years 6 months, suspended sentence of 5 years. I will take time to reflect on my future moving forward including my political career.”
