Hundred of Soshanguve residents have once again flocked to the Soshanguve Crossing to buy essential items. Some shoppers say this will not help reduce the rapid spread of the deadly COVID-19 as people chose to defy government instruction of wearing masks and keeping distance. The number of infections are continuing to rise as the country has now 1280 confirmed cases of the virus. Traffic officials including Tshwane Metro Police and SAPS officers are stationed at the two main entrances to the shopping centre controlling the number of people who are going inside the inside. Meanwhile, local taxi operators can be seen ferrying more than 3 passengers in their Toyota Ventures as guided by the new regulations.
