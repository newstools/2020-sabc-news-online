The alcohol industry in South Africa will donate 40 000 litres of alcohol for the production of sanitisers. This comes as the country faces a shortage of alcohol-based sanitisers. South Africa has experienced a big jump in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with 402 now being confirmed in the country. That’s an increase of 128 or 47%. The industry says it fully supports government’s decision to limit hours of alcohol trade in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Government has restricted alcohol trade to between 9:00 and 18:00 from Monday to Saturday and 9:00 to 13:00pm on Sunday. “The major thing that we would like to put on the table as the industry is the donation of pure alcohol that is used to produce sanitisers. Currently we have offered 40 000 litres, various companies are working on plans to make additional donations. We understand that there is indeed a shortage of alcohol for sanitisers and we would like to make sure that we close that gap,” says Sibani Mngadi, Spokesperson.
