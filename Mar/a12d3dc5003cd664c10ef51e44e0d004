A roof over one’s head is a basic human right that some take for granted. But for two orphaned boys from the Northern Cape, it’s something they dream of. The teenagers, aged 14 and 16 have been living in a toilet since their shack burnt down two years ago. In the video below, the plight of the boys are highlighted:  One of the boys says that if his mother was still alive he could have finished school and got a job to support her and his brother. Neighbours are aware of the boys’ dire situation but are unable to help due to their lack of resources. One of the neighbours says, “Our wish for us as a community is that these kids are offered a shack.” The Northern Cape Social Development Department says they are aware of the boys’ plight. The department says they are urgently looking for a solution for the orphans.
