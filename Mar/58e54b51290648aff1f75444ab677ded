Eskom says it has reached an out-of-court settlement with Deloitte Consulting over the irregular procurement process that saw the international consulting firm collect R207 million in fees from the cash-strapped power utility. The agreement ends five months of legal wrangling for money paid to Deloitte from 2016 to 2017. Eskom has maintained that Deloitte inflated the fees following an irregular procurement process. In the video below, Political Commentator Khaya Sithole details how Deloitte received two consulting contracts at Eskom where it had partnered with auditing firm Nkonki Inc.  The agreement was reached on Friday. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the parties also agreed that the investigation found no form of state capture or corruption. Deloitte will pay Eskom R150 million. The parties further agreed that the investigation completed by Eskom and Deloitte showed no evidence of state capture of corruption and that Eskom did benefit from services that Deloitte Consulting rendered during the period of the agreement. Eskom continues to benefit from these. There were technical irregularities within the procurement process and Deloitte Consulting accepts that it participated in this irregular procurement process.‚Äù
