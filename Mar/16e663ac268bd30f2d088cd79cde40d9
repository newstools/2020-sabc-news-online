Botswana’s President, Mokgweetsi Masisi has declared a state of emergency and ordered the country to go into lockdown from Thursday. This comes as Botswana reports three confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. Making the declaration a short while ago – Masisi says the threat to Batswana has escalated as neighbouring countries continue to report increasing cases of COVID-19. President Masisi says he is concerned by the low rate of testing in the country especially after the influx of his citizens returning from high risk countries which now imposed lockdowns. He says this prompted the decision to institute the 28 day lockdown from April 2, 2020. Batswana will be severely restricted in their movements and essential service workers will have to obtain permits from government. A COVID-19 relief fund has also be established to provide psycho-social support which also includes measures to stabilise business and ensure availability of strategic supplies. Government will also issue subsidies to supplement wages of workers in the private sector affected by the COVID-19 lockdown.
