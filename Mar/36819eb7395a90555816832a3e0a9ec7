The trial of the controversial pastor Timothy Omotoso has been postponed to April 14 in the Port Elizabeth High Court, in the Eastern Cape. The state will be making changes to its legal team. Some of the new team members will include prosecutor Ishmet Cerfontein. Prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa, who had been on the case since it started in 2017, has been taken off the trial. Reasons for this move have not been given. Omotoso and co-accused Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Sulani are facing over 90 charges of sexual offence. These include rape, human trafficking and racketeering.  Last week, a second witness in the case took to stand. Lerato Msibi told the court about the sexual abuse she allegedly endured at the hands of Omotoso. Her testimony mirrored that of the first witness, Andiswa Dike. It was, however, halted due to concerns by the defence team. Defence lawyer Peter Dauberman argued that the two witnesses were led to testify about aspects not contained in the indictment.
