The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has called on people not to panic over the coronavirus. Member of the provincial parliament, Rachel Windvogel, says the party will embark an awareness campaign. This will be done in partnership with civil society and the religious fraternity. Windvogel says the ANC is also calling on the provincial government to educate people about ways of protecting themselves. She has suggested that they will invest in producing radio and newspaper advertisements in bid to reach the poorest of the poor. Health minister Zweli Mkhize meanwhile says their efforts to locate all the people who have been in contact with the country’s three confirmed cases of the deadly coronavirus have started to yield positive results. A couple from Hilton, outside Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal as well as a woman in Gauteng have tested positive for the virus. They were all part of a group of ten that had travelled to Italy and returned to South Africa on March. The couple’s children have tested negative but will remain in self-quarantine. Mkhize says their efforts are on track. “We have ascertained who the people are that would have got into contact with the first patient since he got from Dubai up to the time he went to the doctor. We’ve got the whole list – those who were in the plane, we’ve actually picked up information from the aircraft. We are tracing them all and those who were met outside the plane from the airport to the house, we’ve got that whole list, so we tracing all of them together.” Reduce your risk of contracting the coronavirus:   Supply chains broken
