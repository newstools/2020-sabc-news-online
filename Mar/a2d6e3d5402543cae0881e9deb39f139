Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Legal Risk Executive, Martha Ngoye, is on Monday expected to continue outlining the situation at the state-owned enterprise before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Last week, the commission heard evidence from Prasa’s former board chairperson, Popo Molefe. He said he was left shaken after meeting with former president Jacob Zuma, who tried to reverse the Prasa board’s decision to accept former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lucky Montana’s resignation. Molefe also explained the condition Prasa was in after the Auditor-General found irregular expenditure worth more than R500 million. “I challenged the president to come and challenge the board of control at Prasa. What was quite apparent in that meeting and of great concern was that the president and the president of the governing party, which are the custodians of all the governing bodies including the constitution was now directly attempting to interfere with matters of the board of directors of Prasa, that was really of great concern,” says Molefe.
