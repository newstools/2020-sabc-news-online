The Nelson Mandela University (NMU) has turned to its own experts and facilities to produce hand sanitiser, which is in short supply in Port Elizabeth. The university’s institute for chemical technology managed to produce 200 litres of sanitiser in two days from its own raw materials. “The first batch of the hand santiser has been decanted and has been despatched to key entrance areas and other common spaces around the university,” says NMU spokesperson, Zandile Mbabela. Experts say that washing your hands is a key part of preventing the spread of viruses such as the coronavirus. In the video below, Dr. Kgosi Letlape explains how washing hands properly prevents the spread of diseases.  Meanwhile, in the video below, the South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO)  handed out hand sanitisers at the Chesterville taxi Rank in Durban.
