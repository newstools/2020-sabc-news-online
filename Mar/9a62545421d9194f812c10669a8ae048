Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has called for prayer to combat the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Mogoeng briefs the media about contingency measures being put in place at all our courts. These are in line with government directives following President Cyril Ramaphosa declaring the pandemic a national disaster. The Chief Justice was speaking from his offices in Midrand, Johannesburg. “May God bless our people we need not to be as cursed as we appear to be by this virus but to be blessed. We need an economy that is flourishing we need normalcy to shake hands and hug and those who know just how powerful prayer can be I plead with you from the depths of my heart that at least every Wednesday and every Sunday go out there in groups that do not exceed 70 to pray.” Video below:
