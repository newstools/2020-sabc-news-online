The defamation case against African National Congress member of parliament, Boy Mamabolo will be heard at the Polokwane High Court in Limpopo on Wednesday. Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema and his wife have instituted legal action against Mamabolo for alleging that Malema abuses his wife. The case started during the State of the Nation Address when MP Boy Mamabolo stood in parliament and claimed that EFF leader, Julius Malema abuses his wife, Mantoa. He said he was revealing this in line with a directive by President Cyril Ramaphosa to fight gender based violence. He allegedly repeated the allegations during an interview with a newspaper a day later. Mamabolo has since apologised to the Malemas, claiming that he was fed wrong information by friends who are jealous of the family.
