Eskom says CEO Andre De Ruyter will meet with Gauteng Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile over the debt owed by the Emfuleni Municipality in the Vaal. Debt-riddled power utility Eskom says it will continue with the seizure of assets at the Emfuleni Local Municipality in the Vaal. The municipality failed to meet Friday’s deadline to pay Eskom R262 million toward the total debt of R2.3 billion that is owed. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says, “Eskom would like to confirm as well that the chief executive is scheduled to meet maile. This meeting, however, does not interfere with the efforts to collect monies from the municipality.” Last week, the sheriff of the court began seizing assets from the municipality in order to enforce a court order for Eskom to recoup R615 million of the total amount owed.

Mantshantsha says Eskom had demanded a payment of R222 million plus R40 million which is outstanding from their last payment in order to suspend the confiscation of municipal property. “The sheriff of the court will proceed again with attaching property belonging to the municipality. This is in an attempt to collect on the R615 million for which Eskom has been granted an order by the North Gauteng High Court,” says Mantshantsha.
