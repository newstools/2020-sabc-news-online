Police in the Western Cape are investigating the motive behind an attack, in which six people were shot and killed in Khayelitsha, on the Cape Flats. Seven others, including a six-year-old girl, were wounded. Police Spokesperson Novela Potelwa says tragedy struck after an armed group stormed a house and randomly opened fire. “Indications are that it is a household where people live, there were reports that it is a tavern. One thing we know and we have gathered from police in Khayelitsha is that a year ago it was a tavern and they closed it down and currently it was not operating as a tavern but people would gather and enjoy themselves and we are informed that there was a party at the place last night,” Potelwa says. A manhunt for those involved is under way. Meanwhile, Parliament’s Police Portfolio Committee Chairperson Tina Joemat-Petterson has described the Khayelitsha deaths as horrific. She has called on members of the community to co-operate with the police to ensure that criminals are removed from society.
