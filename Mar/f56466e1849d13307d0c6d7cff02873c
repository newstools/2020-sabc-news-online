The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga has suspended all ANC branch general meetings following reports of violence at several provincial meetings over the weekend. Two people were killed in separate incidents. In Ermelo, a member was stabbed to death while another one died after being assaulted at a meeting in Kabokweni near White River. The police are investigating two murder and two attempted murder cases. The provincial ANC says it has suspended the branch general meetings pending reports from regions. “We got reports from various structures, various regions that there are people that are disrupting the meetings and that in certain areas they are militarising our meetings we decided that we must just suspend the meetings for just some few days. On Friday the PEC will make a final assessment and then we can make a clear decision as to what will happen ,says Mpumalanga’s ANC acting chairperson, Mandla Ndlovu. Last month, in the video below, SABC News reported about factionalism in ANC Mpumalanga.
