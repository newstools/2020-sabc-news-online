The murder case of a 57- year-old father who allegedly physically assaulted and killed his daughter, has been postponed to April 11. The accused is yet to make a formal bail application in the Protea Magistrate’s court in Soweto. The four-year-old succumbed to her injuries shortly after she was admitted to the Chiawelo Clinic last Sunday. The accused made a brief appearance in court on Monday. Proceedings were postponed to next Wednesday for him to make submissions why it’s in the interest of justice to be released on bail. He was arrested last Sunday. Four-year-old Mmatsoere Tsoerenyane will be laid to rest in Limpopo this weekend.
