President Cyril Ramaphosa says the recession comes as no surprise given the country’s numerous economic challenges.  He says Eskom’s electricity supply issues presented the biggest stumbling block for the economy. Ramaphosa’s comments come on the back of figures released by Statistics South Africa which revealed that the country has fallen into a technical recession. Stats SA figures have revealed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased by 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019, following a contraction of 0.8% in the third quarter of 2019.  This is the second recession under Ramaphosa’s Presidency since 2018. Ramaphosa was addressing the South African National Editors Forum in Cape Town.  The President says, “Now the poor growth figures for the last quarter are not pleasing but at the same time they could not have come as a shock or a surprise because the signs were there.  And the drivers to this lack of growth and this technical recession that we’re in now, have been there for all of us to see. The load shedding and the impact that it has had on production both at the manufacturing level as well as with trade agriculture slumped down the greatest but I think more importantly, business and consumer confidence has been negatively affected as well.” South African Institute of Race Relations’ Economist Ian Cruickshanks says crediting rating agency Moody’s did say that if the South African economy slips into recession it will be downgraded. Moody’s is the only rating agency that has not lowered the country’s status to sub-investment grade.  Later this month Moody’s will release its latest assessment of the country.
