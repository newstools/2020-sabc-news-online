President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to address the nation on the outcome and decisions of a special Cabinet meeting regarding the Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Sunday at 6pm. The total number of infected cases now stands at 51.                 In a statement on Saturday, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said the meeting will explore ways of intensifying the country’s response to the outbreak.
