Some, like Somalia, are fighting insurgencies while others, such as South Sudan, have high levels of malnutrition, malaria and other diseases that make populations vulnerable to infection. Meanwhile, Kenya has announced that schooling has been suspended with effect from Monday to avoid the spread of COVID-19. This follows the confirmation of two more cases of the deadly coronavirus – bringing to three the total number of confirmed cases in the East African nation. Kenya confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on Friday – a 27 year old woman who travelled from the US through London. “President Kenyatta has also announced the suspension of public gatherings whether funerals, weddings, church services.
