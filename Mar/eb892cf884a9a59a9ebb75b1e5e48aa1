The Health Department says it is anticipating more positive results from the group of people who returned from Italy. This after a third positive coronavirus case was confirmed in KwaZulu-Natal. The patient is the wife of the man in Hilton, outside Pietermaritzburg who was the first confirmed case. The man and his wife were part of a group of ten people who travelled to Italy. Nine members of the group returned to South Africa on March the first. The department’s Deputy Director-General Anban Pillay says:”We anticipate further positive results because the city that they were in Italy was one of the high prevalence areas in Italy where the coronavirus outbreak was quite high.” “It’s not surprising that many of them who had visited that area have tested positive.
