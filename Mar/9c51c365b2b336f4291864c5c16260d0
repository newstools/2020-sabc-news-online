The packages were labelled with a quote from Nelson Mandela. The World Food Programme has offered to assist in logistics and distribution because of its vast experience. South Africa, like other countries in Africa, will receive a total of 20 000 test kits, 100 000 medical masks and 1000 protective suits and face shields.
