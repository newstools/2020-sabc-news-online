The North West Health Department has intercepted and impounded a Limpopo bound bus transporting Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) students. The bus traveled on the first day of the 21-day national lockdown, from Cape Town through the Northern Cape, until it was intercepted in Mahikeng in the North West. Other students had already been dropped off in the Northern Cape. The two drivers are being questioned by the police. MEC for Health in the North West, Madoda Sambatha, says, “The bus has gone to the police for formal statements. But what we have enforced is that the bus can no longer proceed to Polokwane. “As the provincial department of health in the North West we have already spoken with the MEC of health in Limpopo to make arrangements for the kids of Limpopo to be transported.” In the video below Dr. Phophi Ramathuba is addressing the issue of those that disobey the 21 day lockdown:  President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a nationwide lockdown to battle the spread of the coronavirus. The President also announced further measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus. All restaurants, cafes, bars, coffee shops have been ordered to close during the 21 day nationwide lockdown – as they are not deemed as essential services.
