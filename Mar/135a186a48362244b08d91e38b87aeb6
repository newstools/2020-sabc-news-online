Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says he is concerned about the high level of misinformation on social media and fake news about coronavirus (COVID-19) which might lead to unnecessary public panic. The minister addressed the media at Cowan House Pre-prep School in Hilton, outside Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal after a parent at the school was on Thursday confirmed as the country’s first case of coronavirus. The 38-year-old man arrived in the country in March 1. Mkhize says those who were in close proximity to the man on the flight that came from Italy via Dubai to King Shaka International Airport will also be tested. “We must stop spreading fake news that either ridicules the efforts of the health worker or that frighten people or send stories around.” “You get people who now are experts on COVID-19. They tell you that coronavirus has been confirmed in their village and others have got coronavirus that have been confirmed by friends on WhatsApp. All of those kinds of things are not helping South Africa.” Health Minister giving an update on the country’s state of readiness to handle the coronavirus:  Meeting at Cowan House Earlier Minister Mkhize had a closed meeting with parents of pupil at Cowan House Pre-prep School in Hilton, outside Pietermaritzburg.
