KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says despite the country’s sluggish economy, the province has managed to attract investments and create jobs.  Zikalala has been delivering his State of the Province’s Address in Pietermaritzburg.   According to Zikalala, the investment commitments to the province are starting to bear fruit. “Unemployment figures released paint a grim picture of our economy where 29.1% of the working-age people remain jobless at a time when our population continues to grow. Despite this, we are encouraged that we are one of four provinces that show employment growth with a net gain of 39 000 jobs. We are encouraged by expressions of confidence shown by the private sector companies in relocating or settling in the province. These include Samsung Electronics which relocated from Johannesburg to Durban and Heineken which is opening a new plant in the province.” The province has created a Job Creation War Room to address unemployment challenges and drive job creation. Zikalala says that the province will be opening a new state-of-the-art R2.8 billion hospital this financial year. The Dr Pixley Ka Isaka Seme Memorial Hospital is set to benefit areas such as Inanda and Ntuzuma KwaMashu.  In the document below is the full KZN SOPA delivered by Premier Sihle Zikalala.
