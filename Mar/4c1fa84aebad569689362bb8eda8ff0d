The Democratic Alliance (DA) is likely to interdict the dissolution of the Tshwane Metro council and placing the metro under administration. The party says it has not been formally notified of the decision, announced by the Gauteng government on Thursday. DA mayoral candidate Rendall William says: “We have obtained legal advice and will in all probability interdict the dissolution of the municipality.” The DA’s crying foul saying Premier David Makhura and Human Settlements, Urban Planning and CoGTA MEC Lebogang Maile used their political muscle to affect the decision, rather than valid service delivery concerns.  The DA also alleges that they disregarded the constitution in reaching the decision. It insists that not all regulations and complying processes have been followed. Rendall William says: “The official letter to CoGTA minister for consideration has not been served on the DA or the municipality. If the NCOP rejects the decision then the DA remains in power. Maile and Makhura are riding roughshod over our constitution and democracy.” Despite the Tshwane Council being dissolved by Makhura, the DA is adamant that the status quo remains. “It’s business as usual for us, the status quo stays and all councillors remain. We can even call council meetings, as we stand now the council is still in process.” The party has urged all its councillors to fight the decision.
