Eskom says power cuts of up to 4 000 megawatts will last until Friday. This after breakdowns at generating units, including at the Koeberg nuclear plant. The power utility has, however, warned that cuts may continue into the weekend as the system is constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable.  Eskom has been battling repeated faults at its coal-fired power stations that have prompted severe power cuts and negatively affected economic growth. Koeberg, outside Cape Town, is South Africa’s only nuclear power station and has two units with a capacity of around 1 900 megawatts. Eskom disconnected one of the units at Koeberg yesterday because of a fault with the plant’s turbine system. Meanwhile, Eskom has been implementing stage four load shedding.
