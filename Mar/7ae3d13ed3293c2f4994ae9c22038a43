Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) says it has intensified its coordinated response to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus at all its airports. But service provided like meter taxi drivers stationed at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg  are already feeling the pinch. On Sunday President Ramaphosa’s announced the travel ban on foreign nationals from high-risk countries. These include Italy, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the United States, United Kingdom, China and Iran from Wednesday 18 March 2020. ACSA says it has implemented strict disinfection and hygiene control procedures at all its airports. This is particularly at arrival gates, buses and all passenger facilitation areas. It’s now asking all passengers to complete a questionnaire before landing to assist with detection and tracing of potential infections from high-risk areas. And with more travellers changing and cancelling travel plans, meter taxi drivers are concerned about the impact of the spread of the COVID-19 on their businesses.
