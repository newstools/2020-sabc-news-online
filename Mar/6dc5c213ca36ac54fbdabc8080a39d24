Heidi Warricker is the CEO of the Fertility Show Africa. “It is estimated that infertility in Africa affects one in six couples and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). We are leading the race internationally which means that in Southern Africa alone there are 8 million people who suffer from infertility which is quite an alarming statistic. The first of its kind fertility show in Africa is taking place this weekend to help open up the fertility conversation to break the silence, to break down the barriers and the taboos.”
