Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says the total number of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases increased by 13 since Saturday reaching 51. Mkhize says in a statement that 7 new cases have been confirmed in Gauteng, 5 in the Western Cape and one in KwaZulu-Natal.    Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Sunday chair an urgent meeting of Cabinet that will discuss ways to limit the spread of the coronavirus from travellers coming into the country.  There are expectations that Ramaphosa may address travel restrictions given the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases. Cabinet may further consider a recommendation that South Africans returning from high risk countries be in quarantine for 14 days. CONTRALESA calls for urgent dialogue The National Heritage Council and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa, CONTRALESA, are calling for an urgent dialogue with Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize over worries about whether information about coronavirus is reaching rural communities. They have called for urgent Awareness Campaigns on the outbreak in all official languages. CONTRALESA briefed the media in Pretoria. Secretary General Chief Zolani Mkhiva says rural communities have been left out. “We feel that the communication cannot only be communicated in English because it might take longer to reach the people in the jurisdiction of traditional leadership. Therefore as this leadership we want to assist government in terms of communicating with speed. We are therefore taking a view that we want to meet as soon as possible with the Minister of health so that we can engage with him and advice him in ensuring that this process is simplified.” The infographic illustrate how to reduce risk of coronavirus infection
