Limpopo Health MEC, Dr. Phophi Ramathuba, has sent a stark warning to those who disobey the national lockdown regulations – saying authorities will not hesitate to take action against them. This after a man – who tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) – was arrested at a village outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. The man tested positive in Gauteng and – instead of going into self-isolation – went to his home village. He was traced by a team, with the help of the provincial Health Department and the police. South Africa has 1170 coronavirus cases and one death. Ramathuba has appealed for people to be disciplined amid the 21-day lockdown. “We know our situation. The only way we can beat this virus is if we go towards compulsory screening for any suspect and compulsory quarantine of anyone who would have tested while waiting for the results – and the compulsory isolation. If we do that as a province, that is how we are going to win this battle. I am not going to lie to the people of South Africa and say if we have people who are sick, we will be able to provide them with that which is necessary. Because dealing with the coronavirus, we have seen even first world countries struggling. “ In the video below Dr. Phophi Ramathuba is addressing the issue of those that disobey: Arrests made
