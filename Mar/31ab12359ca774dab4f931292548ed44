The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng says it is confident that the High Court in Pretoria will overturn the provincial government’s decision to place the City of Tshwane under administration. Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning and CoGTA Lebogang Maile announced a team of administrators, who takes over power immediately in Pretoria. The provincial government resolved to dissolve the council after numerous meetings failed to sit since last November. DA Caucus leader in Gauteng, John Moodey, says Maile’s action will be proven to be a futile exercise when the court sits on Tuesday. “We personally believe that is an abuse of authority and therefore tomorrow our case will be heard in court. And I have no doubt the court will find in our favour and set this process aside and reinstate the city to what it was. And the merits of the case will be argued further on in two months on,” says Moodey. In this video, DA’s John Moodey says the DA is seeking legal counsel on the dissolution of Tshwane
