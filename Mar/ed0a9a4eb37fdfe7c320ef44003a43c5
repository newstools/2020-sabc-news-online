An investigating officer attached to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has been fatally shot during a robbery at his house at Jakkalsdans in Cullinan, Pretoria. A group of men arrived at Mandla Mahlangu’s plot in the early hours and pointed a gun at him and a worker. The suspects shot Mahlangu and fled – taking his white bakkie and some household items. The Gauteng Provincial Investigation Unit is investigating robbery as a possible motive. No arrests have as yet been made. IPID says it cannot divulge any further information on the incident as it may jeopardise the investigation.
