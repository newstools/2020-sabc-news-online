Two lanes have now been opened to traffic on the M1 Highway, near Corlette Drive in Johannesburg after the highway was closed due to a fatal shooting incident. A 35-year-old man was killed in his luxury German car. Metro Police Spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar says traffic remains backed up despite the reopening of the two lanes. “The body has now been removed from the crime scene on M1 north at Corlette Drive. There are now two lanes open to traffic. However, traffic is still extremely heavy and we want to advise motorists to avoid the M1 north when going past Corlette … the tail end as far as Oxford Road off ramp. Motorists can use alternative routes; the N1, and the N3 as alternate routes.” Minnaar says the motive is not known. Minnaar has urged motorists to use alternative routes.
