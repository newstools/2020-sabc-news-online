Trade union Nehawu will challenge the suspension of workers for dereliction of duty at the Beit Bridge border post in Musina, Limpopo. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced that officials would be suspended following reports that travellers were not being tested for coronavirus and other illnesses at the border post. Nehawu secretary in Limpopo, Jacob Adams says the suspensions are unfair. “They are still at their work stations, they received letters which intend to suspend them and they must give reasons why they should not be suspended and we are taking up the matter with the national department of health including the provincial department.” “Because it is unfair and it is uncalled for just to suspend members without look or to diagnose what is the real problem at the border post.” On this video, the Limpopo Department of Health raises awareness campaign at the Beit Bridge border post in Musina:
