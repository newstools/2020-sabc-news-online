The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) say the deaths of two people in the Western Cape are an indication of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak. On Friday morning, the national Health Department released a statement confirming the deaths of two people. One at a private hospital and the other at a public health facility. The DA and EFF have expressed sadness at the news, conveying condolences to the families of two women one aged 28 and the other 48. DA interim leader John Steenhuisen says: “If ever there was a reason to reinforce how important it is that over the next 21 days that people abide by the regulations and stay indoors so we can flatten the curve and stop the spread then this must be it. This must serve to focus our minds of just how serious this COVID-19 outbreak is and just what a threat it presents to our nation, our economy and our country.” The EFF agrees. In a statement, the party urges South Africans to stay at home. “We call on all employers that insist on remaining fully operational to desist and shutdown their companies. These unfortunate deaths should be a wake-up call to all of us regarding the gravity of the COVID-19 pandemic, as such we should all be part of preventing its spread.” COVID-19 Safety Precautions by SABC Digital News
The red berets have also urged law enforcement agencies and security forces to carry out their duties with dignity and compassion, respect and care as they patrol the streets of South Africa to make sure that all citizens adhere to the national lockdown rules. More than 1 000 infections have been confirmed in the country so far – making it the most affected African country.
