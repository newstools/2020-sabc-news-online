The Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation says it supports stronger regulations announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. In a statement the foundation says it supports the establishment of a public/private sector fund to help South Africa save lives and support the economy, the preparation of quarantine centres, measures to support small businesses and imposition of a stay-at-home. The foundation says, “These measure are indicative of decisive leadership when the country needs it most. The generous donation of seed funding to the special COVID-19 fund by some of South Africa’s most successful business families is wonderful affirmation of the human family that we are.” On Monday night Ramaphosa announced that the country will be on a nation wide lockdown for 21 days as of Thursday Midnight. Political parties in the National Assembly backed the national lockdown.

Now it is here, and the number of infections is growing, said the foundation. It also called for South Africans to reach across the inequity which divides us, saying “We are because of others; we cannot do it on our own.”  Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize confirmed that the number of cases in South Africa has rose to 402 an increase of 128 cases in just one day from Sunday figures.
