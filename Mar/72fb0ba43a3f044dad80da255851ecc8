Eskom says the likelihood of load shedding today has increased significantly and this could continue throughout the weekend. It says this follows multiple generation unit trips overnight. The power utility’s Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshatsha, says they have lost seven power stations due to various technical faults which are being investigated. “We lost seven generating units at four power stations due to various technical faults. The root causes of these incidents are being investigated and collective measures to be implemented. These have caused additional strains to our reserve capacity. It has reduced our reserve capacity and we may, this evening and throughout the weekend, go ahead and implement load shedding if there’s no improvement in the generation system performance,” says Mantshatsha. Last month, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) called on Eskom to takes South Africans seriously and provides them with electricity. Malema led a large crowd of EFF supporters on a march through Sandton to hand over a memorandum of grievances to Eskom CEO Andre De Ryter at the headquarters in SunningHill, north of Johannesburg. The crowd gathered at the power utility’s headquarters, after a 4-hour walk from Sandton. Malema appealed to all those who have the means to pay their electricity bills, or else face prosecution.
