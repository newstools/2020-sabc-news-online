African Christian Democratic Party  (ACDP) leader, Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, has given a message of optimism amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, saying the country will overcome the pandemic. This after Meshoe and Steve Swart both ACDP MPs tested positive for COVID-19. Meshoe took a test on Sunday after coming into contact with five international guests who tested positive for the coronavirus – following a religious gathering in Bloemfontein. In the video below, Meshoe says he is feeling strong mentally and is praying.  Authorities are trying to trace 500 other people who attended the event. Well-known pastor Angus Buchan and his wife – who attended the event – have also tested positive. South Africa has 1170 coronavirus cases and one death. Meshoe says he is self-isolating from his wife at home. “People need to understand that life goes ahead, flu comes and goes, that is the position that I am. People will see how we react and hear that we are strong and that if they are attacked they will take courage in what we are saying and be strong themselves.” Last week, Meshoe attended a meeting in Parliament along with President Cyril Ramaphosa and other political parties. Ramaphosa tests negative for COVID-19 Ramaphosa went for testing as a precautionary measure upon the advice of his physicians earlier in the week and received his results on Wednesday night. As Head of State and Chair of the National Command Council, Ramaphosa has a rigorous public engagement schedule. In the last few weeks, he has held numerous meetings with people from all walks of life. The Presidency has deemed it necessary to make the test results public to reassure the nation that he is in good health. Meshoe says, so far, he is not showing any symptoms of the virus.
