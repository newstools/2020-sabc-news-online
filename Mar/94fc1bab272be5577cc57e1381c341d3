Eskom says due to an improvement in generating capacity, load shedding will be downgraded to Stage 1 for the remainder of the day until 11 pm on Saturday evening. On Friday, the power utility downgraded Stage 4 power outages to Stage 3 and said load shedding would revert to Stage 2 on Saturday. South Africa has endured almost a week of Stage-4 power outages after Unit 1 of nuclear power station Koeberg, tripped. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the unit has now been repaired and has returned to the power grid. He adds that they managed to recoup adequate emergency reserve supply. “We have synchronised Koeberg generation unit one back into the grid safely so and this has helped improve the generation system performance and increased capacity. our emergency reserves have adequately recovered and we are in good shape for now,” says Mantshantsha.
