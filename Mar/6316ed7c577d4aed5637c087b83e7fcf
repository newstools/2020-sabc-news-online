Gauteng Premier David Makhura says fixing the countryâ€™s education system has to start with the foundation phase. He was speaking at the inaugural primary school summit in Randburg, north of Johannesburg, where the provincial Education Department for the first time released the performance results of all primary schools.  This is aimed at strengthening and improving the performance of all learners in primary schools. Makhura says research shows that there are major gaps in the foundation phase of the schooling system.  He says it does not help to be the best performing province when it comes to matric results, while little attention is being paid to the lower grades. The Premier says primary school teachers will be retrained as one of the measures of improving results. He says if children are well taught while still young, and with the introduction of technology-related subjects, this will benefit the country in the long run.
