Dis-Chem Pharmacies says it will be limiting the number of items consumers can purchase with immediate effect. It was reacting to government’s call on citizens to refrain from excessive buying and stockpiling goods as the coronavirus spreads. Dis-Chem says shoppers will be able to purchase a maximum of six units of any given item throughout Dis-Chem’s store network to minimise the impact of panic buying.  As the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in South Africa continues to rise, store shelves are running empty as scores of people rush to buy supplies in bulk.
