The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says it has made provisions to pay grants to older persons and persons with disabilities earlier this month – to help avoid crowds of people gathering at social grant pay points. This as South Africa has reported 274 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with no deaths. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi, has called on beneficiaries to refrain from rushing to receive their grant money as it could lead to large crowd gatherings – and a potential further spread of the coronavirus. “On March 30th and 31st, we will be paying old age grants and disability grants respectively and all other forms of grant will be paid on the first of April as normal. Together with the SA Post Office, we have agreed that there must be more cash payment machines so that we don’t have more than 100 people at one place,” explains Letsatsi. “People can go to the banks, all machines and so on to get their money. We are appealing to our beneficiaries not to go to these places on the 1st April. People can go on any other day and they will be able to get their money safely in their account,” adds Letsatsi.
