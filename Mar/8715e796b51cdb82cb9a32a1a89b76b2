Stage 1 load shedding will resume at seven on Sunday morning. Eskom says in a statement that improved generation and low weekend demand has allowed for the reduction from last week’s stage four load shedding. The cash strapped power utility says nuclear plant, Koeberg’s Unit One has been safely synchronised onto the grid and this has helped increase generation capacity and ease the scale of load shedding. Unit 1 tripped last week forcing Eskom to implement stage four. Eskom has a virtual monopoly in power generation and relies on many aging coal fired plants to generate electricity. Its new plants, Kusile and Medupi have been plagued with problems. South Africa has endured almost a week of Stage-4 power outages after Unit 1 of nuclear power station Koeberg, tripped. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha adds that they managed to recoup adequate emergency reserve supply. “We have synchronised Koeberg generation unit one back into the grid safely so and this has helped improve the generation system performance and increased capacity. our emergency reserves have adequately recovered and we are in good shape for now,” says Mantshantsha.
