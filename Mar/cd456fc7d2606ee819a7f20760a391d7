Screening of the coronavirus has been discontinued at the Beitbridge border post in Musina in Limpopo. The provincial Health Department has since referred the SABC to the national department on the issue. Some travellers say they are concerned about a lack of screening. “I’m from Zimbabwe but they never screened me for this coronavirus hey. I’m worried but I don’t know what is going on that side…I just passed and from there I’m going home,” says one traveller. Another traveller says: “Today there were no people screening. Even with the foot and mouth disease here, there were no people screening. We should be worried. But isn’t that thing only in Asia? But we should be worried because this is the port of entry; we should be worried though.” Screening continued for a week last month after the provincial Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba paid a visit to the border and assessed screening.

The organisation has also expressed concern over the country’s capacity to place a large number of people under quarantine; as some South African expatriates in Wuhan are to come back home.
