The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) has appealed to public transport operators to decrease fares following the drop of the fuel price. The petrol price will decrease by 19 cent a litre at midnight on Tuesday, with the diesel price set to drop by 54 cents. “We are calling on all on the retail stores, everybody who have been transporting food to also decrease the price of food and to make sure that the consumers benefit from that 19 cent decrease of the price of petrol,” says Saftu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi. A steady decline in the international oil price has been attributed to the cut in petrol prices.
