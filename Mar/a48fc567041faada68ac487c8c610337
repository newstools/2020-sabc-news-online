In the video below, more than 100 South African citizens are confirmed to be evacuated from China  Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu says people should contact government if they know of any other South Africans in Wuhan. Zulu who is a member of the inter-ministerial committee was speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg on Sunday. “I think what is also important here is of us to make a call to our citizens overall that if there’s a family anywhere that has people that we are not aware of it becomes their responsibility to get in touch with government.” The inter-ministerial committee says no decision has been taken to extend the repatriation of South Africans to other parts of China. International Relations Department’s Chris Chetty has urged South Africans to make contact with Dirco if they know of any other family members in China. “We want to urge the South Africans to please make contact with Dirco in terms of family members of South Africans they know that are in China, in particular Wuhan city.” In the video below, the inter-ministerial committee briefed the media on the Covid-19 situation in South Africa at the OR Tambo International Airport on Sunday.
