Gauteng Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo says Allandale road towards Kyalami in Midrand will be officially closed from Monday the 16th as it undergoes major rehabilitation. A section of the road has been deteriorating due to underground water. The road is expected to be closed for three months. Mamabolo was addressing the media in Midrand. “Starting just on this Monday, 16 March 2020, the parties will immediately commence with the construction of the bypass while the road remains open to road users. We however wish to caution road users to fully cooperate with the process of road maintenance and rehabilitation. The contractor will work extra hours to complete the work expeditiously.” In the video below Gauteng Transport MEC briefs media on the planned closure of Allandale Road:
