Coronavirus infections in Japan topped 2 000 cases on Tuesday, according to a Reuters calculation based on ministry data and media reports. A centre for disabled people in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, found seven more infections on Tuesday, bringing the total there to 93, Kyodo News reported. Elsewhere, more infections were found in Ehime, Fukui, Kagawa, and Tokushima prefectures, as well as in a doctor and nurse in Tokyo’s cancer research hospital, according to Kyodo and public broadcaster NHK. Meanwhile, Japan has urged its citizens not to travel to 73 countries and regions, or a third of all countries in the world, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said on Tuesday, as the government fights to prevent an explosive surge in coronavirus cases. The ministry on Tuesday issued “Level 3” travel warnings against the United States, Canada, China, South Korea, Britain, among others, adding to the more than 20 countries, mostly in Europe, that it had warned against in recent weeks. The government will likely ban entry of non-Japanese nationals from the newly added countries, as it has for the previous ones, Motegi said.
