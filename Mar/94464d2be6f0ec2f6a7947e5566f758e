Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize says two South Africans who were treated for the coronavirus after contracting it on board a ship, are free to return home. He says the two will not be evacuated, as they are dealing with the 185 South Africans who have been living in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pair, who had been working on the Diamond Princess in Japan, tested positive for COVID-19 last month. Mkhize says there’s only one confirmed case of coronavirus in the country. “But everything is on course as far as we’re concerned with those members who will be coming back. It’s important to say to South Africans that those people are not infected. We just want to take a precaution because they have to come back. When they do come back, we will keep them in quarantine for 14 days thereafter we’ll test them and make sure that when they go out into the community, they’re fine. There are those on the Diamond Princess ship, the two that were found to be positive. They went for treatment and we were assured that they are now well they must get onto commercial flights and come back,” says Mkhize.
