Western Cape Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo says the process of tracing all the contacts of the three positive coronavirus cases in the province is underway. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Friday announced another eight new confirmed cases in South Africa – bringing the total to 24. Mbombo says all the cases had travelled abroad recently. One of them is a parent at the private United Herzlia Schools in Cape Town. The school’s eight campuses have been closed until the end of the school holidays on 31 March. Mbombo says it’s important for people to practice basic principles of hygiene. “So far in the Western Cape 134 have tested and 3 have been confirmed – two today and one previously. Today the Western Cape, the City and other stakeholders, we have to engage because the people ask us: Do we cancel events, Easter weekend church events, schools transport? So the premier will release in terms of the response,” says Mbombo.

Teaching at the schools will continue remotely from Monday to Friday in order to minimise learning disruption.
