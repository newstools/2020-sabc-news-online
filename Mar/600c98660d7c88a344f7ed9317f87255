Western Cape Community Safety Minister Albert Fritz has tabled an increased budget of more than R800 million for the year 2020 and 2021. Spokesperson Cayla Tomas Murray says the budget, which has been increased by more than 100% will boost the province’s safety plan. Among the key allocations is an additional R11 million to expand Chrysalis Academy and the allocation of over R1 billion in the next three years to the City of Cape Town’s Law Enforcement Advancement Plan. Tomas Murray says R1.2 million has been allocated towards the review of the legislative framework on the retail and sale of liquor. This is in order to reduce alcohol related violent crimes and domestic violence. “Minister Fritz said studies have shown that alcohol abuse, among other substances, is a key driver of interpersonal violence and murder. As a province, we have a constitutional obligation to regulate the liquor industry and this is something we must address. The review of legislation is to ensure your safety.”
