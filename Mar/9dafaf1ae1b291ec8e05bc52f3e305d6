The Eastern Cape Health Department says two helicopters and more ambulances have been dispatched to the area between Centane and Butterworth where 21 people, mostly pensioners, have been killed in a bus crash. The bus crashed near Thafalofefe Hospital in the early hours of Monday morning. It is believed that 79 passengers were on board when the crash occurred. In the video below SABC journalist Yanga Funani reports on the latest: They were on their way to shop in Butterworth. The cause of the accident is still unclear and Department officials say the South African National Defence Force will also assist with the rescue mission. The Department’s Sizwe Kupelo says the bus is lying in a ravine. “Our helicopters cannot land directly at the scene. So, they remain on standby to fly patients to various hospitals. We have alerted hospitals around to get beds to accommodate the patients that have been carried from the scene.”  Meanwhile, 17 people have died in three separate road crashes in Limpopo this past weekend. In the latest incident, seven people died on Sunday night when a vehicle collided with a truck on the N1 in Musina. In another incident, five others were burnt beyond recognition during a head-on collision involving two light vehicles on the N1 near Mokopane on Friday afternoon. Limpopo Transport Spokesperson, Joel Seabi says the remaining five died on the R25 outside Moutse. “The loss of 17 lives out of only 3 accidents that occurred in just one weekend is quite horrible and tragic to this effect. MEC Masemola sends his heartfelt condolences to the affected families. Two of these accidents happened on the N1 and one on the R25 area of Moutse.”
