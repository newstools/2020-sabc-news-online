Deputy Minister of Justice John Jeffrey has condemned social media comments that discriminate against South Africans who are being repatriated from China in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. He has been speaking during a launch of the South Africa’s Human Rights Plan to address stigma and discrimination against people affected by HIV and TB in Sandton. In the video below, Dr Reginah Osih explains how coronavirus could possibly impact those living with HIV and TB:  More than 120 expats are expected to arrive in the country on Saturday morning. Jeffrey has reiterated that the privacy of the patients and affected families should be respected. “I think we all saw those prejudices and fears in relation to HIV/AIDS in the past and we are also seeing them now with coronavirus.” The infographic below tells of living conditions for SA repatriates under quarantine:  Meanwhile, eight more cases of the COVID-19 infection have been recorded in South Africa, bringing the total to 24. Of the new cases, Gauteng registered four, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape each registering two more cases. They range between the ages of 21 and 79 years old. All new patients had travelled overseas to countries such as Switzerland, Austria, Greece and Italy. More than 128 000 people have been diagnosed in 118 countries across the globe, with at least 4600 deaths. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, addressing the media in Limpopo, has said all persons who came into contact with the new patients are being traced. “The patients have now been informed and their contacts are being traced at this moment. The doctors are managing the patients and we will give you more details if there are any new developments at this point,” says Mkhize.
