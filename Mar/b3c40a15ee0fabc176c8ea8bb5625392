Unions at South African Airways (SAA) have confirmed that they have received a section 189 notice to start the process of consultation that could result in the cutting of 2 200 jobs. The process will affect SAA and not subsidiaries Mango, SAA Technical and Air Chefs. One of the unions at SAA, the National Transport Movement (NTM), has urged government to absorb any workers who may be retrenched – in order to preserve jobs. NTM President, Mashudu Raphetha says they don’t anticipate such a high number of job cuts.
