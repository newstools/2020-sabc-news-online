The African National Congress (ANC)’s National Youth Task Team says it’s optimistic that the League elective conference will take place in May. The ANCYL conference, which was expected to take place in March, was last week postponed due to provinces and regions that reportedly failed to submit their membership due to what the task team called “gate-keeping”. The task team was appointed by the ANC’s national executive committee last year after the disbandment of the League’s national structure. Team coordinator, Sibongile Besani believes that they are on course in delivering the congress:  Besani says: “We are aware that there may be things that are beyond our control but where we are in terms of preparations we’ve worked on the venues we’ve worked on the preparations for the BGM’s and AGM’s.” “We are also working on other areas of logistics that require finances and so on. We are working very hard to meet that deadline. In fact, we have set ourselves the dates of the 28 to the 31 of May for the congress of the ANCYL.” On this video below, ANC Youth League postpones its May elective conference:  The ANC has been without a youth voice for a year since the disbandment of the Youth League. The ANCYL conference has been postponed for the third time since 2018. Political Analyst Steven Friedman believes the void left by the defunct league poses a huge risk for the mother body. “The absence of a functional youth league is a crisis for the ANC. If you look at the ANC at the moment, there isn’t a youth leadership coming through and it’s not surprising. The youth league has not been functioning for quite a long time. This is a management problem by the ANC. The situation is that after Julius Malema and other members left the youth league in a very weakened state. The ANC leadership had the option of quite quickly getting the youth league back to a situation where it could elect new leaders and get back on its feet again. They didn’t do that.”
