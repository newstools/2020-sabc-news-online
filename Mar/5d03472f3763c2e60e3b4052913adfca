Former Prasa Board Chairperson Popo Molefe has told the State Capture Inquiry in Johannesburg how then President Jacob Zuma directly interfered with internal Prasa affairs. Molefe says he received an invitation through a private G-mail account from former Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe. Molefe says he was worried that protocol was ignored and the subject matter for the meeting request was to do with Prasa affairs. Molefe was giving testimony about governance failures at Prasa when he was board chair. He says Zuma dismissed his concerns and became irate at the meeting telling him that he (Zuma) could meet anyone he wanted to without following protocol. “At that time, I didn’t realise anything related to the request and I thought the former president says he will come and meet me, but the subsequent events put one in the position of connecting the dots, because the meeting came shortly after my meeting with Montana where he had a lot of complaints.” Earlier, Molefe detailed to the commission how Montana worked his way to the top eventually becoming the CEO for the now cash-strapped SOE. The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg also heard evidence of how former minister Jeff Radebe allegedly helped propel former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana to the top of the organisation. Molefe detailed how Montana was given the responsibility to own the taxi recapitalisation program under the Department of Transport. On this video below, Popo Molefe implicates Lucky Montana:
