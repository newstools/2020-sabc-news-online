The Eskom board has acknowledged receipt of correspondence on allegations of corruption and victimisation against its Chief Operating Officer, Jan Oberholzer. Corruption Watch and the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) are calling on the Eskom board to intervene and act to protect whistle-blowers. Both organisations are referring to an Eskom employee, who has since deposed an affidavit to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Spokesperson Sikonathi Matshantsha says Eskom has taken urgent steps to address these allegations. “Eskom has previously dealt with matters concerning the employee in question; the investigation was closed following a thorough examination of the allegations, to which no substance was found. However, in light of the new allegations including the alleged abuse of power, the Board of Eskom has taken urgent steps to address these allegations in a transparent process.” Below is an Eskom board statement on allegations against Oberholzer:
