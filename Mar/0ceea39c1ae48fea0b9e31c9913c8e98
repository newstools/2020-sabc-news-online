Non-governmental organizations, Gift of the Givers, has called on South Africans to unite and fight the spread of the coronavirus in the country. The NGO has begun implementing a number of measures to aid government in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The organisation has set up a testing facility in Mayfair, Johannesburg, to offer COVID-19 testing at a reduced rate to all patients who meet the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) criteria. Other two facilities will be opened in Roshnee and at The Dome in Johannesburg. Gift of the Givers on Monday will erect tents at three hospitals in Johannesburg to separate suspected COVID-19 infected patients from the medical staff and the general public as they wait to get tested. Gift of the Givers founder, Imitiaz Sooliman says, “Anybody who’s prepared to volunteer to help us at the dome in Johannesburg at the hospital in Durban or our sites in Roshnee are most welcome to call in. They can call our toll free line 0800 786 911.” The map below tracks coronavirus cases across the world:  Below is a handwashing challenge, demonstrating how to keep your hands clean to stay safe:
