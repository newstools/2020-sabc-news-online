The Economic Freedom Fighters in the North West is demanding the removal of a police officer in the cases of Bloemhof community members arrested for allegedly fighting gangsterism in the area. The demand was made during a community march led by both the EFF provincial and regional leadership, to the local police station and Magistrate’s Court. 44 people were arrested between February and November last year. The majority of them are members of the organisation called the Bloemhof Anti-Gangsterism and Crime Prevention Forum. The charges against them include intimidation, murder, public violence and kidnapping. EFF provincial secretary, Papiki Babuile leading the march says, “The police officer who is investigating this case, there is a case opened against him also by the same people that he is investigating. And as a result, we believe that there is a conflict of interest because we can’t allocate a case to a person that the same people have people opened a case against. We are saying the man must be removed from the case and a competent person be appointed to investigate the matter.” Acting Station Commander, Captain Schalk van Heerden received the memorandum. “I listened to your demands. I will take this up with management and within 14 days we will give feedback to you. Thank you very much.” In the video below, residents in Bloemhof march against crime
