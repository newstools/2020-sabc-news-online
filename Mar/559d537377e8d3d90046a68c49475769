The South African government has imposed a travel ban on at least 8 countries including the UK and the US to stop their citizens from visiting South Africa. This comes in the wake of the global spread of the coronavirus and the decision by the South African government to declare the pandemic a national disaster. Transport Minister, Fikele Mbalula says the restrictions that include the revoking of visas to at least 8 000 Chinese citizens will be gazetted on Wednesday when the travel bans start.

It’s not only South Africa that has imposed a ban. Many countries across the world have done that. In this instance, we have restricted it to certain countries’ travel restrictions to the currently identified high-risk countries including South Korea, Italy, Spain, Iran, Germany, United States of America, United Kingdom and China.”
