The North West MEC for Health, Madoda Sambatha, is calling for a review of self-isolation measures. This after three people who tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) were tracked down by the police and health officials after failing to comply. “This issue of self-quarantine has to be reviewed, because you say to people self-quarantine and you give them strict measures. “When you go and check them you find them not in the condition that you have prescribed for them and it is a danger to spread the virus across the province.” The MEC says the number of infections in the North West has increased from five, but could not give the figures, saying they must first be verified before being made public. Patient arrested in Limpopo On Saturday, a man who tested positive for the coronavirus was arrested at a village outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. Limpopo Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba, says the man tested positive in Gauteng and, instead of self-isolation, he went back to his home village outside Tzaneen. He was found by the tracer team, with the help of the provincial health department and the police. The department says it won’t hesitate to take action against anyone who breaks the rules.  The health department says the number of people infected with the coronavirus are 11 87. The Gauteng province has the highest number of infections with 533 followed by Western Cape with 271. Some health workers have also been infected. The department says a 70-year-old doctor in the Free State is in ICU.
