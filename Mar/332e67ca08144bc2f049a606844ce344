The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) has launched an online campaign to gather information around the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be better prepared for the epidemic. The council says it expects that individuals, communities, and businesses will be affected by the progression of this disease. They are now looking for input from South Africans that can access the survey online. As of Saturday, some 1187 South Africans have been infected by the new coronavirus. The United States now has more than 124 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 10 000 people in Italy have died from the disease. In the video below is a discussion on how the US is responding to the lockdown:  To take part in the survey, go to the HSRCâ€™s page on surveymonkey. The council says no personal information will be recorded and answers to the questions are anonymous. The South African Human Rights Commission says it is concerned by the devastating impact of the coronavirus: In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, the South African government declared a national state of emergency on March 15, 2020. Measures included the partial closure of borders, the closing of schools and prohibitions on events involving more than 100 people gathering.
