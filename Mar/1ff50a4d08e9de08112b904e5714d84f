Ten people have died and 15 injured after a bus transporting passengers from Centane to Butterworth in the Eastern Cape crashed near Thafalofefe Hospital earlier on Monday. The passengers, mostly pensioners, were on their way to shop in Butterworth. The bus was travelling from the Mazeppa Bay area. The cause of the crash is still unclear. Chief Phathuxolo Tyhali from the Amathole House of Traditional Leaders says the bus was travelling down a steep hill when the driver lost control of it. “The road is bad because emergency services must come all the way from Butterworth 100 kilometres away. Yes, it went down, rolled and rolled. I don’t know how many times. It’s not a good thing at all, because some of the relatives and children are crying now because their parents were travelling to Butterworth.”   Seven killed in a collision between a car and truck in Limpopo In another collision, seven people have been killed between a car and a truck in Musina, Limpopo.
