Judgment in the case between the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and Public Protector Busiswe Mkhwebane will be delivered in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Monday morning. SARS made a submission to the court to apply for an order declaring that the Public Protectorâ€™s subpoena powers do not extend to taxpayer records. This relates to an investigation by Mkhwebane involving former president Jacob Zuma. Mkhwebane is investigating a 2017 complaint by the Democratic Alliance (DA) that Zuma allegedly received an undeclared R1 million from a security company during the first four months of his presidency. SARS has approached the High Court asking it to set aside the subpoena issued by Mkhwebane in order for her to access tax information of Zuma. SARS has also asked that Mkhwebane pay for a percentage of the costs should she lose. In the video below, political analyst Levy Ndou weigh in on the SARS and Mkhwebane matter:
