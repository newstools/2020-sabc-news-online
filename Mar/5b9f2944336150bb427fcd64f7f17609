Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago on Thursday announced an interest rate cut of 100 basis points, to 5.25% per annum, as South Africa moves to combat the severe economic effects of the coronavirus. The cut follows a three-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). This pushes down the prime lending rate by banks to 8.75%.  Kganyago says the impact of the coronavirus could be softened by lower oil prices. He says inflation is expected to be muted. However, he says South Africa’s economy is expected to contract by 0.2% in 2020. The Reserve Bank Governor argues that lower inflation and suppressed economic growth has necessitated rate-cutting. He says the central bank has room to move.
