On Sunday, the total number of confirmed cases was at 274 which means there has been an increase of 128 cases in a day. The Northern Cape has also confirmed its first case on the virus, which has been declared a global pandemic.  Gauteng has the largest number of cases with 207 followed by the Western Cape at 100 and KwaZulu-Natal at 60. President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to address the nation Monday evening on increased efforts to fight the pandemic and deal with its effects.

The Ministry says details of the high rise in confirmed cases will be explained during the briefing by President Cyril Ramaphosa later today. It will also give details on the ongoing investigations of contact tracking and testing processes in each province.
