A civil society initiative, #OperationCovid19, has started its campaign to distribute 1 million bars of soap to deserving communities over the next two weeks. The initiative kicked off in Diepsloot.  The SABC visited the community of Diepsloot and found that there is a lot of issues pertaining to access to water, posing a challenge to efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa. The World Health Organisations has, among other things, advised people to sanitize and wash their hands with soap regularly. It is for this reason that civil societies such as Operation South Africa have undertook the campaign to hand out bars of soap to Diepsloot. Gauteng Premier David Makhura, who has joined the initiative, says that government needs to mobilise all sectors of society to curb the spread of COVID-19. “We need to mobilise businesses; like in this case, business people have been able to make these bar soaps available. We need to mobilise community action groups like the community action group that has brought us here from Laudium that has mobilised volunteers; that is why volunteers are wearing masks because those who volunteer to work must be protected like the health workers must be protected. We will only succeed if we really join hands together.” However, the move has received a lot of criticism on social media. The EFF’s Head of political education, Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, accused the initiative of posing a risk to communities that have so far not registered any case of COVID-19.
