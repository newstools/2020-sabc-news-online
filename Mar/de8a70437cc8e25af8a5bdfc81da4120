The Cape Chamber of Commerce has called for the suspension of rates and rents to save jobs and small businesses in light of the national lockdown. President of the Chamber Geoff Jacobs says small businesses are already hard hit by the impact of COVID-19. He’s called on municipalities and landlords to grant property owners and tenants some breathing space by suspending payments for the duration of the lockdown. Jacobs says Stellenbosch Municipality has already agreed to suspend rates. Stiff fines loom against retailers hiking prices Retailers found guilty of price-hiking during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa could be fined 10% of their annual turnover. The National Consumer Commission is currently investigating 11 retailers and businesses for unjustified price increases due to the demand for goods ahead of the national lockdown. Director of Prosecutions at the Commission Joseph Selolo says consumers must report retailers or even local shops if they feel prices are being unfairly hiked. “There’s a penalty that can be imposed which is 1 million or 10% of the offenders annual turnover whichever is greater. Unfortunately, we do not have enough man power that we can go to each shop but we encourage consumers as soon as they see that, to lodge a complaint with us together with the competition commission so that then we can take action and try to bring those offenders to book,” Selolo says. Consumers are urged to report price irregularities during this time at 0800 01 4880.
