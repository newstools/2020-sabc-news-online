Eskom says it does not expect to implement load shedding on Monday. It, however, says the power generation system remains constrained and vulnerable. The power utility says it is utilising emergency generation reserves to supplement supply during peak hours. Eskom says the possibility that load shedding may be implemented at short notice remains high should the system performance deteriorate. It had implemented load shedding last week. It ranged between stages one and four.  The cash-strapped power utility says nuclear plant has a virtual monopoly in power generation and relies on many aging coal fired plants to generate electricity. Its new plants, Kusile and Medupi, have been plagued with problems.
