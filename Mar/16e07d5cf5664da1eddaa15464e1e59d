South Africans, residing in the Chinese city of Wuhan, say they’re waiting in anticipation for communication from the government – on details of when and how they will be evacuated from the region. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has been tasked with repatriating 184 South Africans from Wuhan – the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. A South African working in Wuhan, Sizwe Sibiya, says they’re expecting to be notified soon on the evacuation process. “We were told initially that it would take about 10-days for the whole process to be finalised and then we will be taken back home. We are hoping that in the next 12-24 hours – if they stick to the timeline that they gave us. The suspense is killing us, we can’t wait. The past three weeks have been a total lockdown. You can’t get out of your immediate community, you have to rely on deliveries and we have to rely on people bringing food for us.” Audio: China-based South African Sizwe Sibiya speaks to Stephen Grootes in a telephonic interview:   In the video below, South African citizens in Wuhan asking to be repatriated:  The number of infections worldwide has increased to more than 107 000 with about 3600 deaths.
