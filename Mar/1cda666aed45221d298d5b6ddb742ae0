Government says they have noted with concern a number of confirmed COVID-19 cases of health workers who work both in the private and public hospitals. This includes doctor and nurses. The health workers are exposed not only to their families but to the patients who they are meant to treat. Government says South Africa received a very limited stock of flu vaccines and the medication is pre ordered a year in advance.
At the time the country placed its orders, they had not anticipated the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that as it stands, the flu vaccines is understocked. The South African government engaged with the pharmaceutical industry and it became clear that the distribution of the vaccine has to be rationalised and prioritised. However all the health workers are reported to be in good medical condition with most of them having mild or no symptoms.
It is reported that there’s only one doctor in the Free State aged 70, who is in ICU. The South African government says as from Saturday the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases inreased to 1187.
