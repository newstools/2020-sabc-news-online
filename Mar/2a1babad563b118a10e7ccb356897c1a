The North West Health Department says it has already started tracing people who may have been in contact with the five patients who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). The province’s COVID-19 cases stand at five. It recorded its first cases on Monday. The infected people, whose ages range between 21 and 68, are currently stable and under self-quarantine. One of them had visited some European countries. Health MEC Madoda Sambatha addressed a media briefing in Mahikeng. “All four cases were tested in private facilities. The fourth patient from Bloemhof is said to have attended a Bloemfontein church. Also, there’s a 21-year-old female she was in contact with visitors from European countries. North West has one extra, so we have five confirmed cases,” explains Sambatha. Number of confirmed Covid-19 cases rises in Limpopo Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba says the three people who tested positive for coronavirus, while in self-isolation on a farm in Lephalale, had returned from Europe. Ramathuba says this has increased the number of provincial cases to four. The province has not yet recorded a local transmission as all four cases have a travel history to Europe. Ramathuba says the family of three is originally from the Western Cape. She has urged individuals in provinces like Gauteng and the Western Cape to limit movements to other provinces.
