MEC for Community Safety in Gauteng Faith Mazibuko has given law enforcement agencies in Elsburg, east of Johannesburg, seven days to compile a report on the issue of drugs in the area. This after the community expressed dissatisfaction with police work in the area during a joint meeting with the MEC.  Elsburg residents accused the police of not doing enough to curb the drug scourge in the area. They have also called for the removal of the station commander. The community wants a satellite police station in the community since their station was moved from Elsburg to Wadeville, almost four kilometres away. Residents say the station is not easily accessible to them and they feel unsafe since it was moved in April 2020. Meanwhile, Ward Councilor in Elburg Alta de Beer says their efforts to rid the community of drugs have not yielded any results. “On a daily basis, I get at least about 20 complaints, because the people here are really tired. The elderly people, phone me and they say they cannot walk on the streets it’s too dangerous. I’ve got mothers of children that phone me to say we can see these people standing here. We can see the police arrive there but nothing happens. We can see that money moves hands between cars and people that are walking up to the cars but nothing happens to them,” De Beer says. Some community members have also called for the Tactical Response Team to deal with the drug scourge. Mazibuko says she will engage Minister of Police Bheki Cele regarding allegations of corruption within the police service. She also called on the Liquor Board and the MEC for Economic Development to scrutinise the issuing of liquor licenses after residents raised concerns over the use of illegal licenses.
