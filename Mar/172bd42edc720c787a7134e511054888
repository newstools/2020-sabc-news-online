The second witness in the Pastor Timothy Omotoso rape trial underway at the Port Elizabeth High Court has accused him of luring her into his bedroom. Lerato Msibi says his first interaction with Omotoso was at a hotel in Secunda after a church crusade. She says the second time was at the mission house in Mhlanga. Similar to a previous witness, Msibi says the sexual assault started with her massaging his feet, then he would order her to lie down and sexually please himself. Thereafter, he prayed for forgiveness. Msibi says she felt confused. She told the court that she joined the Jesus Dominion International Church because of the miracles pastor Omotoso was performing. Msibi was homeless at the time and suffered from a heart condition. She told the court how she was coerced to join the church. Msibi detailed how the girls in the church would kneel between his legs to greet him. Some of the girls then helped him to change clothes. She was given money to buy clothes. Later Omotoso asked her to join him for a walk in the hotel garden. She told him she wanted a home and to be healed. She wanted him to be her father. He then assured her not to worry as she is his now. Msibi also got emotional as she testified about her first alleged sexual encounter when she was called to Omotoso’s room. Omotoso and co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho face a total of 97 charges between them. This video below gives a detailed summary of the witness’ cross-examination:
