The patient, who tested positive for coronavirus in Gauteng, has been discharged from the Charlotte Maxeke hospital in Johannesburg. However, authorities say she will continue to self-isolate. A total of 7 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in South Africa – six in Kwazulu Natal and one in Gauteng. The Gauteng woman was part of the same travel group to Italy as South Africa’s first case of COVID-19 who was diagnosed in KwaZulu-Natal earlier this week. The Health Minister Zweli Mkhize confirmed last week that the 39-year old woman had direct contact with the man from Hilton in KwaZulu-Natal who tested positive for coronavirus. The video below shows progress of Gauteng patient who tested positive for coronavirus:  Booking  and screening of patients The South African Medical Association (SAMA) also advised General Practitioners and other healthcare professionals to develop new ways of booking and screening patients suspected of being infected with the coronavirus to avoid its further spread. SAMA says having measures in place to book patients before they arrive at the practice will also prevent other patients from getting infected. SAMA Chairperson, Angelique Coetzee explains, “The problem arises because you, as a GP, don’t know the type of patient that is making an appointment at your surgery. Even if you know that they may have complained of colds and flu, you still don’t know whether it’s a real cold or flu or whether this is part of the coronavirus.” Charlotte Maxeke hospital is one of three dedicated facilities in Gauteng for the treatment and isolation of conronavirus cases.
