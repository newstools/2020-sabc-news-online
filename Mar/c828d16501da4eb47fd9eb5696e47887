Eskom says technicians are working on tracing the cause of the trip at the nuclear power station, Koeberg outside Cape Town, that has forced the implementation of Stage 4 load shedding. Eskom ramped up Stage 4 from 2 Tuesday afternoon. Eskom says in a statement that the tripped unit remains safe and teams are investigating the cause of the fault. The cash-strapped power utility says in a statement that the tripped unit remains safe. Eskom says the national grid is still constrained and has appealed to consumers to save as much electricity as possible. Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha says,  “We have lost 930 megawatts units at Koeberg power station in Cape Town. There is absolutely no nuclear risk. This is limited to the turbine on the generation side so we are implementing load shedding, Stage 4. And this has put additional strain on the already strained generation fleet.” Eskom spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha explains:  On Monday Eskom warned that it will implement Stage 1 load shedding from 9 o’clock in the morning until Thursday.  The power utility has attributed the decision to an increase in the number of unplanned breakdowns at its power stations.
