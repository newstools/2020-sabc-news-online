The National Freedom Party has expressed concern about those who are travelling to rural areas during the national lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a three-week national lockdown starting from Thursday midnight. NFP National Secretary-General Canaan Mdletshe says most people in the cities will travel to spend their lockdown in their rural homesteads. “This is a big problem because it might spread the virus.” “We are concerned more, especially for those who are in Gauteng because Gauteng currently is the leading province in the number of people infected with the coronavirus. The movement of people from Gauteng to Umsinga, Nongoma etc. is going to create the possibility of spreading the virus. That’s what concerns us the most and we are urging people to stay indoors.” In the video below, SABC Reporter Nosipho Mncube reports from the Wanderers Taxi Rank in Johannesburg:  Mdletshe also says that hospitals will not be able to cope if the coronavirus spreads to rural areas. “Our rural people, as much as they have the relevant information, they don’t have the means to mitigate this virus. We have got many people who are unemployed relying on social grants. Those people instead of buying a sanitizer they will rather buy a loaf of bread to eat. “That is why we are worried and concerned that should the people from cities move to rural areas this virus will spread rapidly and our health system is not going to cope.” In the video below, SABC Reporter Mike Maringa is on the N1:
