The South African Local Government Association (Salga) says municipal authorities who resign from their positions after being implicated in the alleged corrupt activities will be forced to pay back the money. Salga president, Thembi Nkadimeng, says the funds received by the municipalities should be accounted for as they are meant to deliver services to the communities. Nkadimeng was speaking at the end of a two-day national executive committee meeting held in Polokwane, Limpopo. “In cases of corruption, a person resigns and then moves forward. For example, Fetakgomo municipality, the former MM resigned after getting a salary and after having been suspended for 10 months. And when she’s supposed to take disciplinary hearing she resigned. Our resolution as Salga here is that we want the money paid back and we’ll assist the municipality to take legal action against that municipal manager and we begin to be seen to be taking action.” In the video below, Salga briefed the media last month on the parlous state of municipalities.
