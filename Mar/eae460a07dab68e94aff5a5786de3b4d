Two Wits University students have failed in their bid to interdict the immediate closure of student residences. The High court in Johannesburg dismissed the urgent application on Thursday. Students Lerato Moela and Matsobane Matlhwana wanted to stop the university from evacuating residences due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.   Their application followed Monday’s decision by Wits to evacuate residences and undertake early recess after a student tested positive for COVID-19. The student attended class for two days before going under self-quarantine. The student had come into contact with another person who tested positive for the virus that has claimed almost 9 000 lives globally. In the video below, is a report on the Wits medical student who has gone under quarantine:  Wits Vice-Chancellor Professor Adam Habib says the ruling has vindicated the institution. “The judge implored the applicants and all other students to comply with the directives of the President, the World Health Organisation and the NICD. The judge recognised that the University is following the directives of these bodies. We are pleased with the outcome of the court proceedings and we believe that the judgment is a vindication of decision-making informed by scientific evidence. It also allows institutions to act decisively and to work with government to manage and mitigate against this pandemic.”
