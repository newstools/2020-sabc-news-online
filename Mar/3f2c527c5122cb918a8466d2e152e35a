As the country battles the spread of the coronavirus with over 1000 cases and two reported deaths, there is some good news from the Automobile Association (AA) with the biggest fuel price drop on record. The AA predicts unleaded 95-octane petrol is set for a reduction of R2.18, 93-octane by R2.05. Both grades of diesel are expected to fall by around R1.65 with illuminating paraffin down R1.98.  The fuel price will be adjusted next Wednesday, April 1. AA Spokesperson Layton Beard says world economies are retreating due to the coronavirus pandemic… “The crude oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia continues unabated, with demand for oil further suppressed as world economies retreat due to the coronavirus pandemic. Obviously, the fuel levies announced by the finance minister come into play in April. Those are 25 cents combined, but will do little to dent the decreases that we are expecting going into the new month.”
