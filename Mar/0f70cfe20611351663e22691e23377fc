The Mo Ibrahim Foundation has announced that, for a second year running, it has not found a suitable winner for its annual Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership. The award, launched in 2006 recognises former African leaders who have shown “outstanding governance of their country and brought peace, stability and prosperity to their people”. The winner receives a 5 million US dollar cash award. The first winner was Mozambique’s former President Joaquim Chissano in 2007. Other winners include Festus Mogae of Botswana in 2008 and Ellen Sirleaf Johnson of Liberia in 2017. “Africa is facing some of the toughest challenges in the world – ranging from those connected to population growth, and economic development, to environmental impact. We need leaders who can govern democratically and translate these challenges into opportunities. With two-thirds of our citizens now living in better-governed countries than ten years ago, we are making progress. I am optimistic that we will have the opportunity to award this Prize to a worthy candidate soon,” says Dr Ibrahim who is the Chairman of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was given an honorary award in 2007.
