Zimbabwe has recorded its first coronavirus death. One of the two confirmed cases in the country, Zororo Makamba, has died in hospital. He had returned from the United States (US) earlier this month via Johannesburg.  The Health Ministry confirmed the death via its official Twitter page. Last week, Zimbabwe declared a national state of disaster. The news of Zororo Makamaba’s reached social media before the Health Ministry’s announcement.
