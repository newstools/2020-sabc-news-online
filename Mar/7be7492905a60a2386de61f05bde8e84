The African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina has extended support to African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) leader Kenneth Meshoe and his Deputy Steve Swart after they tested positive for the coronavirus. Both are MPs. Meshoe revealed his status and that of Swart after receiving their results. Meshoe took a test after coming into contact with five international guests who tested positive for the coronavirus following a religious gathering in Bloemfontein in February. In this video below, SABC News reports Reverend Kenneth Meshoe and his deputy Steve Swart have tested positive for COVID-19: Almost 500 people attended the church event and authorities are trying to trace them. Pemmy Majodina says, “We want to pledge our wavering support to them. It’s good that the leaders have come upfront and declare their status, because it would send a clear message to say nobody is  immune to testing positive to COVID-19.” “Therefore, were are expected, all of us, to exercise all precautionary measures where possible so that we are safe. But these two members, they are going to recover fully. We put them in our prayers, but they have our wavering support.” Last week, Meshoe attended a meeting in Parliament along with President Cyril Ramaphosa and other political parties. Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko said all protocols with regards to tracing and testing for the COVID-19 pandemic will be followed for everyone without exception. Meshoe says, so far, he is not showing any symptoms of the virus. More than 1000 people in South Africa have tested positive for the coronavirus. South Africa earlier confirmed its first two fatalities from the virus, two women in the Western Cape.
