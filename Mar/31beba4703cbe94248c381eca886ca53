The Rural Doctors Association of Southern Africa (RuDASA) has expressed concern over hospitals in rural areas, not having enough equipment and resources to attend to the possibility of a high number of coronavirus cases. South Africa has 1170 coronavirus infections and one death. RuDASA’s Dr Lungi Hobe, says there is already a shortage of medical staff in rural areas. “The rural population basically accounts for about 42% of healthcare services and we only have 15% of doctors looking after rural care and 20% of nurses. This poses a major concern for us in terms of human resources. It has always been a major issue but now with COVID-19, it’s going to be a particularly major issue.” This comes after the Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu, announced that the number of coronavirus infections now stands at 1170 and the death toll is one person.
