The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee member Lindiwe Sisulu says there is a need to teach ANC branches the real politics of the governing party and do away with factions. Sisulu was addressing ANC members in Khayelitsha, outside Cape Town, ahead of the party’s provincial conference that is scheduled before the end of 2020. Sisulu says the ANC has dropped the ball over the past years and embroiled itself in factional battles. “Well, we made so many mistakes and those are the things we need to talk about, especially the ANC do believe that and renewal is one of those beginnings,” she says. At the same time, ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule was scheduled to address another meeting in the city.
