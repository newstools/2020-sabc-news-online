Calm has returned to Barberton, Mpumalanga, after a month of violent protests. Most schools and shops, however, remain closed. The community has been demanding the reversal of a merger between Mbombela and Umjindi municipalities. Residents claim that service delivery has suffered since the merge.  Angry residents on Wednesday burnt a community hall, offices of the ANC and a municipal pay-point building. Last week, two trucks and a light vehicle were also set alight. In the video below, Barberton residents demand the separation of Mbombela and Umjindi municipalities:  Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga says it will take major steps against all municipalities that are failing to deliver services to communities. The party says the provision of services has collapsed in municipalities, forcing communities to embark on protests. Residents have mixed feelings that the ANC will be able to root-out the infighting and corruption that have paralysed service delivery.  “The ANC acknowledges that there are political battles in some municipalities thus affecting the delivery of basic services. The party says it will remind councillors that they are deployed in the municipalities to service communities, not themselves,” says the ANC’s Acting Provincial Secretary, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali. The party’s provincial elective conference is scheduled to take place by the end of March.
