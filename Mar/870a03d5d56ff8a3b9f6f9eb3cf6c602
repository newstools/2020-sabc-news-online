Liberation struggle hero Dr Alfred Bathini Xuma will be re-buried at his home village of Manzana in Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape on Sunday. Dr Xuma passed away in January 1962 in Johannesburg and was buried in the Brixton cemetery in Johannesburg. The presidency has declared a Special Official Funeral Category 1 for his burial. Dr Xuma was the first black South African to become a medical doctor. He attained his education with the aid of supportive white Americans who gave rise to his enduring belief in multi-racial partnerships and propelled him to become an advocate of racial integration and equal medical education for Africans. He dedicated his entire life to justice and humanity. Subsequently, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Luthuli in Gold for his exceptional contribution to the struggle for freedom and against colonialism on the African continent. The presidency has ordered the national flag to fly at half-mast until Sunday evening.
