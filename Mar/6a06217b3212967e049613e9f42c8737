President Cyril Ramaphosa says men have the responsibility to help secure the future of women. He was speaking in Tweeling in the Free State to mark International Women’s Day. This year’s theme is “I am Generation Equality”. Gender-based violence and unfair labour practices mean that many women are forced onto the fringes of society. Ramaphosa has called on men to teach their children to respect women “A thousand young boys were brought together, I’m told that they told sad stories sad stories of absent fathers, sad stories of yes being abused and I call on the men of our country fathers of children of our country as a man and as a father be there for your boy so that we inculcate in our young men respect for women,” says Ramaphosa. President Cyril Ramaphosa delivery keynote address on International Women’s Day:  International Women’s Day is aligned with UN Women’s new multi-generational campaign, which marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, where heads of state committed to ensuring gender equality in their countries end. Head of UN Women in South Africa, Anne Shongwe says they urge governments to accelerate action to ensure that gender equality is achieved. “Its six key areas that are still lagging behind, gender based violence is one, economic justice and rights is the second one, leadership and feminist movements, climate justice, bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive rights, technology and innovation.” “These are areas that are outstanding, along with the social norms and stereotypes otherwise known as patriarchy which holds us back all the time in every institution. We expect dramatic and accelerated change.”
