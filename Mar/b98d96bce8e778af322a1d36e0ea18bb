Some South Africans in areas including Alexandra have been defiant to the orders government has given during the national shutdown.  Five people in quarantine in the high density township after coming into contact with a person infected with the coronavirus.   In the video below, SABC News looks at the situation in Alexandra:  Police Minister, Bheki Cele, says 2000 people have been arrested across the country for non-compliance with the lockdown regulations since Friday.  Cele accompanied by his Deputy and National Police Commissioner visited different pension pay-points in the KwaMashu and Inanda townships, north of Durban.
