The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has shelved all scheduled by-elections in the country in a bid to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The affected elections include those which were meant to be held on Wednesday in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape. “People may have not turned up at the voting stations, participation level would have been low, and so in those circumstances, a free and fair election would have been significantly affected,” says IEC Chief Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo. Eight provinces have outstanding by-elections.

Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says, given the scale of the coronavirus challenge, it is understandable why most countries activated their disaster management laws. He believes this will help in coordinating national response to the pandemic. “We have a disease; people need to understand it severely affects their civil liberty; it affects movement, the right to vote at this pointing time it’s going to be suppressed.” Meanwhile, the IEC says the 2021 municipal poll might also be moved to a later date, should the situation not improve.
