A family of a woman trapped in another area of the coronavirus outbreak in China has expressed grave concerns over the government’s decision to only repatriate South Africans in Wuhan. The inter-ministerial committee tasked with processing the evacuation of South Africans in coronavirus-hit Wuhan, on Sunday detailed how this process will work. Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize announced that plans to evacuate South African citizens from the coronavirus epicenter of Wuhan city are at an advanced stage. Rami Ramalepe says her sister, who is at Shandong Province in China, has been sick and they are hoping she did not contract the coronavirus. “Our concern basically is the Department of Health, together with Dirco, we are not really getting the proper response. There are no facilities where she could get tested. We are scared that when she arrives she might infect us with coronavirus or other diseases because she will be traveling.” “She actually raised concerns because there are people infected in the same province where she is. From the South African government, there’s no assistance that we got and it’s very disappointing. It seems as if they do not have plans in place to actually assist all travelers from China.” In the video below, update on the spread of the virus in Asia: Below is a map of the coronavirus cases worldwide as of 28 February 2020:
