South Africans, who are currently on a nationwide lockdown, say they are fearful of the financial implications of not working and thus not being paid for the 21-day period. Despite this, many have found innovative ways to distract themselves from worry and anxiety. A father, Gabrielle Naidoo, says he has spent his lockdown time downloading the grade two syllabus to assist his son with catch up work. “I have mixed emotions right now about how I’m going to survive this pandemic financially but we are trying to stay positive. Day one was rough as we didn’t know what to expect. I went to do my necessary shopping on day one as we only received our salaries on Thursday.” “I stood in a queue for two hours.

We had a fun day drawing and playing with his toys,” adds Naidoo.
