Co-director of the Institute for Economic Justice Neil Coleman has described government’s plan to cut the public sector wage bill as an attempt to pacify the rating agencies. Neil says policy-makers must identify what he terms the real problems in the public service. “We have a dysfunctional strategy that is not thinking through these decisions and is being very short-term in their approach. In a way, the only hope is that generating this crisis is going to be a situation in which policy-makers are forced to engage in realistic alternatives to begin to get the wheels of the economy moving.” In an interview with Morning Live, Neil Coleman discusses the decision to curb the rate at which public sector wages are growing.
