 Eskom has begun implementing stage 2 load shedding. The power utility says power cuts are likely to continue for the rest of the week amid further delays in efforts to return some power stations to service. Eskom has again appealed to consumers to use power sparingly.   Eskom on Monday implemented  stage 1 load shedding from nine o’clock, attributing the decision to an increase in the number of unplanned breakdowns at its power stations. It says the system is currently constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable. Below is a video by Eskom explaining load shedding:  Eskom’s spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says that demand has also incrementally risen since January, putting pressure on their ageing fleet. “This is due to a number of breakdowns which we have experienced over the weekend and late last week, and delays in some of the units were planned to come back to service this week. They’ll now return to service in the course of the week.” “We urge the people of South Africa to cooperate with us and help reduce demand in order to reduce the impact of load shedding.”
