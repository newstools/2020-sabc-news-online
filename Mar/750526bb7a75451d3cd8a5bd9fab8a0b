The City of Tshwane has secured more shelters for scores of homeless people currently accommodated at the Caledonian Stadium in Pretoria. This after numerous complaints of poor water and sanitation facilities at the stadium. Most of the homeless will now be relocated to more suitable buildings as of Tuesday after they were temporarily housed in tents at the Caledonian Stadium, as a measure of curbing the spread of COVID-19. City of Tshwane’s administrator Mpho Nawa explains, “We thought it is important to move people to Hatfield areas and the NG Kerk in Arcadia and UNISA study halls and Laudium here in Tshwane.” ”This should as well ease the crowd to ensure that we respond to that situation to be able to provide tents and matresses so that people are comfortable. Before the end of this week I think we will be monitoring the situation and of course our officials are there.” Meanwhile, five people are in quarantine in the high-density township of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, after coming into contact with a person infected with the coronavirus.
