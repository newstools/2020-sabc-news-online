The Democratic Alliance (DA) has raised concerns over Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile’s failure to take action against African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members for walking out of several council meetings. This follows Premier David Makhura’s announcement to dissolve the Tshwane Council. The decision came amid the City’s leadership crisis – following the resignation of DA Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, last month. The acting city manager, Makgorometje Makgata’s three-month contract has also ended. Makhura says an administrator will be appointed to run the Tshwane Municipality until a new council is elected within 90 days. Gauteng DA leader, John Moodey says, “It didn’t come as a surprise to us. We realised what they were up to as early as the first meeting in December where they tried to get an illegitimate Speaker appointed and conduct that meeting. What is of concern was the fact that the MEC did not take the initiative to act against councillors who deliberately collapsed council meetings – because their walkouts and failure to attend the meetings were on frivolous grounds saying the Speaker was the problem when in fact the Speaker has never been the problem, she has acted in accordance with the law.” In the video below, Makhura cites some of the reasons behind the Gauteng government’s decision:  Moodey has questioned why no action has been taken against ANC and EFF members, who disrupted council meetings. “We will not bow down and be intimidated by the EFF or ANC and that is why we will be taking this matter of placing under administration of Tshwane to our legal advisors. We are already busy with it and seek senior council’s opinion and if we have a case. We will take this matter to court for review. If we do not have a case, we are prepared to go to a by-election because the people will have a say on which government they want,” adds Moodey.
