Despite the ban announced by the eThekwini Municipality prohibiting bathing and surfing at all Durban beaches to curb the spread of coronavirus, many local beachgoers still took the risk. Historically, thousands of people flock to the Durban Beach Front on public holidays such a Human Rights Day, but the numbers were considerably smaller on Saturday given the current restrictions. The municipality has indicated that although bathing is banned, the public is still allowed to jog or take walks along the golden mile. Beach-goers say it is riskier to go to shopping malls than to the beach. “There is nothing else to do so at the moment. There is little of an escape. You can’t really take it away. It’s here and it is one time where people are not really going to listen,” says a beachgoers. Another beachgoers says, “As a person who grew up in beachfront, we swim each and everyday. Well, coronavirus might affect us by contacting people, but when you are in the water how I can get it? Yes, I can see the poles written no swimming, but you just want to go swim. It’s a hot afternoon.” In this video, SABC News reports that confirmed coronavirus case in SA rise to 240:  In this video, Minister Zweli Mkhize discusses measures placed against coronavirus: President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on South Africans to practice social distancing to minimise the risk of contracting the virus.
