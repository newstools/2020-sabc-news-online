Gauteng Police Commissioner Elias Mawela says so far 148 people have been arrested and another 25 people issued with warnings for flouting the lockdown regulations in the province. Gauteng has registered the most number of COVID-19 cases in the country with 584. The total number of infections in South Africa is at 1 280, with two deaths.  The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has been deployed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to assist police during the lockdown and ensure adherence. However,  Mawela says there are still those who continue to disobey the law. “We are going to apply zero tolerance to those people who are disregarding the regulations. Those people who continue to trade in liquor, those who continue to participate in social gatherings, street bashes, chisa nyamas. We want to call upon them to say please let them respect and recognise the regulations and abide with those, ” says Mawela.
