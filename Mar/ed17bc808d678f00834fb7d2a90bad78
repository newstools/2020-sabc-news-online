Former African National Congress (ANC) deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe has urged members of the party to remain loyal to the organisation. Motlanthe delivered a memorial lecture on the late struggle stalwart Raymond Mhlaba in Bethlehem, in the Free State, on Friday. He has described Raymond Mhlaba as a selfless and unwavering member of the party. Motlanthe has told ANC members that the organisation faced many challenges during apartheid but Mhlaba remained loyal to the party. He has encouraged members to learn from Mhlaba. “It is critically important to take a leaf on how Raymond Mhlaba worked; how he conducted himself, and the manner in which he seriously combined the duties of the various structures in which he brought.” In the video below, former deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe says Raymond Mhlaba was one of the consistent revolutionary in the struggle for freedom in South Africa :  Motlanthe has told members to work for the party and not for personal gain. “The ANC and alliance leaders at all levels must be prepared to take extraordinary steps for the betterment of our people, do work not for personal gain, but for the improvement of our localities, communities and societies. ANC and alliance leaders must volunteer and sacrifice to do community work. Not merely for elections.” Motlanthe has urged ANC branches to carry out the party’s mandate.
