The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West has expressed disappointment over the removal of the Mayor of the Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality which includes Bloemhof and Christiana. Kagiso Palagangwe was removed through a vote of no confidence. The motion was tabled by the Forum For Service Delivery which accused Palagangwe of corruption and maladministration. Prior to the voting process, four ANC councillors staged a walk out. The ANC has condemned the action. Co-ordinator for the ANC Interim Provincial Committee Hlomane Chauke says the party will also investigate allegations levelled against Palagangwe. “We condemned corruption, if there is corruption there – we must bring stability. It means that action has to be taken against that particular mayor and then the ANC must bring the house in order again and is a process. If found that he is guilty, then the ANC has no option but to remove him and then begin with the process of replacement,” says Chauke.
