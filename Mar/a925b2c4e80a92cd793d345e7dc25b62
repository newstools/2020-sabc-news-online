The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is threatening to launch a campaign under the #Ramaphosa-Must-Go if government decides to sell Eskom power stations to private bidders. Ramaphosa indicated his willingness to sell power stations that would otherwise be decommissioned during an address to journalists earlier this week. EFF spokesperson Delisile Ngwenya says if power generating units are sold off to private companies to generate power, they will mobilise rolling mass action in all provinces.  Meawhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa says that government is focusing on fixing the countryâ€™s public finances. Reflecting on the national budget that Finance Minister Tito Mboweni delivered in Febraury, Ramaphosa says in his weekly letter that South Africa was in a precarious and unsustainable situation in which spending outstripped earning, attracting rising debt servicing costs.
