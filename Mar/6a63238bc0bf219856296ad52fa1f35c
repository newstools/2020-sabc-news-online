The City of Cape Town has called on national government to refine the regulations of the 21-day lockdown to make implementation easier for the police and military. The City says currently any person found on the street may plausibly claim to be out for the purposes of shopping for food. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith says it is therefore impossible for law enforcement agencies to truthfully determine whether a person is entitled to be on the street or not. Smith says, “The city is therefore calling for the national government to amend the regulations to limit the hours of shopping at shopping malls as well as spaza and tuck shops to the hours of 9 am to 1 pm daily or some other provision in the regulations to make regulations more helpful for the police to be able to improve the situation on the streets.” In the video below, SABC News looks at the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa:  Citizens worried about financial implications of lockdown South Africans, who are currently on a nationwide lockdown, say they are fearful of the financial implications of not working and thus not being paid for the 21-day period. Despite this, many have found innovative ways to distract themselves from worry and anxiety. A father, Gabrielle Naidoo, says he has spent his lockdown time downloading the grade two syllabus to assist his son with catch up work. “I have mixed emotions right now about how I’m going to survive this pandemic financially but we are trying to stay positive. Day one was rough as we didn’t know what to expect. I went to do my necessary shopping on day one as we only received our salaries on Thursday.” “I stood in a queue for two hours. On day 2, we enjoyed family time that we don’t normally enjoy with our busy jobs. I downloaded the grade 2 syllabus for my son and we did school work. We had a fun day drawing and playing with his toys,” adds Naidoo. In the video below, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation:
