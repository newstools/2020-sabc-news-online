The University has temporarily disabled the biometric access system at all seven campuses and 29 residences. South Africa has three confirmed cases of the coronavirus. UP staff and students will now use cards to scan in and out at all entrances. Vice-Chancellor Tawana Kupe says, “We are also now looking at other measures, that we can take. You can for example in buildings or spaces where people enter – for example, lifts. We’ll have to find a solution for that.
