Leader of the ACDP Reverend Kenneth Moshoehas tested for coronavirus and is awaiting the results. This after five international tourists, with whom he attended a church service in Bloemfontein earlier this month, tested positive. Meshoe has dismissed reports that he had tested positive for the virus. In the video below, Moshoe says his test results will only be available in about four days:  He says, “They say it takes two to three days to get the results. The officials that were there made some very positive comments, ‘you do not show any symptoms of being infected.’ I’m not surprised if this thing was started by somebody who hates me and who hopes that I will be positive and maybe even die. You can call me after four days to talk about it.”  On Wednesday, Meshoe attended a meeting in Parliament along with President Cyril Ramaphosa and other political parties. Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko says all protocols with regards to tracing and testing for the COVID-19 pandemic will be followed for everyone without exception. While Moshoe says he is feeling fine, Diko says the Presidency will be monitoring developments. She says, “We will watch the situation around Reverend Moshoe closely and we will be guided again by those protocols should those who were in contact with Reverend Moshoe. Remember, should he test positive for the coronavirus, then immediately it triggers that process where those who were in contact with him are then traced and then themselves asked to subject themselves to self-isolation and then testing.”
