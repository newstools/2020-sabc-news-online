The Congress of the People (COPE) has challenged the president of the ANC and the country, Cyril Ramaphosa, to condemn and distance himself from the statement that ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule made at the weekend. On Sunday in his address to ANC structures in Cape Town, Magashule reiterated his support for the former president of the party and the country Jacob Zuma, saying it was an ANC position. In the video below, Ace Magashule encourages ANC members to support Jacob Zuma.  Magashule also referred to former president F.W. de Klerk’s comments that apartheid was not a crime against humanity and questioned why people could forgive him and not Zuma. De Klerk’s comments led to the EFF calling for him to be removed from Parliament during the State of the Nation Address. He later withdrew the comments and apologised. COPE National Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says Zuma should not be supported as long as corruption allegations against him remain. “It is unacceptable that a person who is facing such a lot of corruption charges must be supported. President Cyril Ramaphosa must put the country first and not his political party. That’s why we are saying he must come clean and distance himself from Magashule and say that he is there for the country and not for his political party.” More than a week ago, several senior ANC members; including ANC members of Parliament Supra Mahumapelo, Mosebenzi Zwane and Joe Maswanganyi, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina and ANC Free State chairperson Sam Mashinini; joined party supporters at OR Tambo International Airport to welcome Zuma back home from Cuba. Zuma, who had reportedly been in Cuba for treatment, will be back in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on May 6 on corruption charges linked to the arms deal.
