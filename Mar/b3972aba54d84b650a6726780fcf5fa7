The State Capture Inquiry has heard that Daniel Mthimkhulu, the fake engineer who fabricated his CV, never produced evidence of his qualification to Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa)‘s Human Resources when he was hired in 2010. Former Board Chair Popo Molefe says Mthimkhulu lied his way to the top of the organisation to become head engineer and was only able to produce fake letters when asked to provide proof of his qualifications. Molefe was giving testimony regarding the procurement of 88 locomotives’ for Prasa. Molefe says the procurement process for those trains was manipulated by former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana and his associates. “The SCA had established that he didn’t have the qualifications and it had arrived at that because, in various ways, Mr. Mthimkhulu had lied about his qualifications. And in one meeting where I sat with him, he produced a letter because I said show us the award that you have qualified and he produced a letter and I said, ‘No, no. The award of a Doctorate is not done in this way.'” In the video below, former Chairperson of the Prasa, Popo Molefe, concludes his testimony.
