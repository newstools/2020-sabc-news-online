Western Cape police say the bodies of two boys aged, 12 and seven, have been found in two separate cases between the reeds on Kronendal Farm in Hout Bay, and in Tulbagh in the Cape Winelands. An investigation is currently underway to determine if it is that of a 12-year-old boy reported missing in the area on Wednesday. Police have not provided further details of the 12-year-old’s disappearance. However, they say a 23-year-old man who was the last seen with him has been arrested.  He is due to appear in the Wynberg Magistrates’ Court on Monday. More details on the police’s investigations are expected to be revealed in court. Meanwhile, the seven-year-old was reported missing after 7 O’Clock on Sunday morning. A search was immediately initiated and his body was found in the bushes on the river bank.  A 53-year-old suspect was later arrested for murder after detectives followed some leads. The man is expected to appear in the Tulbagh Magistrate’s Court soon. Police say more charges could be added as they investigate the case further.
