The South African Medical Association (SAMA) is urging authorities to follow the correct procedure in the quarantining of South Africans who will be returning from China amid the global coronavirus outbreak. The organisation has also expressed concern over the country’s capacity to place a large number of people under quarantine. The remarks come as the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) prepares to repatriate expatriates in Wuhan willing to return home. On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered the evacuation of South Africans in China. At least 151 South Africans, out of the 201 living in the Chinese city of Wuhan, will be back home in about 10 days. SAMA Chairperson Angeligue Coetzee says: “Quarantine area must be in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and all correct procedures must be followed.” “So in this case we are only bringing in people who are not, as far as we know, infected and they will be quarantine at a different place not the same as if you are infected. For the infected people we definitely not either.” Earlier, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize warned against people attempting to gain access to the quarantined zone where South Africans, who will be evacuated from China, will be accommodated. On this video below, Minister Mkhize assures South Africans that the country is ready to contain the situation.
