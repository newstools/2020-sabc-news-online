The Democratic Alliance (DA) has suffered yet another blow in the City of Johannesburg. The party’s caucus leader Funzela Ngobeni has resigned to join the city’s former mayor Herman Mashaba’s People’s Dialogue. Ngobeni was member of the mayoral committee for Finance during Mashaba’s leadership. He also stood as the party’s mayoral candidate, but was defeated by the current mayor Geoff Makhubo. Ngobeni confirmed his resignation from the DA to SABC News. Yes, I sent my resignation this morning. It is effective today (Monday).”  He says he will be joining Herman Mashaba from tomorrow (Tuesday) to help build a party that would challenge the ANC in 2021’s municipal elections. Mashaba says he’s happy to have a person of Ngobeni’s calibre. “Funzi’s responsibility is to go around the country, to set up structures from the ground. By June, we will be forming a new political party.”  DA Gauteng leader John Moody says Ngobeni’s resignation was unexpected. “I am very concerned about the fact that we have lost the person of his stature.” Mashaba resigned as City of Johannesburg Mayor in October following Helen Zille’s appointment as the chairperson of the Democratic Alliance’s Federal Council. He served as Mayor for three years.
