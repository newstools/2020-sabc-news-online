Communications Deputy Minister Pinky Kekana says challenges faced by digital migration hinder the issuing of spectrum. Kekana visited Senekal in the Free State to inspect the Broadcasting Digital Migration. Free State is the first province to switch from analogue to digital. More than 5 000 residents of Senekal have become beneficiaries. Residents say the switch from analogue to digital has come with challenges. Some say poor installation has led to Set-Top boxes losing signal. “Sometimes it loses signal, and then it will say insert card,” laments one resident. Another one says, “I don’t have any challenges and the picture quality is good.” Deputy Minister of Communications, Pinky Kekana says a new installation contractor will be appointed and there will be a local call centre to assist with challenges. “The issue of the availability of the spectrum also depends on the migration. So the must be smooth sailing of these things. There are areas where if we can avail the spectrum quickly certain things among the spectrum will move quickly. We are all hands on the deck and we will be able to make sure South Africa is not left behind.” The inspection of the digital broadcasting migration will be taken to all provinces across the country.
