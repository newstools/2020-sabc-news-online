Concerns continue being raised over the violation of government’s regulations aimed at slowing down the spread of the coronavirus. People in eThekwini and surrounding areas are still ignoring the call by President Cyril Ramaphosa to stay at home for 21 days. This as the number of infections in South African continue to rise, with the total number of infections now standing at 1 187. This figure is expected to increase in the coming days. Dheven Govindasamy from a private security company says he is assisting police to ensure social distancing in queues at busy shopping centres, but people are still ignoring the lockdown protocols. “We’ve been around Merebank, Chatsworth, Isipingo, Umlazi  – the usual story people are standing in queues for groceries at major stores people walking unnecessarily all over but disregarding the call from the president to stay at home, it’s like we South Africans are taking very lightly this coronavirus. Guys are not following the pattern of standing from each other. We South Africans majority of us are taking things for granted,” says Govindasamy. In this video below, we showcase how the lockdown in Alexandra looks like:  Churches heeding the call While some township residents in George, in the Southern Cape, are still not complying with the strict COVID-19 lockdown regulations, churches are heeding the call of keeping their doors closed. The local mall is very busy with shoppers queueing to buy groceries, but the normal Sunday gatherings at churches are not taking place in Thembalethu, Parkdene, Lawaaikamp, Conville and Pacaltsdorp.
