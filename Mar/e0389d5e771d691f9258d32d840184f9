As the number of coronavirus cases increase in Africa, governments are taking action to prevent a full outbreak. Sporting events, conferences and other meetings of large gatherings are being cancelled across the continent due to COVID-19. The total number of positive cases reported so far is 27, the bulk being in Algeria with 17 cases. South Africa, Tunisia and Nigeria all have one confirmed case of the virus each. In Senegal four people have been infected and Egypt has two cases. The virus which started in China in December has killed more than 3 000 people and infected nearly 95 000 others globally. North Africa has become more susceptible to the coronavirus due to their proximity too Europe. Italy, which has the highest number of fatalities outside China is the common country of travel among many of the confirmed African cases. As the number of cases continues rise, large gatherings are being cancelled across the continent. In Cote d’Ivoire, the African CEO Forum has been cancelled. In Senegal, the inaugural Basketball Africa League started date has been moved and the AU’s Africa Capacity Building Foundation has postponed their meeting in Accra. In Morocco, football matches will now proceed without any fans and business conference has been cancelled indefinitely. It seems that meetings that require international travel are being avoided to curb a full outbreak in Africa.
