The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on government to implement a ban on all travel into South Africa from countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus (COVID-19), particularly Europe which has been declared as the new epicentre of the pandemic. The party has also called for all infected patients of the COVID-19 in South Africa to be quarantined by the state, preferably in Robben Island.  South Africa has registered 24 confirmed cases of the virus. 114 South Africans have returned to the country from Wuhan in China, the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. They’re being quarantined for 21 days at a facility outside Polokwane in Limpopo. EFF spokesperson Delisile Ngwenya government needs to act urgently. She says: “A special facility must be immediately identified and prepared for medical care of all persons infected. It is irresponsible and utterly dangerous to allow unmonitored self-quarantine. This did not work in other countries and will obviously not work here. Coronavirus will sweep all over our country with a supersonic speed all because government lacked the courage to quarantine the infected. Finally, we call for a ban on travel from all coronavirus-infected countries, in particular Europe.” Below is a Live Tracking of the cases, death toll and other information, updated daily:
