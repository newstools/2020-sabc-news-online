Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Human Settlements and Co-operative Governance MEC, Lebogang Maile, will be informing the public on the decision taken by the provincial executive council regarding the City of Tshwane’s governance and leadership crisis. The City is facing a leadership conundrum following the resignation of Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa in February.

The briefing will be taking place at the Gauteng Provincial Legislature at 08:00,” says Maile’s Spokesperson, Castro Ngobese.
