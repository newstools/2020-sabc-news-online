Over a 100 people have been left homeless after a fire ripped through Palmiet Road informal settlement at Clare Estate in Durban, in KwaZulu-Natal. It is alleged that a fire broke out in the early hours of Friday morning, just hours after the 21-day lockdown started. Spokesperson of the Darul Ihsan Centre Relief Team Abdus Saeed says people have taken shelter with their neighbours. “After assessments were did, we found approximately 70 shacks were burnt to the ground affecting about 150 people. We’ve provided grocery packs to 68 families.” “Unfortunately at this point in time, there was no arrangements made for them and they were living with their neighbours within the settlement; it’s a huge settlement. The men were already trying to rebuild their homes.” In the audio below, Saeed elaborates on the disaster:  The tragedy comes as South Africans are observing a three-week lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus that’s gripped the world.
