A school in Durban has taken precautionary measures by asking some learners not to attend classes for 14 days.  This after one learner had traveled to Europe. The learner in question has also been in contact with other learners from his school last weekend. Orient Islamic school had issued letters to parents of the learners in question saying that they learnt that five pupils made contact with a pupil who had returned from Europe last Friday. Orient Executive Headmaster Ebrahim Ansur says there is a need for schools to have information about where their children are travelling to – in order to safely prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “The learner has been to a doctor, the doctor has indicated that he has no signs whatsoever of the virus. In addition, the learner also was in contact with five other learners from Orient over the weekend of last week and as a precaution, we’ve asked those learners also to stay at home. As the learner in question did not show any signs and to now has not and has been cleared we’ve asked them to return to school.” This comes after the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a pandemic. The term pandemic relates to a geographic spread and is used to describe a disease that affects a whole country or the entire world.
