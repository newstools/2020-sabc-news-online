Eskom says stage four load shedding will resume at 9am on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, Eskom implemented stage four load shedding after Unit One at nuclear power station Koeberg tripped. It said Unit One was safe and technicians were working on the problem.   Meanwhile, Eskom has welcomed the High Court in Pretoria’s ruling against the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, paving the way for the utility to recover R27 billion from consumers. The court set aside Nersa’s tariff decision and granted Eskom leave to apply to Nersa for additional expenses incurred in the 2018/19 financial year. The cash strapped power utility has said that Nersa’s tariff decisions were one of the major reasons why it was in a financial crisis.
