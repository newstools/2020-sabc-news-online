As the world commemorates International Women’s Day, governments have been challenged to ensure gender equality and gender-based violence end. The 2020 theme is “I am Generation Equality.” It is aligned with UN Women’s new multi-generational campaign, which marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, where heads of state committed to ensuring gender equality in their countries end. Head of UN Women in South Africa, Anne Shongwe says they urge governments to accelerate action to ensure that gender equality is achieved. “Its six key areas that are still lagging behind, gender based violence is one, economic justice and rights is the second one, leadership and feminist movements, climate justice, bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive rights, technology and innovation.” “These are areas that are outstanding, along with the social norms and stereotypes otherwise known as patriarchy which holds us back all the time in every institution. We expect dramatic and accelerated change.”
