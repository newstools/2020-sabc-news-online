Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) workers are staging a sit-in at the Department of Infrastructure offices in Johannesburg, Monday evening. The workers say they received SMSes from the department informing them of the termination of their contracts at the end of March. South African Federation of Trade Unions National Organiser Lebohang Phanyeko says this affects about 5 500 people.  According to Phanyeko, most of the staff have been working for six years in the department. “These are workers that have been working for the department for years, without any benefits. They were expecting to be absorbed and be permanently employed.” Approximately 200 workers are participating in the protest. Phanyeko says they will continue with the protest until their demands are met. The leaders of the workers met with the Department of Infrastructure Gauteng Chief of Staff Bafana Nhlapo earlier on and Phanyeko says the meeting did not yield expected results.
