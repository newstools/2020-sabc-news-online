South African NGO Gift of the Givers has set up testing facilities in Johannesburg for the purpose of testing for the coronavirus at a reduced rate. A COVID-19 test will cost a discounted, subsidised rate of R750. There is a testing facility in Mayfair and from Monday, there will be one at the Dome in Randburg while a third facility will be opened in Roshnee in Vereeniging later this week. Gift of the Givers says it is  in discussion with various role players to set up other cost effective testing facilities in selected areas nationwide. The organisation is also raising money to help government in the fight against the pandemic. On this video, Gift of the Givers working on intervention plans on coronavirus  Founder Imitiaz Sooliman says:”Our first testing site in Mayfair has been so successful that we need to expand facilities. Fortunately for us the Dome in Johannesburg has come forward and has given us the entire facility, the undercover space and 14 000 s square metre outside parking space.” “We are going to set up a drive through and that’s going to start on Tuesday where people will come in their cars they will no be allowed to get out of their cars. The specimen will be taken from them whilst they sitting in the car.” “We encourage them to phone before they come because it’s not just for anybody. There’s a thing called the case definition it’s a special criteria set up by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) if you don’t fit that criteria we will not test you we ask you preferably to pay by EFT.” Gauteng has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country.
