The trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Monday. Defence advocate Peter Daubermann earlier highlighted a significant number of what he said were inconsistencies in the written testimony of first witness, Andisiwe Dike. Daubermann told the court last week that he wouldn’t be able to cross-examine Dike until he consulted with the police officer who took down her statement.   It’s been four days since Daubermann requested to consult with the police officer who took the written statement of Dike and the court awaits the results. Daubermann said the statement was inadmissible as it contained a number of inaccuracies compared to the evidence given in court. Dike told the court that she spoke Isixhosa to the police captain, who is also an Isixhosa speaker, when a statement written in English was taken. Daubermann applied for a trial within a trial to question the captain, which was immediately dismissed by Judge Irma Schoeman. Omotoso and co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho face a total of 97 charges between them. This video below gives a detailed summary of the witness’ cross-examination:
