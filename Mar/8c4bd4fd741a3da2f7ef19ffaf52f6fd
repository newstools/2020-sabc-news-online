Pastor Timothy Omotoso’s sexual abuse trial is set to resume at the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday. But the judge is only expected to make a ruling on legal technicalities. Last week, a second witness took the stand. Lerato Msibi told the court about the sexual abuse she allegedly endured at the hand of Omotoso. Her testimony mirrored that of the first witness, Andiswa Dike. It was, however, halted due to concerns by the defence team. Defence lawyer Peter Dauberman argued that the two witnesses were led to testify about aspects not contained in the indictment. Msibi is not expected to be in court on Monday and an amended charge sheet is expected to be submitted. Omotoso and his two co-accused are facing 97 charges, including rape, human trafficking and racketeering.  She never gave consent to Pastor Timothy Omotoso to sexually assault her. She said he was powerful and she did not dare to go against him. He also told her that she would die, or become crippled if she does not do what he wants. He allegedly said, if she does not please him, it means she does not please God. She was often called to his room for a so called appointment.
