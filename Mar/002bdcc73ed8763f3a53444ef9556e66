A group of elders and struggle veterans in the City of Tshwane have called for the Gauteng provincial government to put the needs of citizens first, while working to stabilise the city. This follows last week’s announcement by Gauteng Premier David Makhura that the municipality would be placed under administration. The decision followed three months of political battles over the control of the city, with the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) failing in their bids to unseat the Democratic Alliance (DA) with a motion of no confidence. By-elections are expected to take place in May. Among the elders is Former Tshwane Mayor, Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa. “We want a city that works and complies with the Chapter 7 of the Constitution on local government, which is to provide basic services in a sustainable way – that includes the provision of water, electricity, make sure the roads don’t have just a bunch of potholes, welfare, council meetings that are regular, a speaker’s office that promotes public participation. So that is what we are asking for, a normalisation of the City of Tshwane,” says Mkhatshwa. In the podcast below, Father Mkhatshwa discusses the matter with SABC News:  In the video below, ANC’s Lesego Makhubela says by-elections for Tshwane will take place within 90 days:  Makhura and his executive will from Tuesday visit various communities in the City to officially communicate the decision. In a statement, the Premier’s office says they will also consult on service delivery issues that need urgent attention.
