The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) refutes the unfounded and defamatory allegations made by its former Chief Operations Officer, Mr Chris Maroleng in his recent interviews on several media platforms related to his dismissal. A statement released by the SABC says it is necessary to remind Mr Maroleng that he was charged after breaching his fiduciary duties as a director, for acting in a manner which breaches good faith, trust, honesty, loyalty and confidence, and for two charges of gross negligence. “The SABC followed due process from the outset and Mr Maroleng was at all times treated fairly and afforded all the rights available to him in terms of SABC policies and the law. Mr. Maroleng’s baseless allegation that members of the SABC Board are to blame for his dismissal rather than his own actions, clearly demonstrates his unwillingness to assume responsibility for his own serious misconduct,” reads the statement. The SABC board terminated Maroleng’s contract in April 2019, after acting on the findings and recommendations of a disciplinary process, which found Maroleng guilty on three charges related to gross negligence.
