Britain’s parliament has no plans to shut over coronavirus, a spokesperson said on Wednesday, after a minister tested positive for the virus and another lawmaker was advised to stay at home as a precaution. Junior health minister Nadine Dorries said she had tested positive for coronavirus and was self-isolating. An opposition lawmaker who met Dorries was also advised to isolate herself by health authorities. “At present there are no plans to suspend parliament,” a parliamentary spokesperson said in a statement. “We are closely following guidance from Public Health England in response to the situation and have been reassured that the measures we are taking are proportionate and appropriate.” SABC Correspondent Stuart Smith has more on the matter  Lawmakers have expressed concern that the ageing parliamentary estate is ill-equipped to deal with an outbreak of the virus, and that lawmakers pose a higher risk because they travel a lot and meet people.

Britain’s finance minister is due to deliver a budget statement later on Wednesday, one of the biggest days in the parliamentary calendar. Confirmed coronavirus cases around the world
