Stage 1 load shedding has begun. It started at 9 o’clock on Monday morning and will continue until Thursday. Eskom says an increase in the number of unplanned breakdowns at its power stations has necessitated the move. The company says the system is currently constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable. “This is due to a number of breakdowns which we have experienced over the weekend and late last week, and delays in some of the units were planned to come back to service this week. They’ll now return to service in the course of the week,” Eskom Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha. He says says that demand has also incrementally risen since January, putting pressure on their ageing fleet. “We urge the people of South Africa to cooperate with us and help reduce demand in order to reduce the impact of load shedding.”
