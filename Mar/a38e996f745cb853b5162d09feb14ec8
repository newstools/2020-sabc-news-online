The Malemas weer suing Mamabolo for defamation after he allegedly claimed that Malema abuses his wife. In the video below, Boy Mamabolo accuses Julius Malema of abusing his wife, Mantoa Malema.  Mamabolo has been ordered to apologise within 24 hours, and undertake not to make the allegations again. Each party will pay its costs. President Cyril Ramaphosa had also apologised to Malema in Parliament for Mamabolo’s accusations. In the video below, Cyril Ramaphosa apologises to Julius Malema and his wife for accusations of domestic violence levelled against Malema by Boy Mamabolo.  Both Julius and Mantoa Malema were represented by Advocate Thembeka Ngcukaitobi. The court earlier dismissed Mamabolo’s application to be given more time to file an answering affidavit to Julius and Mantoa’s application. It found that Mamabolo’s reasons for not filing answering papers in time were not satisfactory.  Mamabolo said despite having received Malema’s urgent application on 27 February, his lawyers were not available to assist him. The court found that to be hearsay and opted to proceed with the main application of suing Mamabolo. – Additional reporting by Pimani Baloyi
