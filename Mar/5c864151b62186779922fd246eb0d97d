The police and the army have been moving through different sections of the Alexandra Township, north of Johannesburg, urging residents to stay in their homes. The majority of residents in Alexandra have been largely defiant on the first day of the 21-day lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus which has since claimed one life. In this video below, SABC News reporter Maageketla Mohlabe, give updates on Alexandra Township on the 21-day lockdown: During Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo’s walkabout in Setshwetla on Friday afternoon, community members complained of their poor hygiene conditions which include communal toilets and the lack of sanitizers. Makhubo says while he appreciates their poor living conditions, it’s in everyone’s interest that they also stay indoors. “As we leave, we’re going to leave it to the police and the army to now restore law and order here. I mean I can see they got into their houses and they’re back out again. So, we have to keep on reminding them that they must stay in their homes.” “That’s why we asked the SANDF to say look, let’s get in. We’ve been with them. We’ve been with the Metro. There’s provincial police, there’s SAPS. So, everyone is here. They’re going to enforce now.” South Africa earlier confirmed its first two fatalities from the virus – two women in the Western Cape. More than 1000 people in South Africa have tested positive for the coronavirus.
