Eskom says load shedding will decrease to stage two from Saturday morning. The cash strapped power utility earlier dropped load shedding from stage four to stage three. The country has endured almost a week of stage four load shedding after unit one of nuclear power station Koeberg, tripped. Eskom has attributed the drop to stage two load shedding to lower demand over the weekend and improved generation.
