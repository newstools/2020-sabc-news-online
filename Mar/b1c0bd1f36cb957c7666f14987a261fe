Classes have yet to resume at the Tshwane University of Technology despite management’s hope to have academic activities resume at its Pretoria West Campus. The hope was raised after the university’s meeting with student representatives following the chaos that broke out earlier this week. Students are calling for management to speed up issues of student accommodation, National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) payments and to do away with academic exclusion. It is business as usual at the Ga-Rankuwa and Soshanguve campuses. However, students at the Pretoria West Campus have continued with their protest. In the video below Deputy Vice-Chancellor Stanley Mukhola is pleading with students to get back to class:  Meanwhile, the NSFAS has outlined the issues faced by the institution, saying it is working on improving things. Students across the country continue to protest about NSFAS funding. Other grievances include alleged corruption at universities and accommodation issues. NSFAS Administrator Randall Carolissen says there is still a number of students who owe the universities millions of rands. “While NSFAS covers all the debt of the NSFAS eligible students, there is still a large amount of students just above the threshold of NSFAS who owe the universities about R9 billion. The other problem that we have is students that don’t meet the academic progression criteria, who are also protesting. We can’t keep on funding people who don’t progress. So that is quite a problem. There is also a problem with the quantity and quality of accommodation and the fact that students don’t have access to decent accommodation. So, there is a systemic approach that we are working on but the system was terribly broken.”
