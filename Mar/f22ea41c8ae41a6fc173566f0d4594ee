Former tennis star Bob Hewitt has been granted parole and will be released on the 24th of April. He has served three years of his six-year sentence on two counts of rape and one of indecent assault. The Correctional Supervision and Parole Board conducted his parole hearing Tuesday morning in Port Elizabeth. The 79-year-old Hewitt was convicted for raping two young girls he was coaching in the 1980s and 1990s and sentenced to six years in prison in 2016. One of his victims, Olivia Jasriel, attended the hearing.
