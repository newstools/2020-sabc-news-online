Judgement in the murder trial of Thabani Mzolo, who is accused of killing Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student, Zolile Khumalo, resumes on Wednesday in the Durban High Court. On Tuesday, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe summarised evidence of Khumalo’s last moments. Delivering her verdict, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe referred to evidence by Khumalo’s roommate Nosipho Bhengu about how the accused pulled out a firearm from his bag and shot Khumalo. This contradicts Thabani Mzolo’s evidence that the firearm belonged to Khumalo. Radebe says: “As they were seated on the bed, the deceased kept on apologising, and further asking the accused as to what she had done. As they were seated, then two people knocked at the door but they did not respond to that knock. After the knocking there wasn’t a brief period where after the accused said to the deceased that she must stand up. The deceased obeyed and stood up. At that stage Nosipho retreated from them and went towards the window. She then heard the first gunshot. She called for help through the window.” In the video below, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe delivers the judgement  Mzolo is Khumalo’s ex-boyfriend, he is accused of shooting her in her residence room in 2018.
