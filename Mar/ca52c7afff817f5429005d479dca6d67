Tshwane and Ekurhuleni residents whose water was cut off on Saturday due to repairs on a leaking pipeline will have to wait a bit longer before they can start seeing water flowing out of their taps again. Rand Water was forced to cut water supply to several areas around the Tshwane and Ekurhuleni municipalities on Saturday afternoon.    Some of the affected areas in Tshwane includes Centurion, Erasmia, Laudium and Attridgeville. Whereas in Ekurhuleni Germiston and Bedfordview are affected. Water supply was scheduled to resume from 1 o’clock on Sunday afternoon. Rand Water spokesperson, Justice Mohale, says they are busy repairing the pipeline. “I can’t say at what time people will be having water. I am saying the main pipeline was completely empty, but now it is being charged. We are trying to fill it and it is work in progress.”
