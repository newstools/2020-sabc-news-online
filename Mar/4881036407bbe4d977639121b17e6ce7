British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating at 10 Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus, will send a letter to every UK household to urge people to stay at home. Johnson, who has described his symptoms as mild, is leading the government’s response to the crisis, chairing meetings by video conference. The health minister, Matt Hancock, has also tested positive and is working from home. “We know things will get worse before they get better,” Johnson will write in his letter, which will be sent to 30 million households across the United Kingdom starting from next week.
