Legal technicalities at the Omotoso trial at the High Court in Port Elizabeth are again hampering the flow of the trial. Testimony by the second witness Lerato Msibi has been halted as defence lawyer Peter Dauberman argues that the two witnesses were led to testify about aspects not contained in the indictment. He pointed out differences in dates and places. Judge Irma Schoeman told state prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa that he should have brought a formal application for an amendment. Witness Lerato Msibi is not required to be in court. Msibi on Wednesday testified that she never gave consent to Pastor Timothy Omotoso to sexually assault her. In the video below, SABC News Reporter Anda Nqonji wraps up Lerato Msibi’s Wednesday’s testimony:  She said he was powerful and she did not dare to go against him. Msibi said after the sexual encounters with Omotoso, she felt guilty and that she sinned. She continued to stay in the mission because she wanted to be healed and to get a house. It never happened. She eventually did not return to the house and reported the happenings at the Secunda Police Station. She also confessed to her congregation but told them to keep loving Omotoso.
