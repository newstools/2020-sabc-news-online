Eskom has warned that there’s a possibility of loadshedding for Sunday, due to an increase in the number of unplanned breakdowns at its power stations. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says they are replenishing the emergency reserves to be in a better position to meet demand for the coming week. “Although we do not expect to implement loadshedding today, we must indicate that the likely-hood has increased that we may have to implement loadshedding. As we have had an increased in the number of breakdowns and we have identified further system risks, we are continuing to replenish further reserves, and the system is constrained unpredictably and vulnerable at this point. “Should there be further changes, negative changes to the system performance, we may have to implement loadshedding at short notice,” says Mantshantsha. Mantshantsha earlier said Eskom has lost seven power stations due to various technical faults.
