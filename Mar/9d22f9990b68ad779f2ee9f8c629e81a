The South African Red Cross has called on society to exercise the correct measures to protect themselves and others from becoming infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Acting programme manager at the SA Red Cross, George Mamabolo, says people need to do everything they can to help slow the spread of the virus. “I think everybody is scared, to say if I am exposed then what? – that is a general feeling. It is very important for all of us to say as much as we are scared or concerned we all need to take part because coronavirus affects all of us. “We need to take precautions, washing hands – and if you have COVID-19 cover yourself- and isolate yourself to not spread it over. I need to inform the authorities so that the necessary steps can kick in.”
