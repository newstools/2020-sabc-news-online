Apple Inc said late on Friday it will close all its retail stores, except those in Greater China, for the next two weeks to minimize the risk of coronavirus transmission. “We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a letter  posted on the company’s website. “In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China,” he added. “That means team members should work remotely if their job allows.”
Apple reopened all 42 of its branded stores in China on Friday. More than 138,000 people have been infected worldwide and over 5,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.  Apple Inc on Friday called off the in-person portion of its annual developers conference scheduled to be held in San Jose and said it would run the program entirely online in June because of coronavirus fears.
