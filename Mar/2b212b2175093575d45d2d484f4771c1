Globally more than 121 000 people have been infected with COVID-19 in 118 countries and over 4 300 people have died of the virus. In South Africa 13 cases have been confirmed, all of which had traveled to various countries in Europe, including Italy which is the hardest hit and registers the most deaths outside of mainland China where the outbreak began. Many countries have already imposed travel bans or restrictions.
