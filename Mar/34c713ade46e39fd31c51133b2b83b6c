Justice Minister Ronald Lamola will on Monday morning announce his decision on the parole reconsideration for offender Janusz Walus as directed by the High Court in Pretoria. The court set aside former Justice Minister Michael Masutha’s decision to refuse Walus’ parole in September 2018. In that year, the High Court ruled that the parole board failed to include relevant information in its recommendation to the Justice Minister – this includes among others, the failure by the parole board to offer Walus a chance to reply to its suggestion that he remains incarcerated. Several attempts for his release have repeatedly been denied. Walus shot and killed SACP General Secretary Chris Hani outside his Dawn Park home in Boksburg on the East Rand in April 1993. The decision then went back to Minister Lamola to decide the fate of the man who murdered a liberation hero. Walus was sentenced to death for the assassination of Hani in 1993. His death sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.
