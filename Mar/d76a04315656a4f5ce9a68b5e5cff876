The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on the government to implement a ban on all travel into South Africa from countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus has infected 80 824 people in mainland China, the commission said. Globally, more than 138 000 have been infected and over 5 000 have died, according to a Reuters tally. The EFF has also called for all infected patients of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa to be quarantined by the state, preferably on Robben Island. EFF spokesperson Delisile Ngwenya says the government needs to act urgently. “A special facility must be immediately identified and prepared for medical care of all persons infected. It is irresponsible and utterly dangerous to allow un-monitored self-quarantine. This did not work in other countries and will obviously not work here. Coronavirus will sweep all over our country with supersonic speed all because the government lacked the courage to quarantine the infected. Finally, we call for a ban on travel from all coronavirus-infected countries, in particular Europe,” says Ngwenya. South Africa has registered 24 confirmed cases of the virus while it continues to engulf the continent and the globe. Over 120 South Africans have arrived from China after being repatriated in Wuhan, the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. They will then be quarantined at the Ranch Hotel in Polokwane Limpopo for a period of 21 days.
