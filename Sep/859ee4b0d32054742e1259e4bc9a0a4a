Popular video-sharing app TikTok has asked a United States (US) judge to block the Trump administration from banning the Chinese social media network. TikTok and its parent company, Byte Dance Limited, have filed a complaint in Washington challenging US President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order. The US Commerce Department issued a ban on Friday blocking people in America from downloading Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat and TikTok with effect from Sunday. The report has cited the complaint as saying that Trump has exceeded his authority in banning the app.
