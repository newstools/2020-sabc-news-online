Environmental Affairs Minister Barbra Creecy says municipalities’ inability to collect refuse is the root cause of the waste pollution problems in cities. Creecy and KwaZulu-Natal MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube participated in a clean-up campaign on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast on Saturday as part of the International Coastal Clean-up Day. Creecy says government and the private sector need to take a comprehensive approach to fight littering. “The root of this problem is that many municipalities are struggling with waste collection particularly you know that in a big city like Ethekwini where you’ve got a lot of informal settlements as provincial and national government we’re working together to strengthen municipalities to provide weekly refuse removal. But of course community education is also important.” The video below is on International Coastal Clean-up Day:
