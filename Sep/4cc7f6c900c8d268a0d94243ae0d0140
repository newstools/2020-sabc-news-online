The son of the late Human Rights Lawyer, Advocate George Bizos, Alexi has described his father as a man who embraced everybody he had an encounter with – irrespective of their background. He told mourners gathered at the Greek Orthodox Church in Johannesburg that the role his father played will forever be appreciated by the family. “As a family, we celebrate George’s courage as a man with passion and unfolding commitment to justice which was grounded in passion and empathetic humanity. He lived with energy, optimism and selflessness. We will remember him, rest in peace dad, papu, uncle George,” says Alexi Bizos. His Grandson, Nicholas Bizos says George Bizos meant a lot to the family and the rest of the country. “…. a heavy heart that now his home is empty – that he’s not in his bedroom or his garden – you know a warmth now that he’s re-united with his wife and family. Agony that there are no longer long important stories to carry out on. But [I] remain proud that his stories are going to be the ones who are told forever. Everything he did in every way, was done in a way to make things better,” adds the grandson. Bizos was granted an official funeral category one by the President. President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the Eulogy at this funeral, later on Thursday. The procession will then proceed to the Westpark Cemetery where Bizos will be laid to rest alongside fellow freedom fighters, including Ahmed Kathrada.
