The Northern Cape Health Department has assured patients of their safety at the Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Hospital in Kimberley after a man was shot dead and killed at the hospital on Friday. Four men entered the hospital dressed in personal protective equipment and shot the patient in the head in a suspected hit. Police have subsequently launched a manhunt for the four suspects. The department confirmed that the man had been admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit for gunshot wounds. Department spokesperson Lebogang Majaha says, “ We are still reeling from shock from this incident that has sent shockwaves in our communities. Its a first of this kind and we can only hope that our law enforcement agencies will work around the clock to bring the perpetrators to book.” Majaha added, “Currently our psycho-social team is providing trauma counselling to all affected patients and personnel at the Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Hospital.”
