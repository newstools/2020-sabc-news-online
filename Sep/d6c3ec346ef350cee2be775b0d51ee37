Tributes are pouring in for the late political activist and playwright, Reverend Mzwandile Maqina. Maqina was the first general secretary of the African Independent Churches Association. He died on Thursday in Port Elizabeth. He was known for his musical production Give us this Day. His son Thamsanqa Maqina says they have lost a hero. “We are going through a painful time as a family, we are going through a hard time as a home but I believe not only us a home. I do believe we are going through painful times as us all as the entire nation of Africa. Our father our mentor, our hero, our spiritual healer passed on, on the 24th of September.” The provincial chairperson of Azapo, Winky Mngqebisa, says they are saddened by his passing. “He was not selfish enough to ensure every youth and everybody in this country has a role especially when he was able to tap the talent from the youth when it comes to drama and poetry. We remember him before 1976 and during the 1985 feud between Azapo and UDF. He was caught in between because he was a member of PAC but he was saddened by the black on black violence.”
