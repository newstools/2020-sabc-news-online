Former Eskom company secretary and head of legal Suzanne Daniels is on Tuesday expected to testify before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. Daniels exposed fraud and corruption related to the awarding of tenders at the power utility under Ben Ngubane, the former board chairperson. Ngubane concluded his testimony last week. In 2018, Daniels called for the strengthening of whistleblowing legislation after being criticised and later fired from the power utility. Eskom instituted a disciplinary hearing and found her guilty of four charges, including the distribution of confidential Eskom documents to a third party. Daniels was one of the main whistleblowers who lifted the lid on corruption and irregular payments of R1.6-billion by Eskom to Mckinsey and Gupta-linked Trillian Capital. Daniels will give evidence to the commission regarding those contracts, her role and how she was forced out of the power utility. Ngubane denies interaction with Gupta-linked associate During his testimony last week, Ngubane denied any interaction with Gupta-linked business associate Salim Essa while he was still Eskom chair. Inquiry investigators drew several private emails between Ngubane and a businessman, which he refuted were from a businessman. Ngubane also described as disgusting and unfortunate utterances made, by another former Board chair Zola Tsotsi, who called the power utility’s board the ‘Gupta board’.
