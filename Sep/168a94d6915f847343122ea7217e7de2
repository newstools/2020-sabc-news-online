NGO Forensics-for-Justice, headed by forensic investigator Paul O’Sullivan, says they have already received several important leads regarding the murder of top cop Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear. The organisation is offering a R1 million reward for information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Kinnear, a senior investigator in the Anti-Gang Unit, was gunned down near his Bishop Lavis home on the Cape Flats on Friday. He was involved in the investigation of several high-profile cases. Charl Kinnear gunned down in the Cape Flats:  There are questions regarding the withdrawal of the protection service assigned to Kinnear. O’Sullivan says those who want to contribute to the reward can go to their website to donate. “Forensics-For-Justice recognised that the trouble in the Western Cape criminal gangs and mafia syndicates, if left to continue, will bring SA to its knees. We also recognise that Charl Kinnear was a hardworking honest cop that was just doing his job. We have, therefore, taken a decision to issue a R1 million in cash reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons who arranged the murder of Charl Kinnear and we want all South Africans to stand with us to ensure that justice prevails,” says O’Sullivan. Kinnear best at his job Police Minister Bheki Cele on Saturday said Kinnear was the best of the best at his job. The minister said it appeared that the SAPS had failed the slain cop after withdrawing security at his house in 2019, but an investigation is under way to determine why this had happened. “It’s not everyday where you find the media saying ‘this was the best of the best.’ I’ve read the article saying so. Usually, police are lambasted, are forever ugly, are forever doing things that no one appreciates. But, for him (the writer) to say we lost the best of the best, it tells you what kind of a man that we have lost,” says Cele. Bheki Cele visits the home of Charl Kinnear:
