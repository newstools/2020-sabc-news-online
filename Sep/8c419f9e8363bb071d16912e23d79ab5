It’s his prerogative what he wants to do, I would have just done it a bit differently because there is still unfinished reports that need to go in. We never know what the politics behind everything is and maybe the minister will get a committee that is in favour and say more things that are appreciated at government level. I think if you want to have a good committee you need to get a committee that has got very strong views and not afraid to criticise.”
