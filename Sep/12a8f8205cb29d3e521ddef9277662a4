A newborn baby has been killed and two critically injured in a crash involving one vehicle on the M25 in Inanda north of Durban. Life response emergency spokesperson, Leon Fourie, says it’s believed that the driver lost control of the vehicle before it rolled down an embankment. “Upon arrival, paramedics found that a single motor vehicle – a Toyota Hilux bakkie rolled down an embankment several times before coming to rest against a house. The vehicle had three occupants. When the crew got to the vehicle, they found that a one-week old baby sadly passed away prior to the arrival. The mom and dad of the baby sustained serious injuries and were transported to a nearby hospital for further care. At this stage it’s unclear as to what caused the accident and SAPS were on scene.” Attacks on EMS workers Meanwhile, the Western Cape Health Department says there have been 46 attacks on Emergency Medical Service workers in the province since the beginning of this year. Last year, there were 30. In the latest incident which took place early Friday morning in Ocean View, two paramedics were attending to a patient when one of them was held at gunpoint. Spokesperson for Western Cape EMS, Deanne Bessick says paramedics are being attacked while attending to patients. “After loading the patient, the paramedics got into the ambulance. The male got into the driver side of the ambulance, started the vehicle and was then approached by three male suspects. One of the suspects held the paramedic at gunpoint. As soon as the EMS paramedic saw the suspects and the gun, he reacted swiftly and pulled away from the scene. He then proceeded to a safe area and informed his colleague and the patient, who was in the vehicle about what had transpired.” In the video below, EMS personnel safety to be looked into:
