The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume on Thursday with the testimony of North West Premier Job Mokgoro and former Head of Procurement at South African Airways Technical (SAAT), Nontsasa Memela. In February, Memela appeared before the Commission and denied claims of corruption and fraud. She disputed claims that she gave sensitive pricing information regarding a SAAT bidding tender to a local bidding company. Memela told the Commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that she did not accept responsibility for the management of contracts. She instead shifted the blame to her subordinates and other SAAT board members. Nontsasa Memela says she’s being used as scapegoat:  COVID-19 protocol The Commission says that due to strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols, only a limited number of seats will be available for the media in the gallery. “To ensure the safety of all hearing venue users, members of the media public are requested to follow all security procedures as will be communicated by security and commission officials.
