Western Cape Environmental Affairs Minister, Anton Bredell, has given the assurance that the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station has been built to withstand seismic activity. There were fears that the power plant would be damaged after a magnitude 6.2  earthquake struck Cape Town on Saturday night. It happened in the sea about 1 600 kilometres south-east of South Africa. Two hours later a tremor with a magnitude of 2.5 was registered and on Sunday morning another tremor with a 2.3 magnitude was felt nine kilometres north of Cape Town. Some residents of the southern city of Cape Town posted on Twitter that they had felt the tremor. “Guys, we just felt a tremor in Cape Town. Our house shook, the ground shook and rumbled, there was a faint rumbling sound. It all lasted 5 seconds,” one resident wrote on Twitter. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. 6.2 Magnitude earthquake in Cape Town.
