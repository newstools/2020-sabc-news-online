Social media hashtags and accounts are increasingly becoming popular for job seekers and potential employers. The hashtags such as #jobseekersSA, #KeaJobSeeker, and #jobsearch are constantly used to search for potential employers and employees. On Tuesday, Statistics SA said that  2.2 million jobs were lost in South Africa in the second quarter of 2020. It released the unemployment figures for the second quarter, announcing that the unemployment rate decreased to 23.3% from 30.1% in the first quarter. There were 4.2 million people unemployed in the second quarter, compared with 7.1 million unemployed people in the first quarter. Stats SA says the reason for the decline in the unemployment rate, is that fewer people were actively looking for work during alert stages five and four of the lockdown. People who were not looking for work were not classified as unemployed. Some people have been able to find jobs on social media using the trending hashtags and or accounts. Below are three examples of trending hashtags and accounts: #Ojewakeng was started in January 2019 by Keabetswe. It started as a hashtag where social media users can share what problems they had such as financial assistance. However many job seekers have turned to it and some have been successful. Another hashtag #KeaJobSeeker has come from Keabetswe’s trending hashtag.

The account specifies that users can tweet them their qualifications/skills/ and or dream job. What the account will then do is tweet what was sent to them. They do caution however for everyone to do background checks before going for any job interview. We advise that if you get any calls for a job. Make sure you get the company name. Google the company and make sure it’s legit. Tell friends and family of the day, time and venue of the interview and NEVER pay for a job. If it sounds dodgy – stay away. — HIRE ME SOUTH AFRICA (@HireMeZA) February 21, 2018
