An ANC Provincial Executive Committee member and former Mpumalanga MEC and his step-son appeared in court for the alleged rape of two minors. The two victims, aged eight, are believed to be the former MEC’s children. The alleged rape was reported to police in July. His party membership has been suspended. The 48-year-old and 26-year-old step-son appeared briefly in court. According to the Mpumalanga NPA’s Monica Nyuswa, the siblings were raped repeatedly. “It is alleged that the victims, who are eight years of age, were raped several times by the father and stepson. The incident was reported by one of the victim’s teacher in her school hence the matter was reported to the police. The NPA strongly condemn violence against women and children. In this case where children are raped by their biological father, it is a serious case and one that it’s a Schedule 6 offence case. We are going to oppose bail.” The two have denied the charges. “The clients are denying the charges. If the matter is opposed. We are going to bring the application and argue it,” Lawyer Ronaldo Louw says. Mpumalanga ANC Acting Secretary, Lindiwe Ntshalinthsali, says the former MEC has been stripped of his ANC membership. “We took a decision immediately to suspend his membership and we will process it with the PWC and PEC because we take serious issues of allegation of rape and sexual assault. We further request him to step aside as per decision of the NEC with the resolution to say once there’s a case, you should step aside to allow the justice and police system to unfold.” The case was postponed to Thursday for a formal bail application. The two men are remanded in custody.
