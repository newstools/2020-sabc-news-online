Three police officers accused of killing 16-year-old Nathaniel Julies will continue their bail application in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto on Wednesday morning. They are facing charges of murder, discharging a firearm, illegally possessing ammunition and defeating the ends of justice. The teenager, who had Down syndrome, was shot and killed in Eldorado Park south of Johannesburg last month. The implicated officers, Simon Scorpion Ndyalvane, Caylene Whiteboy and Foster Netshiongolo are in custody. On Tuesday, the court heard that, Caylene Whiteboy, was the one who discharged the firearm. She told the court that she was not aware the gun had live ammunition and had thought it was loaded with rubber bullets. Whiteboy accused the other suspects of framing her for the murder. She also says she has received death threats from the first accused. It was also revealed that Simon Scorpion Ndyalvane had allegedly called accused number 3, Foster Netshiongolo, to tamper with the crime scene and make it look like a shoot-out had taken place. The video below, is reporting on the court appearance of the three police officers:  Meanwhile, the teenager’s father Mark Harris said he was not happy that the accused were shifting the blame. “I am not feeling satisfied with what is going on. They want to point fingers at each other, blame each other for what happened to my child. Justice is justice, this is murder. They can’t get away with murder, the shots were fired with live ammunition. My child is dead. I go through a lot of pain, a down syndrome boy cannot defend himself, he can’t even lift his hand,” explained Julies’ father.
