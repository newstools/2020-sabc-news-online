The Department of Public Enterprise has called for patience from all South African Airways (SAA) workers, unions and creditors over funding. The department says it is aware of a planned picket by National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) and South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) outside SAA headquarters on Friday in Kempton Park on Gauteng’s East Rand. They are demanding that funding for SAA be made available. SAA is in danger of liquidation as a creditors’ meeting is also set for Friday morning while government considers several proposals from potential strategic equity partners. In the video below, Numsa says it will take legal action to prevent the liquidation of SAA:  The department’s spokesperson, Sam Mkokeli says government’s priority is to save the airline and the jobs of all SAA employees. “Government is thinking [about] long term … in that you need to limit the government’s exposure to all the troubles and also have an equity partner coming on board. The government is consistent in its decision, its plan is to save the airline and save jobs as much as possible.” “There has been a crunch with regards to the deadline and the processes. The constructive outcome required by government is to see a new SAA streamlined, new technology new equity partners taking to the sky,” adds Mkokeli. SAA’s  fate is discussed in the video below:
