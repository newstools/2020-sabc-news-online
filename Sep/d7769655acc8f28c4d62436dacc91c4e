The committee was formed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the African Union Commission for Social Affairs. The panel has endorsed the protocol for Phase III clinical trials as well as a charter and terms of reference for the establishment of a data and safety monitoring board. Expert panel endorses protocol for COVID-19 herbal clinical trials:  If a traditional medicine product is found to be safe, efficacious and quality-assured, the WHO will recommend for a fast-tracked, large-scale local manufacturing. Dr Ossy Kasilo, the WHO Regional Adviser for the Traditional Medicine programme says some countries such as South Africa are awaiting permission to proceed to phase III trials. “We have identified some of the countries; for example Madagascar, which will test COVID-19 organics which will contain Artemisia and other two indigenous medicinal plants.
