Rulumeni’s legal representative, Bulwana Bangani, says his client is extremely happy with the latest development, but the legal process is still not complete. “What we will be doing is to await the period for the defendant to take the matter further, once that period has  lapsed, then we will go further to get the court to deal with the question of the general damages so the amount payable to the client can be determined by the court.” Meanwhile, DA Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga, says they respect the court’s decision. “We will then take over this issue to the federal executive committee to look into what happens going forward.”
