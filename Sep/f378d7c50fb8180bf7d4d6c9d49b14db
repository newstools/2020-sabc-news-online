Protestors have gathered outside the Temba Magistrate’s Court in Hammanskraal, demanding justice for Thato Radebe who was found dead two weeks ago. The suspect, 30-year-old David Setshoa reported to be the ex-boyfriend of the murdered 16-year-old, is expected to apply for bail at the court. He allegedly threatened to kill Radebe after she started a new relationship. He went on the run after the incident but was arrested by police last week. A protestor has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to help the community fight gender-based violence. “We need answers. We are tired of all these killings. Mr President, listen to us.

We are in dire need of help.” In the video below, protestors gather outside the Temba Magistrate’s court:  Bills to help fight gender-based violence Earlier this month, President Cyil Ramaphosa introduced three Bills intended to fight the scourge of gender-based violence in South Africa.
