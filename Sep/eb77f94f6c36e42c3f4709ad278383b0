Former Western Cape African National Congress (ANC) secretary Songezo Mjongile has died. In a statement, ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe has confirmed Mjongile’s death at his home in Morningside, Johannesburg. Mjongile recently tweeted that he was suffering colon cancer. He was a member of the ANC’s Interim Provincial Committee that was set up when the provincial executive committee was disbanded last year. He was ousted as provincial secretary in 2015 when Faiez Jacobs was elected. Meanwhile, politicians and ordinary citizens have taken to Twitter to express their heartfelt condolences to the Mjongile family.  Farewell Songz. You have made your mark in this world. #RIPSongezoMjongile pic.twitter.com/OV3QNUIzbt — Premier Sihle Zikalala (@sziks) September 18, 2020   This is heart breaking… #RIPSongezoMjongile  pic.twitter.com/o9JWouj1vn — Mbuyiseni Ndlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) September 18, 2020   Another good leader Songezo Mjongile has left us.
