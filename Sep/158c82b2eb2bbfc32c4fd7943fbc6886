Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress (ANC) councillor Andile Lungisa will start serving his two-year prison sentence on Thursday while his legal team is awaiting the date and time for his bail extension hearing at the Grahamstown High Court in Makhanda. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) earlier gave Lungisa 48 hours to hand himself over after his appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Appeal last week. Lungisa was sentenced to two years imprisonment for assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm after hitting DA Councillor Ryno Kayser on the head with a glass jug in 2016, during a council meeting. His attorney Alwyn Griebenow says they have filed papers to the Director of Public Prosecution in Grahamstown to be couriered to the Constitutional Court with intentions to appeal the Supreme Court of Appeal’s ruling. Griebenow says: “In the meantime, Andile still has to report tomorrow around about noon at the clerk of the court, Newlaw Court here in Port Elizabeth.” “We have also filed a notice of motion with the High Court in Grahamstown to bring an urgent bail application to have his bail extended or to have his bail set for him pending the outcome of the Constitutional Court matter.” Earlier in September, the ANC NEC announced a resolution that all members facing criminal charges must step down from their positions. Eastern Cape ANC spokesperson Loyiso Magqashela said Lungisa will be subjected to a disciplinary process.
