Eskom has urged the public to reduce their electricity usage substantially to avoid load shedding as the power grid is severely constrained. This is due to the breakdown of a number of generating units and some units that have been taken off the grid for routine maintenance. Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says: “While no load shedding is expected Eskom would like to request the public to reduce the usage of electricity as the power system is currently constrained.” “Two generation units were forced down over the past 24 hours adding to those currently on breakdowns and on planned maintenance. Breakdowns amount to 10300MW of generation capacity while another 5900 MW is out on planned maintenance.” “Eskom teams are working around the clock to return as many of these units to service as possible.” In the video below, Eskom power supply constraints under spotlight:  The power utility has battled to keep the lights on with power outages being ramped up to stage-4 amid unplanned breakdowns at a number of power stations. On Wednesday last week, Eskom suspended load shedding saying it had returned enough capacity to the grid. In the video below, Eskom anticipates that load shedding will continue until December:
