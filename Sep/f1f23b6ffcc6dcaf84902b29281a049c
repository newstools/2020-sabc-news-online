The State Capture Commission will on Tuesday continue to hear testimony related to a 2010/2011 R1 billion Free State Housing Project from Human Settlements Head of Department Tim Mokhesi. Mokhesi earlier revealed the loss of millions of rands of taxpayers’ money in the scheme that sought to ensure the department would not lose its allocation for the year due to underspending.

Former Head of Department Mpho Mokoena, under whose watch the project was devised, will also testify.
