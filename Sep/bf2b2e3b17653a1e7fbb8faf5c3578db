Brazil recorded 10 273 additional confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, as well as 310 deaths from the disease, the Health Ministry said on Monday. In all, Brazil has registered 4.15 million cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 126 960, according to ministry data. Brazil has the third highest number of coronavirus cases. India, which has now registered 4.2 million cases, overtook Brazil in number of infections on Monday and is just behind the United States. At current rates, India could exceed the US figure of 6.2 million by next month as the disease spreads from the big cities of Delhi and Mumbai to the vast hinterland where two-thirds of India’s 1.3 billion people live, experts say. “It’s becoming a double burden now,” Rajib Dasgupta, a professor of community health at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University told Reuters. “The urban areas are not slowing down, and rural areas are picking up.”
