On Wednesday world leaders will hold a virtual meeting to assess the progress made since the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator was launched in June. Central to the initiative is the vaccine pillar and COVAX project, which focuses on global cooperation to ensure equitable access to future vaccines. United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres says the ACT Accelerator is the global solution the world is looking for. He says its success is dependent on wise and calculated choices by world leaders. $3.5 billion has been contributed to ACT so far out of the $31 billion needed for vaccine development and universal healthcare coverage. Earlier in September President Cyril Ramaphosa has been announced as the co-chair of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator Facilitation Council with Norwayâ€™s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg. The council will advise on the work to achieve the rapid development and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
