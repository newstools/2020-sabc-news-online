A 29-year-old man will appear in the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday in connection with the murder of farming couple Glenn and Vida Rafferty three weeks ago. The Raffertys were each shot multiple times on their farm at Normandien when they returned home after a social event. The man was arrested in the Osizweni township in Newcastle. The police say more arrests can be expected. The suspect’s court appearance will coincide with a visit by  Police Minister Bheki Cele to the area on Monday to give feedback to the farming community about steps being taken to curb crime. On Saturday,  Premier Sihle Zikalala told representatives of farmers and farmworkers that government takes the issue of farm killings very seriously and that it will address allegations of police conduct with law enforcement authorities.
