Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says his legal team will study a High Court ruling which set aside the R135 million sale of the old Tafelberg school property in Sea Point to a private developer. The decision to sell the property to Phyllis Jowell Day School for five years faced strong opposition from civil society organisations and the NGO Ndifuna Ukwazi. They say the property can be used for affordable housing. Winde says the provincial government will respond to the court ruling in due course.
