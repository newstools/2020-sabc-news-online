Tributes have been pouring for human rights lawyer George Bizos, who died at his home on Wednesday. The renowned lawyer represented many struggle heroes including the Rivonia Trialists. The Rivonia Trial led to the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela and nine others, including Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Denis Goldberg, Govan Mbeki, and Ahmed Kathrada.
