The Department of Tourism says it has developed a comprehensive draft Tourism Recovery Plan as part of returning the sector back to business which was adversely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. The department was briefing Parliament on its resource allocation and its plans as the country resumes most economic activities following the lockdown. Deputy Director-General for Tourism Research Aneme Malan says the plan will be implemented in three phases. She says the success of this mammoth task will depend on collaboration with various stakeholders including the private sector. “It will take all of us to implement the recommendations in this plan, all of us, in government at provincial level, as well as private sector. The second one speaks to our tourism supply, and we are saying we need to supply and enhance tourism supply,  support to protect tourism assets with a credit guarantee scheme.” Tourism Recovery Plan The Tourism Business Council of South Africa says government funding of the Tourism Recovery Plan will be crucial if the country is serious about returning the industry back to its pre-COVID-19 glory. Chief Executive Officer Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa says the council welcomes the opening of domestic tourism and that most establishments are complying with the COVID-19 protocols. “It needs to be funded. We need to remain competitive to the international market and here at home. And we need to make sure which countries tourists are choosing to go to…South Africa is on top of their minds and they are able to come to this country. We are appreciative of the fact that the domestic tourism is open. I have travelled myself to Mpumalanga and Limpopo observing protocols and I was quite impressed to see the amount of compliance in some of these establishments. “
