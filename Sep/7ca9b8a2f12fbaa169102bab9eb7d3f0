Police Minister Bheki Cele says slain Cape Town cop, Carl Kinnear, was the best of the best at his job. He was speaking to the media outside Kinnear’s home in Bishop Lavis on the Cape Flats after meeting with grieving family members. Kinnear, a senior investigator in the Anti Gang Unit, was gunned down near his home on Friday. He was involved in the investigation of several high profile cases. Cele says it appears that the SAPS failed him after withdrawing security at his house last year, but an investigation is under way to determine why this had happened. “It’s not everyday where you find the media saying this was the best of the best. I’ve read the article saying so. Usually, police are lambasted, are forever ugly, are forever doing things that no one appreciates. But, for him to say we lost the best of the best, it tells you what kind of a man that we have lost,” says Cele. Cele also visited the family of Sergeant Thabile Mapoma in Harare in Khayelitsha who was gunned down in his car outside his home on Thursday. The family of Mapoma says they are heartbroken following his death. The 43-year old Mapoma was gunned down outside his home in Harare in Khayelitsha on Thursday. The motive for the killing is unknown. Cele says the protection of police officers should be intensified on all fronts. Mapoma’s relative Masixole Gobodo says he was a kind family man. “As the family, we have lost somebody who didn’t have a problem with anyone. Thabile didn’t like anything wrong. We are all crying as this family,” says Gobodo. Cele says ongoing attacks on the police in the Western Cape should not go unchallenged. He says the communities must also condemn the killings.
