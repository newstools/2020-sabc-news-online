The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged world leaders to put targeted measures in place to suppress the spread of the coronavirus. Confirmed cases of the virus across the world are sitting at 30,2 million, with at least 947 000 deaths and 20,6 million recoveries. The head of the WHO, Doctor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says countries need to take the necessary steps now to prevent future pandemics. “We know for certain that there will be future novel viruses and another so called disease X.
