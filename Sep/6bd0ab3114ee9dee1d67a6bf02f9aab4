Free State Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Patricia Kopane has confirmed that she is stepping down as the party’s provincial leader. Kopane, who joined the DA in 2004, says she wants to give new people with fresh ideas and new vision a chance to take the party forward. She has been the provincial leader for the past eight years. Kopane will remain one of the party whips in the National Assembly and as the DA’s Shadow Minister of Public Works. “I believe for the past 16 years I served my party. I have served the people of South Africa and the people of the Free State with distinction and with commitment and I really believe I have done what I was expected to do as a leader. I still believe there are people in the DA who can take this party forward and I will be there to support whoever is elected as a provincial leader or the new leadership in the Free State”, says Kopane.
