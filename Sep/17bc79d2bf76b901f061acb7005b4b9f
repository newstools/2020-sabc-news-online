The Department of Basic Education in the Eastern Cape says the number of learners – to have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) at Ethembeni High School in Burgersdorp – has risen to 102. A multi-departmental task team from Health, Public Works, and Education says they are working with the learners’ families to assist them with not transferring the virus to their homes. Provincial Education Spokesperson, Loyiso Pulumani, says learners who have tested positive for the virus will continue with their exams as they are medically fit. “The number has gone up. The report we got last night (Sunday) from the district director indicated that the number of learners is about 102 now. What we have noted is that between two towns, some of the learners may have gone home while the process of tracing all of the contacts and testing them. What we have decided to do is to make sure that all of the learners and teachers who tested positive will be isolated immediately and continue with the trial examinations.” Loyiso Pulumani elaborates further in the audio below:
