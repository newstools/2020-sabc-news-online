Government must provide more protection to police officers investigating high-profile cases, especially those related to gangs and the underworld, as well as corruption in the police force. That’s according to crime analyst Dr Chris De Kock. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) to probe possible police involvement in the murder of Charl Kinnear in Bishop Lavis, Cape Town. This follows reports that Kinnear, a top police investigator, was on the brink of cracking a “guns-to-gangs” syndicate at the police Central Firearms Registry. De Kock says the high-profile investigation was at an advanced stage and could have led to more arrests soon had Kinnear not been gunned down outside his home. “That investigation it seems was in an advanced state. People were already arrested in 2019. This investigation would have led to more arrests of people in the underworld as well as senior police officers. It’s very dangerous. I would expect there should have been extremely serious protection for an investigator like Mr Kinnear and also others who are investigating these types of crimes, especially in the organised crime arena.” Former rugby player charged with Kinnear murder Former rugby player Zane Kilian has been accused of murdering top cop Kinnear. He appeared in court last week, where he was charged with a count of murder, conspiracy to murder and unlawful interception of communication.
