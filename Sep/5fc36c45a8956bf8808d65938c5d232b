Healthcare bodies say it’s unwise to speculate if there is indeed a link between the killing of Dr Abdulhay Munshi and the culpable homicide case he was facing. Dr Munshi had been accused of negligence in the death of a young patient. He was shot near his Johannesburg home this week – in what many have labelled as an assassination. The medic was a co-accused in a culpable homicide case with paediatric surgeon – Doctor Peter Beale.  A colleague was shot 6 times in what appears to be revenge for a poor patient outcome. Please understand that if you come for us as doctors we won’t come for you when you need us. This is an outrage and every decent person should be up in arms. RIP Dr Abdulhay Munshi. — Jonathan Witt (@Jonathan_Witt) September 16, 2020  The two were taken to court after the death of 10-year-old Zayyaan Sayed at Park Lane Clinic after surgery in 2019. They were due to appear in court again in November. The Islamic Medical Association of South African and the South African Muslim Network (SAMNET) released a joint statement on this matter. ” Its not wise to speculate in the sense that the two are related or not. We hope that the police will spare no effort to bring the perpetrators to book very quickly and publicly We hope that they even go to the extent of offering rewards – looking at cameras around that entire area for this motor vehicle that had no number plate and try to follow it. By all indications it apppears that the HPCSA were about to drop the charges and so were the police. The investigation had cleared Dr Munshi of any negligence or wrongdoing,” says SAMNET’s Dr. Faisel Suleman .  Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize offers condolences to the family, friends and medical fraternity on the passing of Dr Abdulhay Munshi.https://t.co/h6wy4CaK2R — Department of Health: COVID-19 (@COVID_19_ZA) September 18, 2020
