The Gauteng Education Department is arranging a two week camp for matriculants to help them prepare for the 2020 finals exam. Matric learners throughout the country have been attending weekend classes in readiness for the final exams which will start in November. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the two week camp is an additional effort to salvage learning time lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lesufi says, “So far, we are doing weekend classes. We will take those who are struggling to a camp for almost two weeks to ensure they can catch up and those that didn’t have an opportunity to use online learning . We can’t just leave them, we have to give them the necessary support – so indeed we are going to take others for camp for some time because we really need to prepare them.” Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi speaking about schools’ readiness to reopen:
