The African National Congress (ANC) says it will pay back the costs incurred to fly the party’s delegation led by Secretary-General Ace Magashule to meet with ZANU-PF leaders in Zimbabwe. This follows pressure from civil society and political parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Freedom Front Plus. The ANC delegation to Zimbabwe shared a flight with Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, which was en route to the neighbouring country. University of South Africa’s Professor Dirk Kotze, says the decision for the ANC delegation to go to Zimbabwe was taken by the NEC:  President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered Mapisa-Nqakula to compile a report regarding the trip. Ramaphosa is yet to respond to the report. The ANC has admitted that the delegation travelled “in an unusual manner” and therefore it will reimburse government for the costs. The party has however described as successful, the trip undertaken to Zimbabwe for a meeting with ZANU-PF. In a statement, the ANC says it welcomes and concurs with comments by ZANU-PF Secretary of Administration, Obert Mpofu, that the recent engagements will yield positive results and bring change in Zimbabwe. @MyANC welcomes the constructive approach by ZANU PF with regards to engaging with opposition parties and other stakeholders. pic.twitter.com/pKK9sNUYKa — African National Congress (@MYANC) September 15, 2020
