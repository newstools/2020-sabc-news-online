African Transformation Movement (ATM) leader Vuyo Zungula has requested National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise to schedule a motion of no confidence debate in President Cyril Ramaphosa. Zungula is threatening legal action if the Speaker fails to accede to the ATM’s request. Zungula says its motion of no confidence in the President was requested a long time ago. He says the debate is even more necessary now. “In the letter, Zungula first makes reference to previous correspondence from Modise on the 11 of February indicating that she will first consult with the leader of government business and the Chief Whip of the majority party before the motion can be processed. Zungula says the ATM has been patient due to the outbreak of COVID-19.” But he says it will be irrational not to have the debate as COVID-19 precautions have become the new normal. Zungula has now brought a new motion saying the President has failed to provide leadership to the country. This follows evidence of rampant corruption in the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment, the abuse of an SANDF aircraft and the sealing of the CR17 campaign bank statements.
