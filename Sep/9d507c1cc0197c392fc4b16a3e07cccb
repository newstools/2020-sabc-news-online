The National Assembly will hold a debate on the scourge of farm attacks and the murder of farmers and farmworkers on Tuesday. The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Dianne Kohler Barnard will lead the debate on Tuesday. On Saturday, Glenn and Vida Rafferty, were murdered on their farm in Normandien outside Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Gunmen apparently ambushed the couple as they returned home. Security cameras on the property were vandalised. The assailants took the couple’s car which was later found abandoned near the farm. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has condemned the killing. In a statement, Zikalala calls on law enforcement officials to work around the clock to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. The video below is about the farming community of Normandien being in shock by the killing of the Rafferty’s:  Parliamentary committees 54 parliamentary committees will deliberate on various issues of accountability, which involves government department and parastatals.
