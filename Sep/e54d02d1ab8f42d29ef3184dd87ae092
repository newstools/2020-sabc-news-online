Action SA has vowed to appeal the IEC’s decision to reject its application to register as a political party. The IEC’s decision is based on what it says is Action SA’s similar branding with that of another organisation, as well as the use of the South African flag in its logo. Former Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba is the founder of Action SA which was officially launched last month. Mashaba left the DA over a leadership disagreement at the end of 2019. The former Johannesburg mayor then set up The People’s Dialogue, a platform to facilitate discussion between SA citizens and himself as a precursor to the official launch of Action SA. Spokesperson of Action SA Michael Beaumont says they will challenge the IEC’s decision. “We’re going to be launching our appeal in the coming days. The essence of that appeal is that the IEC allowed a political party like the African Independent Congress (AIC) to register despite far greater and striking similarity with the African National Congress.” “In this instance, they are denying our application saying there are similarities with a political party. We don’t believe [that this] rise to the level of confusing voters. And more importantly, this political party that they are saying we are similar to has never contested an election,” explains Beaumont.
