Former Nelson Mandela Bay Councillor, Andile Lungisa, is in the process of approaching the Constitutional Court following the Supreme Court of Appealâ€™s decision to dismiss his appeal to have his two-year prison sentence reduced or converted to correctional supervision. He was out on bail while his appeal was being considered. Lungisa was convicted and sentenced for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm for hitting Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor, Ryno Kayser, over the head with a glass jug during a council meeting in 2016. The video below is on Lungisa approaching the High Court in Grahamstown in Makhanda on Tuesday to seek the extension of his bail conditions:  Last week, the African National Congress in the Eastern Cape also ordered him to resign as a councillor in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro and suspended his party membership. In the video below, Lungisa confirms receiving the letter from the PEC: In the video below, some former ANC Youth League leaders that served with Lungisa submitted papers to the Constitutional Court, seeking a review of the sentence handed down to him. Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Eastern Cape wrote to the Clerk of the Court requesting that former ANC councillor in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro be served with a notice to report to authorities within 48 hours of receiving the notice to commence his sentence.
