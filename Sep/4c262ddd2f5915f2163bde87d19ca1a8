Durban businessman Thoshan Panday hopes the Supreme Court of Appeal might come to a different decision from the High Court in Pietermaritzburg which dismissed his corruption and fraud charges. He intends to seek leave to appeal the High Court judgment next week. The charges were related to a R55 million 2010 FIFA World Cup tender for temporary accommodation for police officers. In 2016, former National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) head Shaun Abrahams overturned an earlier decision by KwaZulu-Natal Director of Public Prosecutions head, Moipone Noko not to prosecute Panday and his co-accused. Noko further refused to prosecute former KZN Police Commissioner, Mmamonnye Ngobeni who was accused of defeating the ends of justice. Mmamonnye-Ngobeni allegedly instructed provincial head of the Hawks, Major-General Johan Booysen, to abandon the investigation against Panday. The video below, former KZN Hawks boss speaks out on planted stories:  Panday and his two co-accused, one of whom was a senior police officer attached to the Policeâ€™s Supply Chain Management unit allegedly channelled millions of rands to his companies. Panday maintains the allegations against him were untrue. He says the decision to prosecute him was being used to settle political scores.
