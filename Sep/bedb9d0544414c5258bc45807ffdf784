Civil society has called on South Africans to stand up against COVID-19 corruption by wearing an orange mask every Friday. Organisations from the faith based sector, business and labour took part in a picket organised by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation at Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg yesterday. This is part of a series of campaigns against COVID-19 corruption. In the video below, Civil society calls on South Africans to stand up against COVID-19 corruption:  Ahmed Kathrada Foundation Director, Neeshan Bolton, says accountability issues must be discussed. “We need to talk about issues of accountability, where exactly does the buck stop and with who? In any given crisis South Africans need to be able to talk about who ultimately should be held accountable.” Joining the picket, Labour Federation COSATU wants the SIU report on COVID-19 to be made public. This after, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that he received the SIU’s first interim report detailing the progress of its investigations in all provinces, national departments and other entities. Cosatu’s campaign coordinator Thabo Mahlangu says: “All those who’ve been found to be corrupt should be prosecuted, punished and sent to jail wearing the orange overall, we are also calling upon all citizens of the country to stand up against corruption and we call for the President to make sure that the report he received he must make it public and as he said he is drawing the line in the sand, we want to see that in action not only in theory.” The picket comes as the country moves to level one and on the eve of Heritage Day.
