The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continued hearing evidence relating to power utility Eskom on Monday afternoon. Earlier, Eskom’s former Chief Executive (CEO) Tshediso Matona testified that his letter of suspension at the power utility came to him as a shock as the board had cleared him of all wrongdoing. Matona served as Eskom’s CEO for seven months from October 2014 to April 2015.
