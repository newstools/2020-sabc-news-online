KwaZulu-Natal police have called on members of the public to take advantage of the firearm amnesty period to hand in illegal weapons. The call comes after a suspect was arrested for the possession of an illegal firearm during an operation at Ekhombe in Nkandla in the north of the province. The amnesty period has been extended to the end of January next year. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker says police officers have seized seven firearms during this operation. “During the operation, police officers seized seven firearms including three automatic rifles. A 39-year-old suspect was arrested for being in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition after he was found with two AK47 rifles, one R5 rifle, two 9mm pistols, one revolver, one 303 rifle and 275 rounds of ammunition. We once again appealing to members of the public to make use of the amnesty period to hand in illegal firearms.” #sapsWC Five suspects arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition by Ocean View police on Thursday night in two separate incidents. #GunsOffTheStreets NPhttps://t.co/VMBkSywwDB pic.twitter.com/6ktXtOXewI — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) September 19, 2020  Gun laws are under the spotlight as some ask for stricter laws:  Parliament in August had approved the new Firearm Amnesty period of six months, which began on 1 August and ends on 21 January 2021.
