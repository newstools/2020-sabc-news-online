Sentencing in the case of former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli and co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi is expected to resume in the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday. The case relates to the 1999 murder of Oupa Ramogibe who allegedly had an affair with Mdluli’s customary wife Tshidi Buthelezi. Mdluli and Mthunzi were found guilty of kidnapping, common assault, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm as well as four counts of intimidation in July last year. However, Mdluli was acquitted on the counts of intimidation in November last year. This follows a Constitutional Court ruling that certain sections of the Intimidation Act were unconstitutional, as outlined in the video below:  Proceedings were postponed after the defence team failed to secure an Epidemiologist to detail the risks of elderly people like the two accused of contracting the coronavirus in prison. Both Mthunzi and Mdluli, who are in their 60’s, have asked the court for leniency when imposing its sentence due to their poor health.
