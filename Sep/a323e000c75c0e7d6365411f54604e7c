Government has vowed to increase its electricity generation capacity in order to grow the economy and attract investment. This as the country recovers from months of limited economic activity due to the coronavirus pandemic. In his weekly letter, President Cyril Ramaphosa says they have now gazetted ministerial determinations that will facilitate the development of more than 11 800 megawatts of additional power generation. After months of load shedding that negatively affected economy, an extra over 11 000 megawatts will soon be added onto the national grid to overcome the country’s power problem.

Ramaphosa also said as part of the regulatory reforms, draft amendments to regulations that would enable municipalities in good standing to procure their own power from independent power producers will soon be gazetted.
