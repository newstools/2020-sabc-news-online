African National Congress (ANC) provincial secretary David Khawe says it’s disappointing that the corruption allegations have come during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “The ANC has to rise and be with the people and in this instance as the ANC we must lower our arrogance. We are saying to the people of South Africa, that this should not have happened during the COVID period. We have a stand as the provincial ANC that we stand against corruption, we’re renewing the ANC, we’re building the integrity of the ANC but brand ANC has to be protected.” Corruption allegations: Gauteng ANC Provincial Secretary Jacob Khawe on integrity committee findings  Meanwhile, ANC in Gauteng has confirmed that it will release the findings of its Provincial Integrity Committee (PIC) report into the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender scandal on Sunday. The PIC investigated the involvement of Health MEC Bandile Masuku, his wife Loyiso who is the MMC for group Corporate and Shared Services and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Spokesperson Khusela Diko in PPE tender corruption. The trio took leave of absence after they were implicated in the awarding of R2 billion PPE tenders by the provincial Health Department. Khawe says they will receive the report during the Provincial Executive Committee’s (PEC) meeting on Sunday. “We’ve established the Integrity Committee for that purpose to help us build the integrity and what we wish is to accept the recommendation of the PIC. As of now, we will get that report tomorrow as the collective of the PEC. I’ve seen his comment on what he is saying he’s responding to the findings of the PIC. So, whether he is cleared or not cleared I don’t know. (The) PEC will receive the report tomorrow. We are starting at nine with the PWC, at one with the PEC and then we can inform the people of Gauteng, likely in the evening or early hours of Monday,” says Khawe.
