The Public Protector’s Office says it will investigate the use of state funds and resources for party interests by the African national Congress (ANC) after its delegation travelled to Zimbabwe last week. This is despite the ANC apologising and agreeing to pay back the costs incurred on the trip – including the delegation’s use of an South African National Defence Forces (SANDF) plane to transport its officials to a meeting with the ruling Zanu-PF in Harare. The Public Protector’s spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says, “The PP will be investigating on the basis of 3 complaints from AfriForum, Freedom Front Plus (FF-Plus) and the African Transformation Movement (ATM) – the last two complainants are from political parties represented in parliament.” “They want her to investigate different aspects of the matter. It does not matter whether any of the players in the matter have decided to make amends, it is important for the PP to establish what happened, who did what and whether what they did was in compliance with the law,” added Segalwe. Mixed reaction to ANC’s Zimbabwe trip reimbursement  Despite being in hot water for hitching a ride on an SANDF plane to Zimbabwe, the ANC says it will continue to engage with ZANU-PF and other stakeholders in Zimbabwe. They flew along with Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, who said she had an official meeting with her counterpart in Harare. The ruling party has since pledged to refund the government for the costs incurred. The ANC delegation was led by Secretary-General Ace Magashule and Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says their trip to Zimbabwe last week was fruitful.
