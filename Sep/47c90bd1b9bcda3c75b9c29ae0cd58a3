 Residents say the R12 million water project in Nthabalala, which was completed in 2014, does not supply them with water as the well does not have sufficient water.  After its completion, it was found that mud was coming out of  the well instead of water. The municipality then constructed another project at Mulima at a cost of R25 million. Two boreholes were drilled and two reservoirs constructed with the intention of connecting them to the mainline water pipe of the failed project at Nthabalala. The attempt to connect the two failed because the water pipes which were laid in 2012 are already damaged.  Meanwhile, the Vhembe district municipality’s spokesperson, Matodzi Ralushai, says they have identified defects in the projects and their technical department will resolve them. “When the district municipality implemented Mulima-Lithande-Lambani the Pfanani Water Supply Project they also experience water source challenge which also contributes to the challenge that we are facing where we are not able to provide water to our communities. We have identified the problems which allows us to go to the community, we have engagements this week, we acknowledge that there’s a challenge in that area.” In the meantime, residents of Pfananani village in the Mulima tribal authority contribute R5 per household to maintain a borehole which was drilled in the village two decades ago.
