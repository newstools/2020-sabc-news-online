The investigation stems from alleged fraudulent activities linked to a water project worth R36 million. It’s alleged that the water tender was duplicated and a company was paid twice. It’s a municipality that has been characterised by allegations of fraud and corruption for years. The Hawks have constantly conducted investigations at the municipality but no one was successfully charged and prosecuted before a court of law.
