Numsa is also holding a picket outside the Zimbabwean Embassy in Pretoria against what it terms Zimbabwe’s authoritarian regime.

Numsa Western Cape Secretary Vuyo Lufele says they stand with the people of Zimbabwe in calling for freedom of speech and association.

He has called on Mnangagwa to free all political prisoners.
