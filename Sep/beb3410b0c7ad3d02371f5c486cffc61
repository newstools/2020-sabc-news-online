The Chief Inspector of Mines at the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy David Msiza says, “We disagree with the statement that says the department has indicated that the container cannot be retrieved. What we have said from the beginning is that the department has been working with the owners of the mine to come up with a plan to retrieve the container.” “We still believe it can be retrieved. The only thing that needs to be done is ensure that it’s done safely. We have been working together with the owners and BRP as we have been frustrated and concerned with the process. The first priority is the retrieval of that container,” adds Msiza.
