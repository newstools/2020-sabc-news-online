Three police officers arrested in connection with the murder of Eldorado Park teenager Nathaniel Julies are expected to appear in the Protea Magistrate’s Court in Soweto on Tuesday morning. They face charges of murder, possession of prohibited ammunition, as well as defeating the ends of justice. Julies, who had down syndrome, died at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital earlier last month after being shot just meters away from his home. It is believed Julies had gone to the shop to buy biscuits when he was caught in a crossfire between police and armed gang members. However, the Eldorado Park community have denied this. They say he was deliberately shot by police as he was unable to answer their questions. They accuse police of trying to cover up the murder. The teenage boy’s death sent shockwaves across the country resulting in a community protests and the local police station being damaged. Cops appear in court for the murder of Nathaniel Julies:   Meanwhile, during last court appearance, the family of Nathaniel Julies, said the three police officers charged in connection with the murder should not get bail.
