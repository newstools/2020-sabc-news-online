The Nelson Mandela Foundation has condemned the Clicks saga saying institutions that seek to further the systemic nature of apartheid have no place in South Africa. The health and lifestyle retailer has come under fire for an online advertisement that denigrated the hair of black people. Clicks closed its doors today in order to offer counselling services to staff amidst protest action by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) that began on Monday.

The answer should be no and if we are to reflect on people like Ahmed Dangor for example who fought so hard against apartheid in this day and age,  in his honour having passed recently, we must then be saying the likes of Clicks have no place in our country. We can’t continue as if this is normal.” Yesterday, EFF leaders welcomed Clicks’ decision to close its doors. It looks like we are getting somewhere, don't give up fighters. All racists must fall, including their apologist. #EFFMustRise #clicksmustfall pic.twitter.com/y4S7vCwgfQ — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) September 8, 2020
