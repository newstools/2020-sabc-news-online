The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says it will engage with President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday to extend presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko’s leave of absence from her government duties. Diko, Gauteng Health MEC, Bandile Masuku and his wife, MMC for Corporate and Shared Services in the City of Johannesburg, Loyiso Masuku were placed on leave in July following a controversial multi-million rand Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender scandal. The video below, is reporting on ANC authority being tested internally:  The ANC PEC has now extended their leave of absence to look into the party’s integrity commission’s report. The ANC Provincial Secretary in Gauteng is Jacob Khawe says, “We are now starting to talk to their bosses for the implementation of that decision. We think it’s in the interest of the bosses that they allow this process to clear them so that when they come back, if they do, the boss doesn’t have to deal with other implications of this decision.” In the video below, Gauteng provincial ANC is reporting on the status of the PPE report:  “So we are engaged with the bosses to show how this decision is in the interest of the bosses. We have already engaged with the Mayor of Joburg and the Premier [David Makhura] has been engaged on our decision. The boss that we have not engaged with is the President, which we are doing this morning,” adds Khawe.
