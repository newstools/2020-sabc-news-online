Phomolong and Mookgopong residents, in Limpopo, say they do not have clean running water since March. They say water delivered by tankers provided by the Modimolle-Mookgopong municipality is not enough. In a statement, Mayor Marlene van Staden says the level of water at the dam that supplies the area is low. The municipality says water levels at Donkerpoort Dam are subsiding. Van Staden says the levels normally reach alarming low levels between August and September every year. Van Staden further says they have devised a schedule where areas that fall under the municipality receive water at intervals. Residents, however, say the shortages began shortly after the announcement of the national lockdown in March. Community leader Mahlomola Maake says there is only one water tanker for several sections. “We are confronted with daily water challenges in extension 5, extension 6, extension 3 and the Phomolong township. The water supply is not consistent, the taps are dry and water only comes out of taps after midnight.” Local residents say they have sent numerous complaints to the municipal offices, all in vain. “We don’t have water and we have been suffering for a long time. When we call and complain, they open for a day. Sometimes those who have taps get running water at night when we are sleeping. We were informed by the mayor that there is no challenge, but we have been living without water since the lockdown started. Some of us don’t have taps; we need help.” Mayor van Staden says there have been several council sittings convened in light of the problem. In the meantime, residents say they are forced to buy water. The municipality has urged those with running water to use water sparingly.
