Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to visit the homes of two Cape Town police officers on Saturday morning who were shot and killed this week. In the latest incident, top cop Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear was shot dead outside his house in Bishop Lavis on the Cape Flats on Friday afternoon. The Hawks are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death. Fifty-two-year Kinnear was a senior detective of the Anti Gang Unit. Kinnear who was shot several times in his car had investigated several high-profile gang-related crime cases, including the murder of prominent Cape Town lawyer Pete Mihalik, and the extortion case of controversial businessman, Nafiz Modack. Last year, 24-hour security was placed outside his home after he received death threats. On Thursday, a 43-year-old off duty police sergeant Thabile Mapoma was shot dead in his driveway in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats. The motive for the killing is unknown.
