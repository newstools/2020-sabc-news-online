Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has warned those who do not adhere to the COVID-19 regulations that they are undoing the good work accomplished in curbing any further surge of the virus. Manzini says some people are behaving as if the virus has vanished and they are violating the COVID-19 regulations. She says since the announcement to move to Alert Level one of the national lockdown – many people have been abusing alcohol, been seen in public without wearing masks, and disregarding social distancing. “Now that we have moved to level one, social, religious and other gathering are permitted but our people should make sure that they familiarise themselves in terms of the number of people that are expected in different venues for an example the maximum limit is 250 applies to indoor gatherings and a maximum limit of 500 applies to outdoor gathering and each and every venue must not exceed 50% of its normal capacity. Now we have seen that our people think that because we are on level one then it means that life is back to normal.” South Africa has been on lockdown since March 26 to curb the spread of the COVID-19. Under Alert Level one, most normal activity will resume with safety precautions still adhered to. People will still be expected to observe social distancing, wear their masks and sanitise as advised by the Department of Health.
