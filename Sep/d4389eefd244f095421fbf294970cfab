Gauteng Premier David Makhura has suspended the province’s Head of the Department of Health, Professor Mkhululi Lukhele, with immediate effect. In a statement, the Premier says he is acting on the recommendations of the Special Investigating Unit in a report presented to him on September 22. The SIU found that the Head of Department had failed to exercise his responsibility in the awarding of PPE contracts. Makhura says the actions, or omissions by the HoD, may have resulted in the department incurring fruitless and wasteful expenditure. Professor Lukhele will remain on precautionary suspension.
