Troubled airliner Mango, a subsidiary of the cash-strapped South African Airways (SAA), says it’s still hopeful of finding a solution with SAA’s Technical division that will allow it to continue operating. SAA had threatened to ground Mango’s entire fleet over the past weekend due to non-payment. However, Mango says it will continue to operate via third party aircraft lease arrangements, including its own aircraft. SAA Technical withdraws its services to Mango Airlines:  Mango Spokesperson Benediction Zubane has appealed for patience and understanding. “As part of contingency, Mango will continue operating via third party aircraft lease arrangements, including operating own aircraft to fly our passengers until further notice. We ask for patience and understanding as we navigate through this difficult time. We will keep everyone updated as soon more information becomes available. We profusely regret and apologise for the inconvenience caused.” Mango on Saturday said it remained committed to flying all passengers to their respective destinations as planned and especially over this weekend following threats to ground the flights. Zubane said talks to continue operations are under way. “Mango can confirm that ongoing key and sensitive discussions are taking place between Mango and SAAT currently to continue with operations under these difficult times. Mango is currently operating as normal and all customers should always check Mango’s website for any changes to their flight status. We remain committed to flying all passengers to their respective destinations as planned and especially over this weekend.” Talks between SAA Technical Team and Mango following threats to ground flights:
