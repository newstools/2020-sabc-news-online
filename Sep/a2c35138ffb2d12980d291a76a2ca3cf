Parents really need to be vigilant also dress your child in brightly coloured clothes when in a public and down at the beaches so they easily spotted in a crowd. The communities need to be vigilant If there is someone that doesn’t seem to need to be there or out of place please report it immediately. if your child goes missing it needs to be reported immediately there is no 24 hour waiting period. ” In Durban, a teenage girl was nearly snatched in Avoca on Tuesday night. The 15-year-old was walking from a shop to her house, when two suspects in a car tried to pull her inside. The alleged kidnapping attempt was reportedly disturbed by a resident.
