The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has extended leave of absence for Health MEC Bandile Masuku, his wife Loyiso who is an MMC, and Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko by two weeks. The ANC PEC  in the province has resolved that investigations must continue into a controversial multi-million Personal Protective Equipment tender involving the three officials. The PEC has rejected a report into the matter by the Provincial Integrity Committee saying there was inconsistency and inadequate information. The PEC also felt the report was contradictory in terms of oversight by the MEC. It has further resolved to engage with the government and the SIU to speed up their investigations. The report will now be sent to the Provincial Working Committee to be reassessed. The report was supposed to be released today however the PEC has extended the leave of absence for the Masukus as well as Diko. #ANCGP The PEC will not return to the Report to the PIC but it will go to the PWC and officials for processing. There is a resolution to engage government and the SIU to speed up their investigations.#sabcnews pic.twitter.com/ADfzQjb1MQ — #TheLordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) September 21, 2020  In late July, the ANC in Gauteng requested its Provincial Executive Committee members, Bandile Masuku and Khusela Diko to step aside pending investigation into allegations of corruption in the awarding of personal protective equipment (PPE) tenders. Masuku, who is the Health MEC in the province,  is accused of influencing the awarding of a controversial R125 million PPE tender. The ANC said at the time that the decision to place Masuku and his wife MMC Loyiso on a leave absence does not mean the party has found them guilty.
