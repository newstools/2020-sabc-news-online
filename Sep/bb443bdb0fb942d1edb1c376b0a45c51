The Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (CONTRALESA) says it is disappointed that initiation schools are not allowed to operate during Alert Level 1 of the lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the easing of lockdown regulations earlier this week opening up fully some sectors of the economy including the tourism and hospitality industry. CONTRALESA President Kgosi Lamek Mokoena says they expected initiation schools to reopen since they’ve missed the winter season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mokoena says government has promised to engage CONTRALESA on the matter. “If we allow some activities, some gatherings 500 people and so on outside, why can’t we have the same thing with traditional initiation schools. We can do that because we can respect social distancing, having masks and all those other things. But government must expedite this because we want to avoid people having illegal initiation schools.” Highlights of different Lockdown Levels below:
