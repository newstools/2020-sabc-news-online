Political analyst Dale McKinley has described former president Jacob Zuma’s remarks about chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo as a desperate attempt to hide the truth. The commission is yet to respond to Zuma’s letter in which he says he will not participate in its proceedings until Zondo recuses himself. Zuma has sent the letter through his lawyer Eric Mabuza saying he feels Zondo is biased against him and wants to portray him as uncooperative. Last week, Zondo ordered Zuma to testify from November 16 to 20 and said he would not negotiate with witnesses on the date they wanted to testify. State Capture Commission issues new date for Jacob Zuma to appear before the commission:  McKinley says Zuma is using delaying tactics to avoid taking accountability. “Most of the public would come to the conclusion that there’s something he obviously wants to hide. He wants to be able to hide his side of the story. But why would you not want to testify if you are given an opportunity to give your side of the story and that’s the question that everybody is asking,” adds McKinley. Below is Zuma’s letter to the commission: DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7219440-Letter-to-Judicial-Commission-of-Inquiry-28-09.js", {
