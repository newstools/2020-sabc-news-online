The US Presidential Debate was a showcase of personal attacks and chaotic exchanges in a 90 minute head to head in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday night. That in summary is one way of looking at the first of three debates between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden. In the 90 minutes allocated, moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News battled to maintain decorum or control because he was mostly ignored by a President running amok. As one observer noted, this was not a debate, it was a disaster. While the focus shifted from the Supreme Court, to healthcare legislation and climate change among others, it was the personal attacks and the President’s inability to allow his opponent the opportunity to speak that shaped the entire event. Biden tried to hit Trump on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed over 205-000 Americans but was talked over constantly; finally saying “will you shut up man”, followed by “keep yapping” to the President of the United States. Biden, exasperated, later said Trump was the worst President American has ever had.

On race relations, Trump said there was tremendous division under the previous administration while Biden said Trump was the real racist.
