The trial of double murder accused Rameez Patel is continuing at the Polokwane High Court in Limpopo. Patel is being tried for the 2015 murder of his wife Fatima. She was found bludgeoned to death at their home in Nirvana. Patel has also been charged for the 2017 murder of his mother. During a bail hearing in 2018, Prosecutor Mashudu Mudau said Patel’s mother’s murder was a result of a family feud. Mudau said evidence showed that the accused had differences with his mother and they had not been speaking for two months before her death. He was also allegedly placed at the scene of the crime and is accused of paying a hit man. The accused had pointed a finger at his brother Razeem, but the state said there was no proof of this.
