Former Eskom board member Venete Klein has expressed discomfort with the fact her name was one of those that the Gupta brothers had recommended to serve on the power utility’s board in 2014. Klein is giving evidence before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. She and other former board members – including former board chair Ben Ngubane have been implicated in forcing another former board chair Zola Tsotsi out of Eskom.
