Former Eskom board chairperson, Ben Ngubane, has described as disgusting and unfortunate utterances made, calling the power utility’s board the ‘Gupta board’.

Earlier this week, former Eskom board chair,  Tsotsi concluded his evidence and implicated Ngubane and Klein for wrong doing at the power Utility.
