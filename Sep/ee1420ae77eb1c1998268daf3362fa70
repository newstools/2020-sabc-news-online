Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby says South Africa has the tenacity and will to defeat the scourge of corruption just like it defeated colonialism and the apartheid era. He was speaking during a virtual prayer service to mark the Anglican Church of Southern Africa’s 150th anniversary on Sunday. Government has come under great scrutiny and has been marred by allegations of corruption, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. The African National Congress’ (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee meeting is discussing the findings of the provincial Integrity Commission’s report into a controversial Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender in which Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku, his wife Loyiso and presidential Spokesperon Khusela Diko have been implicated. The party is expected to pronounce on its decision later on Sunday. Welby says all leaders must adhere to the call of God to bring hope to the hopeless and nurture the nation they serve. “The misuse of resources that God has put so abundantly on this continent; the misuse of resources to fight COVID-19 … we are here to say that the call of God is to nurture the poor; to bring hope to the homeless; to raise up the oppressed; to give light to those who dwell in darkness to educate those who suffer from exclusion to heal those who are ill to give employment and purpose to those who are shut out of economic life,” says Welby.
