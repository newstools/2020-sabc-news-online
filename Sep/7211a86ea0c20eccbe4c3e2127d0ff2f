Executive Director of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), Jeniffer Ntlatseng has promised to re-open some of the difficult cases IPID has been unable to deal with in an effort to help the victims get closure. Speaking during her visit to IPID’s office in Bloemfontein, Ntlatseng says the organisation intends to provide strategic direction to the provincial leadership based on the Directorate’s Vision 2025. She says the strategy is to help mitigate various challenges IPID officials based at the coalface of government are facing. Ntlatseng says communities will also be able to call IPID on a soon-to-be-launched telephone number to report matters concerning them. “We also are going to launch a hotline number so that people can interact with us directly and improve transparency in the organisation itself. We’ll also be re-opening the cases that we calle cold cases. The ones that have been closed because there’s a decline in prosecution or there are other challenges to those cases and it’s important that we do that. We are also going to be dealing with young people getting involved in our programmes, which is also key getting young people to join us in our programmes.”
