Noma Gigaba, the wife of former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, is applying to the High Court in Pretoria to have charges against her dropped. She is facing charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. Gigaba appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday and the matter was postponed to the 23rd of next month. Advocate Dali Mpofu, who is representing Gigaba, argued that the aim of arresting his client was to bully and intimidate her. Mpofu further said the fact that the Hawks arrested Gigaba is abuse of power, therefore charges against her must be dropped. Advocate Dawie Joubert is representing the former minister who is opposing the application. In the video below, Noma Gigaba appears in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday:
