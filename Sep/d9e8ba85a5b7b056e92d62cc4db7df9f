Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress (ANC) councillor Andile Lungisaâ€™s lawyer will on Wednesday lodge papers in the Constitutional Court appealing his two-year imprisonment sentence for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. His appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein was dismissed last week. He was convicted of hitting Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Ryno Kayser with a glass jug over the head during a council meeting in 2016.
