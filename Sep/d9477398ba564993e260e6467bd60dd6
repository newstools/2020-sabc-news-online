Officials in the Eastern Cape say most of the learners who tested positive for COVID-19, at the Ethembeni Secondary School in Burgersdorp, are asymptomatic. The number of learners that have tested positive has risen to over 100. Over 650 learners from the same school have been placed in quarantine. “It seems as if we going to keep on getting some new number because I mean this thing has this tendency of being there and yet a person may not be showing symptoms. So they going to keep on testing them just to make sure that they try and contain it. If it wasn’t for the mother that came to school to report her child tested positive they would not have known it. Out of the 140 number of positive cases in the eastern cape this school has 102.” A multi-departmental task team from Health, Public Works, and Education says they are working with the learners’ families to assist them with not transferring the virus to their homes.
