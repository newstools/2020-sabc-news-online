The Cape Town Weather Office says a cold front will be moving across the Cape on Friday, bringing heavy rainfall. Forecaster Kate Turner says they have issued a watch for localised flooding expected over the Cape Metropole and south-western parts of the Cape Winelands. She says the cold weather will continue over the weekend. “This front will move over the province during the course of the late afternoon and into tomorrow. So, cloudy conditions will remain over the next coming days, cool temperatures as well and even some isolated showers lingering into tomorrow, Sunday and into Monday as well,” says Turner.
