The Hawks have raided the offices of the Inxuba Yethemba Municipality in Cradock in the Eastern Cape. The purpose of the operation is to secure documents that are linked to the allegations of fraud and corruption valued at approximately R26 million. The investigation stems from the alleged flouting of procurement processes. Several companies were awarded tenders for the construction of roads and maintenance of projects. All service providers were paid in full during the 2017/2018 financial year but work was partially done. Those who are involved are yet to be charged as investigations continue.  It’s tense there by Cradock Municipality building. Hawks have arrived to clean up the corruption. I want to know how many people are arrested.
