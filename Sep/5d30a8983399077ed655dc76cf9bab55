The Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal transport departments are meeting to discuss the creation of a smart corridor between the two provinces. The aim of the corridor is to create jobs and resuscitate the economies of the two provinces which have been negatively affected by the global coronavirus pandemic. Spokesperson for the Gauteng Roads and Transport Department, Theo Nkonki, says work is already being done to improve the economies of the two provinces. “If we manage the movement of goods and people much better between the port of KZN and Gauteng where most of the goods that you see on the N3 are mostly destined, if we make it more efficient, you know more modern, we can make a huge dent in the economy and create new economies. So, we are having very interesting discussions between the two MECs in trying to reconfigure and reimagine the corridor because it is an economic artery for the province and for the country,” says Nkonki.
