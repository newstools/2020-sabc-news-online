This lockdown really changed things but I’m happy that things are getting back to normal,” says one tourist. “It’s a beautiful view, I love nature.

The Free State government says it’s working round the clock to revive the tourism sector:  Provincial Economic Development Spokesperson, Kgotso Tau, says the value chain of tourism is now open to those who love nature. “The tourism contributes R3.1 billion to the GDP of the province and you would remember that we actually attract 1.1 million international visitors to the Free State.

Tourists are also happy that they will celebrate Heritage Month with their families by touring the country without COVID-19 strict regulations.
