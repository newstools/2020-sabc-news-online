The Eastern Cape Provincial Anti-Corruption Council has failed to hold a single meeting over the last financial year or during the current financial year. This was revealed by Premier Oscar Mabuyane, in response to a parliamentary question from the Democratic Alliance (DA). The council comprises of various heads of government departments and law enforcement agencies. It is mandated to co-ordinate government’s anti-corruption work. The DA says the failure of the council to meet shows a lack of political will to deal with corruption. The party’s MPL, Bobby Stevenson says, “The failure of the provincial anti-corruption to hold a single meeting, highlights the lack of political will to deal decisively with the on-going looting in the Eastern Cape. We need to put this province on a new trajectory so the people can have hope that their lives can improve. This will never happen while state resources are being abused and a connected elite is being enriched at the expense of the people.”
