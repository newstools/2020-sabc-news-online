The Northern Cape Co-operative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs Department says it is co-operating with law enforcement agencies following a raid at its offices. The Hawks raided the offices as part of an investigation into alleged tender irregularities by an acting director in the department. It is alleged that the department’s acting director approved a quotation for her daughter’s company to supply items for the department without disclosing their relationship. The department’s Spokesperson is Xhanti Teki, “The department fully cooperated with the Hawks and availed all the necessary documentation that was needed. The MEC wishes to state it clearly that law enforcement agencies must fast-track it’s ongoing investigation so that both tigers and flies involved in wrongdoing are arrested and brought to book. There’s neither space nor time for piggish looting. Ours is to support the law enforcement agencies to speedily bring the matter to finality.”
