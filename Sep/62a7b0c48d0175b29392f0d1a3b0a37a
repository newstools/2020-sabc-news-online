The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) in Gauteng has expressed disappointment that fraud and corruption related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has overshadowed the work done by health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The union says it notes the suspension of Gauteng Health Head of Department Mkhululi Lukhele. His suspension comes weeks after Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku was placed on precautionary suspension over alleged PPE fraud. Denosa says it condemns corruption and wants those implicated to be brought to book. “We are quite disappointed by the fact that our members who are frontline workers have done so well in terms of defending our country in particular the citizens of Gauteng against COVID-19. Now we are worried that all that wonderful work which was done under the leadership of Prof Lukhele and MEC Masuku is now overshadowed by this PPE saga. Our position on corruption is we despise it and those found in the wrong, the law must take its course,” says the Gauteng Denosa Chairperson, Simphiwe Gada. Suspended Gauteng officials to appear before SIU The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) says Masuku, his wife Loyiso Masuku who is a Member of the Mayoral Committee for Group Corporate and Shared Services as well as Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko will appear before it on October 6. The SIU says the trio must account for their alleged involvement in the controversial PPE tender. The unit has ordered the Chief Financial Officer and Head of the Gauteng Health Department to pay back R30 million to the provincial government for tender irregularities. Spokesperson of the SIU Special Tribunal, Advocate Selby Makgotho, says the three will have to prove their purported innocence. In the video below, Makgotho explains further:
