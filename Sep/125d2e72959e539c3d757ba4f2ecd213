The N3 Toll Concession’s Commercial Manager, Con Roux, says they anticipate traffic volumes reaching around 2500 vehicles passing through the toll per hour. “The last day of a long weekend we’re expecting extremely heavy traffic. The reason for that, is because of the heavy traffic coming down to KwaZulu-Natal on both Wednesday and Thursday, that we’re expecting to be concentrated into a single rush of traffic, and in particular, tomorrow (Sunday) afternoon started at around midday. We’re expecting traffic volumes approaching two-and-a-half thousand vehicles an hour through Mooi River.”
