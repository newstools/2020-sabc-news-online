Madhi says they are currently looking into why South Africa’s death rate is far lower than was initially predicted. This comes as the number of daily new infections has also dipped sharply. Six months after South Africa reported its first case of the coronavirus – the country has recorded more than 600 000 positive cases and just over 15 000 deaths. According to the Medical Research Council, the actual death toll, could be more than double. However, despite crowded townships, low hygiene levels and the country’s struggling healthcare system – the current death rate is still far lower than was initially predicted. This is in comparison to other countries with similar infection rates, like Columbia, Peru, Mexico and Spain which have all experienced far greater loss of life. Research is currently being untaken to determine what went right in South Africa. Madhi says a high level of disease and infection among South Africans may have played a role in many people being immune to COVID-19.
