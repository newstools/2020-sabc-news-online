The Lenasia South District Hospital, south of Johannesburg has undergone a major refurbishment. The R48 million  facility was upgraded from a clinic to a 103-bed hospital over the past few months to care for COVID-19 patients. However, officials at the hospital say because there isn’t a high number of such patients needing to be hospitalised, some of the beds will be used for general medical care. The provincial government says despite the declining number of COVID-19 infections and a high recovery rate, it continues to add the to number of beds, increase staff capacity, as well as improve technological capabilities.  https://t.co/ONxdVSfPOu — GautengGov (@GautengProvince) September 18, 2020  Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC, Tasneem Motara, says these investments will go beyond the COVID-19 period. “Some of the major work included the installation of medical gas connections on all 103 beds. The final cost of all these upgrades, as well as new installations, as well as the work we did in terms of convertions from a clinic to a hospital beds came in at at investment amount of R48 million from the provincial government. And therefore this R48 million investment will be able to service the community for the COVID-19 period as well as for the post COVID-19 period.”
