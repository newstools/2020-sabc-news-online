A second wave of coronavirus infections is a point of concern for the Eastern Cape government. The infection rate in some regions is rising, with a focus on the Joe Gqabi district. Last week, there was a mass outbreak at a school in Burgersdorp where 102 people were infected. Since then, the number of infections in this region has risen to 192. Eastern Cape Health MEC, Sindiswa Gomba, says resources will be redirected to the affected areas to curb the spread. “It shall put a lot of strain on government whether its Eastern Cape or whoever if our own people can be careless at this pointing time because it only takes one match stick to light the fire secondly our structures as I say they are not dismantled for instance as I was coming here the whole IMT meeting was on which is chaired by Dr Zungu with all the districts so that our structures are still strong,” says Gomba. On Monday, the Department of Health confirmed the total number of cases as 671 669. The country also recorded 188 new COVID-19 related fatalities, bringing the total number of deaths to 16 586. In a statement, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize stated that most of the new deaths were recorded in the Free State. “Regrettably, we report 188 more COVID-19 related deaths: “3 from the Eastern Cape, 1 from KwaZulu-Natal, 2 from Gauteng, 4 from the Western Cape and 178 from the Free State,” says Dr Mkhize. The cumulative number of tests conducted to date is 4 152 480. The number of recoveries now stands at 604 478, this translates to a recovery rate of 90%. #COVID19 Statistics in SA as at 28 September.
