The Acting Gauteng Health MEC, Jacob Mamabolo, says health officials are concerned over people not being extra cautious when in public gatherings amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This after the province recorded a 6% increase in COVID-19 cases in a space of one week. Gauteng has the most COVID-19 cases in the country – recording close to 220 000 infections since the start of the outbreak. There are 19 000 active cases in the province. Mamabolo says despite the country operating under Level One lockdown, people need to still exercise safety measures to protect themselves against the virus. “Funerals have proven to be an area of concern. Public transport – the biggest area is the taxi industry – we are looking at that cluster. We are also concerned over areas of high concentration, like malls and workplaces. The implications of moving to alert level one for us as a province, with a small landmass but a huge population and a key site of economic activity, it means we are more exposed.” Below are Alert Level 1 lockdown restrictions:  South Africa has recorded 903 new COVID-19 infections for a second day in a row. The total number of COVID-19 cases now stands at 672 572.
