If they are positive, we can make sure that the person who has received such results, their cellphone can send a notice to those who are nearby without identifying who the person is. It helps to alert us because when we go into a resurgence of the virus you need to be warned early if you have been exposed because by then you will find that the infections will come from where you didn’t expect.” Addressing the nation last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the Department of Health developed a WhatsApp and SMS system for people without smartphones to provide them with test results and alert them of possible exposure to the virus. “Contact tracing is a preventative measure to protect yourself and your family and friends.” He added that the government will be undertaking a nationwide survey to assess the levels of infection within SA.
