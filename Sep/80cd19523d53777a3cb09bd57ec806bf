Blackhead Consulting Director, Edwin Sodi, told the State Capture Commission that he did not see anything wrong with investing in a residential property with Free State Head of Human Settlements Tim Mokhesi. Sodi supported Mokhesi’s testimony that the R650 000 he paid into the residence that Mokhesi has been staying in was purely a commercial transaction from which he would derive financial benefit. Blackhead Consulting was part of the joint venture that was awarded R255 million to audit and assess asbestos in low-cost houses by Mokhesi’s department in 2014. “When I had this conversation with Mr Mokhesi  I had this at the back of my mind that we were not going to go into phase 2 of the project. We had completed phase 1 and that was it. We had been paid some of the money that was due to us but there were certainly more payments that were outstanding.” “But I did not see anything wrong entering into this transaction. But of course later on when questions were being asked I look back and say maybe it was not such a smart decision for us to do that,” adds Sodi.
