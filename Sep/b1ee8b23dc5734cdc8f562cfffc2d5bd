Police Minister Bheki Cele says it appears that police have failed Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear (52) who was gunned down near his Bishop Lavis home on the Cape Flats on Friday. Visiting Kinnear’s family earlier, Cele said investigations are continuing into why security measures were withdrawn from Kinnear’s house. Kinnear, a senior investigator in the Anti Gang Unit, was involved in the investigation of several high-profile cases. Last year, 24-hour security was placed outside his home after he received death threats. The security was withdrawn in December. The motive for Kinnear’s killing is unknown at this stage. The Hawks are currently investigating the circumstances around his murder. National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole has ordered the activation of a 72-hour action plan following Kinnear’s murder. Later on Saturday, Cele will visit the home of another policeman who was killed in Khayelitsha on Thursday.
