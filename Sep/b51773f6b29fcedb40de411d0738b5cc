The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has confirmed that it will release the findings of its Provincial Integrity Committee (PIC) report into the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender scandal on Sunday. The PIC investigated the involvement of Health MEC Bandile Masuku, his wife Loyiso who is the MMC for group Corporate and Shared Services and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Spokesperson Khusela Diko in PPE tender corruption. The trio took leave of absence after they were implicated in the awarding of R2 billion PPE tenders by the provincial Health Department. ANC Provincial Secretary in Gauteng, Jacob Khawe told the SABC that they will receive the report during the Provincial Executive Committee’s (PEC) meeting on Sunday. “We’ve established the Integrity Committee for that purpose to help us build the integrity and what we wish is to accept the recommendation of the PIC. As of now, we will get that report tomorrow as the collective of the PEC. I’ve seen his comment on what he is saying he’s responding to the findings of the PIC. So, whether he is cleared or not cleared I don’t know. (The) PEC will receive the report tomorrow. We are starting at nine with the PWC, at one with the PEC and then we can inform the people of Gauteng, likely in the evening or early hours of Monday,” says Khawe. ANC in Gauteng receives report on PPE corruption scandal  Earlier, the provincial Integrity Commission’s report found that Masuku had failed to adequately oversee the PPE contracts that his department had awarded. Masuku has already written a letter to the commission objecting to its findings. Political Analyst Xolani Dube says if Bandile Masuku is removed from the PEC or his position as an MEC, that will make Gauteng Premier David Makhura a zombie premier.
