South African National Defence Force member Hendry Ngomane, accused of shooting and wounding a civilian in Limpopo, has been granted R5000 bail. Ngomane appeared in the Morebeng Magistrate’s Court on a charge of attempted murder. He allegedly shot and wounded Solomon Modise on the thigh during an argument over the wearing of a face mask last Thursday. Solomon Modise was part of a group of people who allegedly got into a confrontation with members of the South African National Defence Force at Mogwadi in the Molemole Municipality. It is alleged that civilians were being accused of not wearing face masks. The SANDF says Modise was accidentally shot when the civilians tried to disarm the soldiers during a scuffle. Spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi says SANDF member Ngomane was granted R5000 bail. “The South African National Defence force member Hendry Ngomane (29) was granted bail of R5000 in Morebeng Magistrate’s Court today and charged with attempted murder. The police at Mogwadi in the Capricorn District have arrested a member of the SANDF for allegedly shooting a 27-year-old man Solomon Modise at the local shopping complex. Members of the National Defence Force were reportedly on duty monitoring COVID-19 compliance in the area when they approached a group of people who were not wearing face masks.” The case has been postponed to October 28th. Meanwhile, Malabi-Dzhangi says Modise was treated and released from hospital. His family plans to take legal action.
