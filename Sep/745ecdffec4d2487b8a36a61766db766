The family of ANC politician, Andile Lungisa is happy that the Grahamstown High Court has granted him bail. Lungisa was granted bail of R10 000 on Friday morning. He applied for bail while awaiting a decision for his application in the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal his two year prison sentence for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. This is after he smashed DA councillor Rynor Kayser on the head with a glass jug during a 2016 council meeting. His brother, Ayongezwa Lungisa, says they believed that there could only be one outcome to this application. “We are happy that the judge alluded to the facts we have been talking to and that it would not be the lower courts that would make a conclusion and that the Constitutional Court would arrive at a different determination in relation to the issues we raised,” adds Andile’s brother.
