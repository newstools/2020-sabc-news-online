Workers’ union NEHAWU has accused Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha of paying lip service to fraud and corruption. This follows the transfer of his spokesperson Kenny Mathivhas to the Social Development Department after he was found guilty of submitting fraudulent travel claims during a disciplinary hearing last year. NEHAWU spokesperson Norman Mavhunga says the Premier should step down as he’s failing to deal with corruption in his office and the provincial government. “The removal of Mathivha FK to Social Development is nothing but a foil to hide a fraudster and the person who has brought the name of the office of the Premier and the provincial government into disrepute. The Premier doesn’t walk the talk but laments at fraud and corruption.” “We do concur with the statement of Cosatu that the Premier should really step down to afford the provincial government an opportunity to be led by a leader who’ll be firm and take decisions in regard to corruption and fraud,” adds Mavhunga.
