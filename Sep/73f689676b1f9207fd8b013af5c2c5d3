City Power in Gauteng is stepping up its clampdown on businesses and posh estates in an effort to recover millions of rands owed. City Power says it will soon be moving on suburban townhouses in Midrand and Roodepoort in Gauteng after it cut-off the electricity supply to over 200 residents in upmarket Dainfern, near Fourways in the north of Johannesburg. It’s targeting residents who owe them as well as those illegally connected to the network. City Power disconnects illegal connections: City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena says: “City Power has been doing cut off operations across the city of Johannesburg as part of our revenue collection efforts. We had a very successful operation in Dainfern.” “We did manage to cut off most of those. These are some of the reasons why we could not provide stable electricity during winter time because of overloading that is brought by this illegal connection and also people who have actually bridged our meters.”
