Political analyst Xolani Dube has warned that removing Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku from the African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Executive Committee would weaken Premier David Makhura politically. The PEC is meeting this weekend to decide the fate of Masuku, his wife Loyiso Masuku and Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko. It will consider the provincial Integrity Commission’s report which found that Masuku had failed to adequately oversee the Personal Protective Equipment contracts that his department had awarded. This relates to a 125-million-rand tender that was awarded to Royal Bhaca, the company of Chief Madzikane Thandisizwe, the husband of the Presidential spokesperson. Masuku has already written a letter to the commission objecting to its findings. Dube says the current developments are an indication of power struggles in the ANC in Gauteng. He says, “The reality here is about the fate of David Makhura more than that of Bandile Masuku. Because you have to understand that this issue of Masuku also talks about the power struggle within the ANC in Gauteng. And so if Masuku is removed from the PEC as well as from the position of being the MEC, that would make Makhura to be a zombie premier and a zombie chairperson of Gauteng.” Click below to watch the full interview: In the video below, SABC reporter Samkele Maseko speaks to Gauteng provincial secretary Jacob Khawe on the latest developments:
