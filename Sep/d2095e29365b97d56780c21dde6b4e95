City Power in Gauteng will continue with its clampdown on businesses and upmarket estates on Sunday as it moves to recover millions of rands in unpaid electricity bills. City Power says it will soon be moving on suburban townhouses in Midrand and Roodepoort. The power utility already cut off the electricity supply to over 200 residents in upmarket Dainfern, near Fourways in the north of Johannesburg, last week. City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena says: “The money that is owed to us it is money that we really need to reinvest into the infrastructure, also maintaining the very same infrastructure that customers are using. City Power disconnects illegal connections:  “So we will continue doing this operations especially in these posh suburbs because that is where most of the money is and that is where most of the consumption is.” “Areas like Dainfern, Midrand complexes and even businesses in Roodepoort we have customers that are owing us and the message to them is that we are coming after that money.”
