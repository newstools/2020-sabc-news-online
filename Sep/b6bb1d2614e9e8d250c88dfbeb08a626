The case of the man accused of the murder of a couple in Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal has been postponed to October 29, to allow for further investigations into the matter. Siyabonga Macu appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court on Monday and he abandoned his bail application. He is charged with the murder of farming couple Glenn and Vida Rafferty in August. It is believed that he was part of the group that ambushed and gunned down the couple.   A peaceful protest took place outside Newcastle Magistrate’s Court ahead of Macu’s appearance. There has been tension in the area over recent farm attacks.
