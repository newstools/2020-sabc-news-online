Five suspects arrested for tender fraud at the South African Police Service (SAPS) are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday following the arrest of two police employees and three civilians. Those arrested include a colonel, and administrative employee within the SAPS Supply Chain Management Division and three civilians. The five face charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and perjury. The arrests are in connection with R56 million tender fraud at SAPS . A total number of people arrested in connection with the multi-million rand SAPS vehicle branding and marking tender now stands at 41. Investigating Directorate Spokesperson Sindisiwe Twala explains, “Amongst the three civilians, two of the suspects were initially arrested in June and appeared before the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court where they were released on R5 thousand bail each along with the first batch of accused arrested in the same month. The pair has been rearrested after due diligence was done by the work of the Investigating Directorate who uncovered that the pair lied under oath about not having previous convictions. They have been rearrested and each face an additional charge of perjury, fraud and failure to disclose previous convictions.”
