The President of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) Mandisa Maya, together with four other Judges of the SCA and Judge President of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, Selby Mbenenge have demanded that African National Congress (ANC) politician Andile Lungisa retract remarks he made last week when he handed himself to authorities to start his two-year sentence for assault. He handed himself to authorities after the SCA dismissed his appeal earlier this month. Lungisa said his matter was not fairly decided due to political interference and corruption at the SCA.

Lungisa’s bail hearing, is expected take place in the Grahamstown Magistrates’ Court in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape on Monday. Andile Lungisa awaits bail hearing in prison:
