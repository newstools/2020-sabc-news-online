Western Cape Police Commissioner Yolisa Matakata has described the death of top cop, Charl Kinnear, as a great loss. Matakata was speaking at Kinnear’s memorial service held in Belhar. The Cape Town Anti-Gang Unit detective was gunned down outside his house in Bishop Lavis earlier this month. A former rugby player, Zane Kilian, has been arrested for the murder and is currently in police custody. In the video below, former rugby player charged with Kinnear’s murder:  Matakata says Kinnear’s murder won’t go unpunished. “As we all know, an investigation is under way into the murder, investigators are hard at work in order to get those who killed him, an attack on the police official is an attack on the state, hence, we will not rest until the perpetrators are behind bars, there has to be justice for Kinnear.” Kinnear will be buried on Saturday.  Meanwhile, Kinnear’s brother has described him as a dedicated police officer and a loving family man. Kinnear was speaking at a memorial service at the police air wing in Belhar. Kinnear says his brother loved his job in the police. “Charl told me Grant whatever you do,  do it right the first time so that you do not need to go back to fix it, because time is precious, what I’m asking you, it’s actually a family plea as well,  whatever we do let’s do it right the first time, our people out there depends on you to ensure justice is served.”
