The acting mayor of the Nelson Mandela BayÂ  Municipality, Tshonono Buyeye, says he will now turn to the Constitutional Court after the Grahamstown High Court dismissed his application to prevent the Eastern Cape MEC for Co-operative Governance & Traditional Affairs the (CoGTA) Xolile Nqatha from placing the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality under administration. Buyeye filed an urgent application to the High Court after Nqatha served the municipality with notice of intention to place it under administration. Nqatha cited instability in the metro as the basis for the intention to place the municipality under administration. The municipality has been operating without a mayor since December 2019 and there was a delay in approving the budget. Mayoral spokesperson, Siyanda Vazi, says they will take the matter to the Constitutional Court. The Department of Cooperative Governance in the Eastern Cape has welcomed the High Court ruling.
