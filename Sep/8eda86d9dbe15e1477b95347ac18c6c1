Experts say while the second surge of coronavirus infections is expected in South Africa, it might not be as bad as what other countries are experiencing. Wits University’s Francesca Conradie says South Africans seem to have a better than expected herd immunity and this might help weather the impact of a possible resurgence. Yesterday, the country recorded 1 906 new coronavirus infections bringing the cumulative number to 665 188. The COVID-19 death toll rose to 16 206 after a further 88 fatalities were recorded since the last report. “Quite a high number of South Africans have been exposed to the coronavirus and have antibodies evidence of an infection. So, they’ve already had it and if we look at data that’s coming out, say Khayelitsha, 40% of people are showing immunity towards the coronavirus. So, we have slightly higher immunity than we thought we were going to and in addition to that if you kind of make an estimate of how many South Africans have been infected it looks like 15 million.” Lesufi concerned about the second wave Meanwhile, Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi has expressed concern that people are letting their guard down which could lead to a resurgence in infections. Lesufi was in Diepkloof in Soweto where a spot check was done to determine if people were adhering to protection measures such as wearing masks and social distancing. “All the MECs and the mayors are all over the province because we want to pre-empt and act if we get a second wave and that’s our fear as a province, to say there is a likelihood of a second wave because people are losing their guards, they can go to church, travel, go to events and party. If we don’t monitor, we will have a sudden surge of new cases.” Below are the latest coronavirus stats:   Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 118 731 88 892 15 270 27 021 UNALLOCATED 0 27 September 2020 3110 386 520 DEATHS 838 4163 4203 2626 355 CONFIRMED CASES | 670 766 DEATHS |  16 398 TESTS CONDUCTED |4 143 466 RECOVERIES |  603 721 CLOSED CASES | 620 119 46 128 197 86163 110 430 219 039 29 012 16 243 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Addressing the nation a week ago, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged South Africans to continue taking preventative measures as advised by the Department of Health. He warned South Africans of the second wave of infections.  As he announced South Africa’s move to Level 1 one, more regulations were eased to allow South Africans to further start adjusting to the ‘new normal.’
