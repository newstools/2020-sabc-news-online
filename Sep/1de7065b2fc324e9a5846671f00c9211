President Donald Trump will announce a further drawdown of US troops from Iraq on Wednesday, a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. That announcement will be followed by another one in the coming days on a further reduction in US forces in Afghanistan, the official said. The decision comes as Trump, a Republican, faces blowback from a report that he allegedly made disparaging remarks about US war dead. Trump is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in polls ahead of the November 3 election. His announcement, and the timing of it, may be aimed at convincing voters that he is following through on promises to end what he has described as Americaâ€™s endless wars. The United States has around 5 200 troops that were deployed in Iraq to fight the Islamic State militant group. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last month that the United States was expected to reduce the number of its troops in Iraq by about a third in the coming months.
