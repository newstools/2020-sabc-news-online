The Protea Magistrate’s Court, south of Johannesburg, on Wednesday postponed judgement on the bail application of three police officers accused of murdering the Eldorado Park teenager, to next Monday. The teenager, who had Down syndrome, was shot and killed in Eldorado Park south of Johannesburg last month. The implicated officers, Simon Scorpion Ndyalvane, Caylene Whiteboy and Foster Netshiongolo are in custody. NPA Spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane says the state has prepared their own case.

It is not up to the defence to dictate to the state as to who they must call, when and how. The bail application process, the onus is on the accused persons to convince the court on a balance of probabilities that there are exceptional circumstances that permits their release on bail. Investigations are ongoing; they are not yet concluded.” Nathaniel Julies murder Accused wait for bail ruling  The court previously heard that, Caylene Whiteboy, was the one who discharged the firearm.
