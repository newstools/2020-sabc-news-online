Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has made public the report relating to the ANC delegation trip to Zimbabwe. This follows a request by President Cyril Ramaphosa that the report be made public. Mapisa-Nqakula gave a high-level ANC delegation a lift to  Zimbabwe on 8 September aboard a military aircraft. Ramaphosa issued the Minister with an official reprimand on Sunday. President Ramaphosa issues Mapisa-Nqakula with an official reprimand:  The President said that Mapisa-Nqakula did not act in the interest of good governance and failed to act within the law regarding the trip. He said the Minister’s salary will be docked for three months starting from November 1. The money will be donated to the Solidarity Fund. The Presidency also said that Ramaphosa told Mapisa-Nqakula to ensure that the ANC reimburses the state for the trip. “The President has also directed the Minister to make sure that the ANC reimburses the state for the costs of the flight to Harare and to report to him once that has been done.” Adding that: “The President took this action after his consideration of the Minister’s initial report and a supplementary report that the President had directed the Minister to provide on the circumstances that led to the ANC delegation travelling on a South African Air Force plane. While the Minister was on an official trip for which the President had given permission and for which she was entitled to use a SAAF aircraft, the President found that it was an error of judgment to use the plane to convey a political party delegation.” Mapisa-Nqakula’s report:
