The search for Lundi Mzimkhulu, who escaped from custody, continues. He was part of a group of six inmates who broke out of the Sada Correctional Facility in the Eastern Cape last month. The group allegedly overpowered correctional officials before forcing them into an office and stripping them of their uniforms. They then drove out of the facility with a state vehicle. Hawks Spokesperson Lwando Zenzile says this is the second time in less than a year that Mzimkhulu has escaped from custody. He was in custody for his alleged involvement in a 2018 cash-in-transit heist. “The Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigations in East London is seeking assistance that could lead to the arrest of 33-year-old Lundi Mzimkhulu who escaped from lawful custody at Sada Prison on the 14th of August 2020. It is alleged that Mzimkhulu escaped with several inmates. At this point in time, it’s only Mzimkhulu who is outstanding. All other inmates have been arrested,” says Zenzile.  -Report by Siseko Kondile
