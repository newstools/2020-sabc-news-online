Free State Head of Department Tim Mokhesi says the official who masterminded the scheme which saw the department lose millions of rand in 2010 was not held accountable. The scheme, aimed at ensuring that money from the National Treasury was used for low cost housing before the financial year was up, resulted in ineligible contractors being selected and being paid without any work having been done. Mokhesi says he decided who was to be disciplined after a preliminary investigation but admits that the man responsible for the pre-paid scheme slipped away untouched. “To your knowledge, Mr Tsometsi devised the plan and he was not even charged. Can you explain that Mr Tsometsi was not in the department, he was a witness in the disciplinary hearing. So yes he was not charged but surely it should have been a matter of course that if he moves to another department he is charged.” “He was not charged Mr Pretorious. Well I don’t have a reason except to say it was per recommendations,” says Mokhesi. Below is the live stream:  The commission continues to hear testimony related to a 2010/2011 R1 billion Free State Housing Project from Human Settlements Head of Department Tim Mokhesi. Mokhesi earlier revealed the loss of millions of rand of taxpayers’ money in the scheme that sought to ensure the department would not lose its allocation for the year due to under spending.
