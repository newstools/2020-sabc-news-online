Former Free State Human Settlements MEC, Mosebenzi Zwane has blamed the irregular use of funds in the province’s 2010 housing project on former HOD Mpho Mokoena. The province was keen to spend R1.4-billion allocated to it by the National Treasury for low cost housing before the end of the financial year, to avoid its re-prioritisation to other provinces. The plan saw the selection of many ineligible contractors without an open tender process and the payment for their services upfront. Earlier this week, Mokoena told the State Capture Commission that he was threatened with losing his job by Zwane, if he did not sign off on documents related to the project despite knowing that there were irregularities.
