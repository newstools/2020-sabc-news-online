DPE and Treasury are a DISGRACE! They have failed SOES! We demand that they put funding into SAA as they promised. We demand that they #ShowUsTheMoney They promised to fund the BRP process, WHERE IS THE MONEY?

SOEs are in crisis cos govt as shareholder has failed! Why should Pravin and Tito continue to be paid from OUR taxes, when workers at SAA and Express have not been paid for months? #SAA#PaySAExpressWorkers — NUMSA (@Numsa_Media) September 18, 2020
