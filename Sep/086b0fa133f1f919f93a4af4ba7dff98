The South African Liquor Traders’ Association says it fully supports government’s plan to close down liquor outlets and restaurants that are not complying with lockdown regulations. Regulations on the sale of alcohol, the curfew and gatherings have been relaxed in alert level one of the coronavirus lockdown. The sale of alcohol will take place Monday to Friday from 09:00 – 17: 00, but will still not be sold on weekends and public holidays. Consumption of alcohol on-site in bars, taverns and restaurants will be permitted up to midnight. However, the night club industry remains banned. The overnight curfew will now be from midnight until 4 am. It is still mandatory to wear a mask when in public and adhere to social distancing. Convenor of the Association Lucky Mtimane says he spoke to Police Minister Bheki Cele. He says they are both equally concerned about those who were breaching the lockdown regulations. “We had a long chat on the phone and he actually shared information about the places that he visited and we agreed that these rules are being flouted. We call on government and the minister to let the law take its course. We do not support any trading of liquor in an irresponsible way,” says Mtimane. Police Minister warns liquor outlet owners Police Minister Bheki Cele says government will intensify law enforcement operations during Level 1 lockdown. Cele says more than 300 000 people have been arrested and charged for violating lockdown regulations countrywide since the lockdown started in March. He also issued a stern warning to restaurant and liquor outlet owners and managers who flout the lockdown curfews, saying they will lose their operating licenses.
