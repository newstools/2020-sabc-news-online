Eskom technicians started off by dismantling a mini-substation which they say was also built illegally. The power utility believes the equipment that they’re removing is part of its infrastructure which was stolen somewhere, compromising power supply.  #EskomGauteng #MediaStatement ESKOM GAUTENG LAUNCHES ENERGY MANAGEMENT CAMPAIGN pic.twitter.com/8dLTcvYkUC — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) September 29, 2020  Some of the affected residents are standing by, watching helplessly as their electricity is cut off.

Among the areas targeted is Dainfern, where one property owner is in arrears of R1.4 million in unpaid electricity charges.
