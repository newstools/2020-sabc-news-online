His brother, Leon Titus says, “Danny went into a coma a month and a half ago, he went for a cataract operation and as they pushed him out of the recovery room, his heart stopped beating. He’s got two daughters Mariska and Eline. He was 63 but all these things he was diabetic related things that landed him there.”
