The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has used Heritage Day to reiterate its call for the expropriation of land without compensation. In a statement the party says, “There is no heritage to celebrate as long as black people remain landless and excluded from the mainstream economy.” The party has urged people to reflect on their history and the current painful realities they face beyond the wearing of traditional outfits. The EFF says, “A concrete move towards a heritage founded on justice necessitates the return of land to the country’s majority. It has also called for all colonial and apartheid statues to come down as well as the removal of “Die Stem” from the national anthem.” The party says as things stand, black people remain servants and tenants of a white minority and a genuine celebration of heritage can only be achieved when the injustices of the past are corrected.
