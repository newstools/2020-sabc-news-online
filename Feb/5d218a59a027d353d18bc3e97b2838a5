The Health Safety and Security Unit at the eThekwini Municipality says it is concerned about the increasing number of new born babies found dumped in various parts of Durban. The unit says since the beginning of 2020, about 11 babies have been found dumped. On Saturday a new born baby was found dumped in a bin near a flat in Bonella. It is believed the baby was suffocated to death. The unit’s chairperson Des Moodley says pregnant mothers who do not want their babies can drop them off at various municipal centres in the city. “Unfortunately it’s becoming quite common in the last couple of weeks. We do have a drop off Centre. If you font want the child no questions asked just drop the child off a drop off Centre which the city has created. Probably about 11 in the last , since January this year. That the reason why the special projects unit has started looking at abortion clinics, people that are culprits behind disposing of these fetuses.”
