The funeral service for the late African National Congress (ANC) stalwart Derrick McBride is currently under way in the Durban City Hall. McBride is the father of former head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), Robert McBride. The stalwart died earlier this week. He is receiving a Special Provincial Funeral for his role in the struggle.  Some of the provincial ANC leaders are in attendance. The late McBride and his son played roles in the bombings by the ANC’s special operations unit in Durban and surrounding areas between 1981 and 1986. KwaZulu-Natal premier – Sihle Zikakala – has called on political leaders to work for the benefit of ordinary people rather than serving their own interests. Zikalala says leaders should use their positions to better the lives of ordinary people.  Watch a related video below:
