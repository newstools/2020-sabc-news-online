Firefighting resources and staff are being stretched to capacity due to three fires raging in the Boland. The Huguenot tunnel has been re-opened to traffic, while the Du Toits Kloof pass remains closed. This, as the Cape Winelands District Municipality’s Fire Services, has been battling a fire raging in the Du Toit’s Kloof Pass since Tuesday. About 6 000 hectares of mixed fynbos have been destroyed. There’s also a fire raging in the Wemmershoek mountains. Firefighters are battling the veld fires amid strong winds and temperatures of 40 degrees. Municipal spokesperson, Jo-Anne Otto says they’re also tending to a fire in Monte Carlo Ceres. “The fire in an area of mixed fynbos around 5 kilometers outside Ceres was reported late yesterday afternoon. Due to strong winds and very rough terrain the fire is proving difficult to contain. The fire services are focusing on preventing the fire from spreading onto the mountains, where there is a lot of combustible vegetation. They are assisted by 11 ground team members, 1 helicopter, 1 purpose-built Land Cruiser and a water pumper.”
