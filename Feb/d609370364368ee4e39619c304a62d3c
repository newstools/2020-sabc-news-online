Economic growth and job creation will top the agenda at this year’s Gauteng State of the Province Address (SOPA). Premier David Makhura will be delivering a pro-poor SOPA at the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Garankuwa on Tuesday. He is expected to address some burning issues, including service delivery. Gauteng has in recent months seen a spate of service delivery protests. The Premier will also reiterate the province’s stance on E-tolls. Crime and education will also feature in the speech. DA’s ‘Real SOPA’ But the Democratic Alliance (DA) says very little has been done by Gauteng Premier to improve the lives of residents. DA Caucus Leader, Solly Msimanga, has delivered what the opposition party calls the ‘real State of the Gauteng Province address’ ahead of Premier Makhura’s State of the Province Address (SOPA) on Tuesday. Msimanga says every year during the address, Premier Makhura delivers promises but never focuses on the pressing issues that are affecting residents on a daily basis. The DA leader says he has witnessed decay in almost every aspect of the Gauteng people’s lives. Msimanga says more people live in filth and squalor. He has sighted sewage flowing on the streets and refuse piling up. He says there are municipalities failing to render services because they are cash-strapped. Msimanga says some of these municipalities are owed millions of rands by the provincial government departments.  He says subsequent to this, the municipalities are failing to pay off debts owed to Eskom and Rand Water, which puts further pressure on utilities. Msimanga says the SOPA must ensure that the province offers practical and implementable solutions. In the video below, John Steenhuisen says SA can only work if the DA works:
