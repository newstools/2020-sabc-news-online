The increase brings the total number of deaths in the province to 549 by the end of February 5, with the total number of cases at 19 665. Hubei in central China has  been in virtual lock down for nearly two weeks, with its train stations and airports shut and its roads sealed off. The coronavirus was first identified in Hubei’s provincial capital of Wuhan and is believed to have originated at a seafood market in the city. The number of deaths on Wednesday was higher than the 65 reported on the previous day, though the number of new cases fell slightly from 3 156. The province’s healthcare infrastructure has come under heavy pressure as a result of the epidemic.
