Eskom has announced that Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 9 am on Thursday until 6 am on Saturday. The power utility says this is due to the loss of three additional units overnight. According to Eskom there’s a high possibility that load shedding will continue over the weekend as there’s a need to replenish reserves for the coming week. Eskom Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says, “This is due to three additional power generation units having been lost through the night at three different power stations. We are working hard to restore them to service but they have added to our shortage of capacity so we urging the people to help us reduce demand.”  This comes after Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe announced on Wednesday that the country’s power utility Eskom faces two years of load shedding. This in contrast to Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter saying that load shedding can be expected for the next 18 months as it catches up on maintenance.
