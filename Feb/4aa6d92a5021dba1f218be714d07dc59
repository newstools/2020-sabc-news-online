Former President FW de Klerk says the decision to unban apartheid 30 years ago was consciously driven and not made under pressure. Sunday marks the 30th Anniversary of De Klerk’s announcement of the release of former President Nelson Mandela from prison and the unbanning of all political parties. De Klerk says despite ongoing speculation about his motive for the decision, it was done for the good of the country. “Our decision, it wasn’t because of the pressure. Yes, the pressure was there. It kept us on our toes. It was bad for South Africa that we were becoming more and more isolated but it was conscious driven. We wanted to dismantle the injustices of apartheid. There are still people today describing me as a traitor who come from that old right wing. They still persist in calling me a traitor every time I make a public appearance and on social media some of them come forward to say that,” says De Klerk. African National Congress (ANC) Veteran Pallo Jordan says former President FW De Klerk had no choice but to unban political formations and release political prisoners in 1990. Jordan who was in exile in Zimbabwe at the time says the international pressure on the apartheid government was increasing. “The Banks were refusing to loan South Africa any more money. Internationally the regime was absolutely isolated. The only international statesperson they could rely on, not even support but less critical remarks about them was Marget Thatcher. I mean every other significant figure in the world was denouncing the South African regime. He had no friends,” explains Jordan.
