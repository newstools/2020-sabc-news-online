Top US and Kenyan trade officials will work to establish a framework for a US-Kenyan trade and investment agreement, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told US business leaders on Thursday after a meeting with US President Donald Trump. Kenyatta told a forum at the US Chamber of Commerce that Kenya was keen to attract more US investment and become a hub for US companies doing business in Africa and beyond. “It was a very clear tone of urgency for these two offices to move with speed to bring this to a conclusion,” he told several hundred executives at the event.
