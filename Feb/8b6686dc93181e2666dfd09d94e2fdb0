Eskom has announced that it is downgrading load shedding on Sunday morning to Stage 2. On Saturday the embattled power utility implemented Stage-3 power outages, due to unplanned outages and low emergency reserves, that were expected to continue until Monday. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the downgrade in power outages is due to some units being returned to the power grid.
