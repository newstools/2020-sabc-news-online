The North West University‘s (NWU) Mafikeng Campus has reopened for registration and allocation of residences following a week-long shutdown. The campus was one of six campuses including the Universities of the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal which were closed this week following a call by the South African Union of Students (SAUS) to shut down public universities. Students demanded, among others the eradication of historical debt, free registration for the poor and the revision of guidelines for accreditation of student accommodation. SAUS reached an agreement with the Department of Higher Education to among others, allow students with outstanding debt to register and establish funding for post-graduates. Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Dan Kgwadi, has committed to engage further with student representatives to address these challenges. “The staff started to arrive this morning at 11:00 and the parents came with their students. We will, however, do everything possible to facilitate everything in the interest of our students. We are continuing with registrations on Sunday and the allocation of rooms on Sunday,” says Kgwadi.
