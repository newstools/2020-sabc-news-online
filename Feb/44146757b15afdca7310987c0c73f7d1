Former head of procurement at South African Airways (SAA) Technical, Nontsasa Memela, is expected to continue her testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Tuesday. On Monday, she defended her reason for communicating with JM Aviation when the bidding process was still on-going. The former head also denied that she provided JM Aviation, a local BEE company, with bid documents and assisted them in getting a R1.2 billion contract with SAA Technical. Memela told the commission she was not aware that there was a prohibition clause that excluded her from communicating with bidding companies while the bidding process was open. “My understanding is that there was nothing wrong cause I don’t sit in the evaluation committee. The only people that are not allowed to talk to the bidders because they have all the information are the people in the CFST, the bid evaluation committee chair,” says Memela.
