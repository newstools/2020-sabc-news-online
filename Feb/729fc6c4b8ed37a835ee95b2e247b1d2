Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko will meet with the communities of Alexandra and Tembisa in Johannesburg on Saturday to engage on various safety issues affecting them. This forms part of a series of community safety summits this weekend as part Safety Awareness Month. The summits are aimed at mobilising communities to participate in fighting crime where they live. Spokesperson for the Community Safety Department in Gauteng, Pinkie Numa, says the mec will also lead a march. “MEC Mazibuko will use the safety summits to engage various communities in the province on safety issues affecting them. MEC Mazibuko will also lead a march as part of a programme to reclaim the dignity and rights of women.” Last month, Minister of Police Bheki Cele, committed to working with the community of Alexandra after a 28-year-old was fatally shot allegedly in a crossfire between police and car hijacking suspects in the township.
