Shoprite Checkers has urged all customers that have purchased certain brands of 400 grams of canned pilchards, to check their tins for two specific batch codes.  This comes as West Point Processors recalled two batches of the product over safety concerns.  Customers that find batch codes ‘ ZST2 and ZSC2 ‘ on the top of their tins can return the product at any Shoprite or Checkers stores for a full refund.  The affected brands are Cape Point, Saldana, as well as Shoprite Rite brand, Checkers Housebrand, U-Brand and OK Housebrand. Shoprite Holdings says all cans identified with these batch codes have since been removed from the shelves.
