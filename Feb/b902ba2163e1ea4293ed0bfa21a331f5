The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it has no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s ability to chair the African Union (AU). Ramaphosa assumed the position at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. However, EFF leader Julius Malema says the continent will be able to see that Ramaphosa wants to be in power and lacks the ability to lead. Malema was addressing the media in Centurion in Pretoria on Sunday. “At least the continent will get to see what we see here in South Africa. A man who wants to be on top and do nothing, that’s Cyril Ramaphosa. So it gives the opportunity for the continent to see that we are not being unreasonable, we are being led by a person who has no vision, who does a lot of talking and no action,” says Malema.  Meanwhile, the EFF has vowed to disrupt the State of the Nation Address (SONA) in the National Assembly chamber on Thursday. The party says it will make sure that Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan is shown the door and he vacates his position in government. Malema says as soon as Ramaphosa takes to the podium to deliver the address, they’ll start to demand that Gordhan be removed from the chamber.
