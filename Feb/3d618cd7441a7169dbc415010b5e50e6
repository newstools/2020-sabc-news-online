The Competition Commission has extended by one month the deadline for mobile network operators to reach an agreement over data prices. In December 2019 the Commission released its final report on the Data Services Market Inquiry, which recommended that MTN and Vodacom, which hold the majority share in the countryâ€™s mobile industry, to reach a deal to reduce date prices. The Commission says it has had productive engagements with Vodacom, MTN and other mobile operators and the extension is to allow for the conclusion of these engagements. The report also recommended that these operators reach agreement with the Commission on other pro-poor measures within three months, including free data. Related video click below:
