Sentencing proceedings in the case of former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli and co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi, are expected to resume on Tuesday morning in the High Court in Johannesburg. The case relates to the 1999 murder of Oupa Ramogibe, who allegedly had an affair with Mdluli’s customary wife Tshidi Buthelezi. In July last year, Mdluli and Mthunzi were found guilty of intimidation, kidnapping and assault. However, in November, Mdluli was acquitted on all four counts of intimidation. This followed the Constitutional Court ruling that certain sections of the Intimidation Act were unconstitutional.  The former crime intelligence head and his co-accused Mthmbeni Mthunzi, who’s also a former police officer, will be back in the dock on Tuesday where their sentencing proceedings are expected to begin. These proceedings were due to begin on Monday. However, the matter had to be rolled over due to the defence not having yet been furnished with the revised judgement. This comes after Mdluli was acquitted of four counts of intimidation he was found guilty of in July last year. Mdluli was acquitted of the charges after the unanimous judgment by the Constitutional Court which ruled that certain sections of the Intimidation Act were unconstitutional, finding that they limited the right to freedom of expression.
