The Executive of The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) is expected to meet with Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande in Durban on Monday. The meeting is to discuss the ongoing challenges affecting the University. The academic programme has once again been suspended indefinitely, at all the campuses. Last week, the University saw sporadic violent protest action on many of its campuses. Students are demanding accommodation and that historic debt be written off.  Executive Director of Communications at UZKN Ashton Bodrick says, “The academic programmes have been suspended until further notice for the safety and security of the students and staff. Partly because we are in negotiations, we will be discussing at a meeting on Tuesday with the SRC leadership on all the issues. We are trying to resolve their issues of registration, historic debt etc. However registration for undergraduate and postgraduate is continuing this week.”
