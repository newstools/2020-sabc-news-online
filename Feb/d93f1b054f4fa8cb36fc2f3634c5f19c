Murder accused Yolanda Nogemane has been suspended by the University of Fort Hare, Eastern Cape. She is accused of the murder of fellow student Yonela Boli, who was fatally wounded in a stabbing incident, two weeks ago. It is alleged that an argument ensued between the two in on the 9th of February following a night of drinking. The 24-year-old student was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his wounds. The suspension comes after Nogemane was granted bail of R1 000 in the Alice Magistrate’s Court. University of Fort Hare Spokesperson Thandi Mapukata says, “In line with the university policy, any student that is deemed to have committed a transgression that warrants an investigation by the university then fit in the category that should be suspended and not come close to the university, depending on the nature of the transgression. So, in her case, the University was not going to be able to run ahead of the law. So when she was given a bail, the university processes needed to kick in,” explains Mapukata. The SRC at the University has expressed disappointment after Nogemane was granted bail by the Alice Magistrate’s Court. In the video below, students are calling for no bail for Nogemane:
