The Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) National Spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, has highlighted various struggles faced by learners and the education system. This follows the death of Enock Mpianzi who died while at a Grade 8 orientation camp last month. Mpianzi, from Parktown Boys’ High School in Johannesburg, drowned at the Nyathi Bush and Riverbreak Lodge in the North West. The 13-year-old disappeared when a makeshift raft – that he and other boys were on – overturned on the Crocodile River. Mpianzi will be laid to rest on Saturday at Westpark cemetery. Ndlozi was speaking at Mpianzi’s funeral at Kensington High School, in Johannesburg. “They can’t keep schools in South Africa, proper schooling facilities, school books arrive late, schools in the townships are degenerating. So, that is the pain of losing a child – because of a society that does not care for its children. Enock may have been young. His story has caused the necessary storm in South Africa that we’ve got to remember all the children in boys schools in which initiation cultures are abusive and negligent. His death and story has arisen and made the country debate all those conditions of general neglect.”  Meanwhile, Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko, says the department is to reassess policies relating to extramural activities at schools – to help ensure learners are kept safe. Mazibuko was also speaking at Mpianzi’s funeral in Johannesburg. “We shall make sure that the family gets to know the truth as that will be uncovered by the investigations that are still under way. We will also use the findings to ensure that gaps and lapses that may occur in the safety of young people in our care are immediately addressed. Through the death of Enock, the department will make sure that it relooks at policies of extramural activities at our schools.” Click on the video below:
