Doctor Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has hung up his mic as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) National Spokesperson. He made the announcement at the media briefing in Centurion, south of Pretoria. Ndlozi, however, says he’s not leaving the EFF. He’ll head the party’s political education. Vuyani Pambo and Delisile Ngwenya have taken over from him. These were Ndlozi’s final words to the media. “I just want to thank you, colleagues, for the good relations we had, and even for the bad ones. Mr President has said for those we are not apologetic, andiyi ndawo. I’m duly elected Commissar of the EFF and I’m still around and will work for this organization because it’s the future and no one can stop it. I want to wish both commissars, Delisile Ngwenya and Vuyani Pambo the best and please treat them well,” says Ndlozi. Meanwhile, EFF leader Julius Malema says he’s party will make sure that the DA’s move to have Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane removed from office does not succeed. The National Assembly Rules that were passed towards the end of 2019 outline the processes that have to be followed to initiate the removal of heads Chapter 9 institutions. Malema says there’s a united action by the DA and the President Cyril Ramaphosa faction of the ANC to see Mkhwebane out because of the findings she has made against Ramaphosa on the CR17 campaign Bosasa donation. Addressing the media in Centurion, south of Pretoria, Malema said Mkhwebane was going nowhere. “We are aware that parliament has entered the frivolous motion of the DA to remove Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane as the Public Protector. We’ll oppose this move, which is a united action by the DA and the Ramaphosa faction in the ANC to the end. We have no doubt that this motion will be defeated.”
