The NPA has confirmed that the case against former Aurora Empowerment Systems directors Khulubuse Zuma, Zondwa Mandela and Thulani Ngubane has been struck from the Springs Regional court roll. The former Aurora heads were facing charges relating to the contravention of the Water Act. The trio were accused of failing to prevent acid mine drainage from contaminating the Blesbokspruit river which is one of the tributaries of the Vaal river, a key water source for Gauteng.  At a previous postponement  of the case in November 2019, Chief legal officer for the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse, Advocate Stefanie Fick, expressed disappointment at the postponement. “This has been dragging since 2010 and we all need to remind ourselves the victims of this that finally people should be held accountable.” In the video below, OUTA talks about the frustrations regarding the case and postponements. The accused’s  lawyer explains why the postponements were necessary.
