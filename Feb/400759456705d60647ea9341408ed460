The murder case against a 25-year old man accused of killing an intern doctor has been postponed to March 31 at the Mankweng Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo. This is to allow for further investigations. Ntiyiso Shilumane appeared for the second time in court for allegedly killing 24-year-old Shongile Nkwashu in January at the Mankweng hospital. Hospital CEO Eva Kobola says they are hopeful that justice will be served. “As health professionals we remain determined, we will continue to come and support the family and also as the hospital we are interested in the outcome of this case, we have trust in our justice system,  we believe they will not disappoint us.”
