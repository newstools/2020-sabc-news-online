The Chinese community in South Africa has pleaded for an end to the discrimination against them in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Called Covid-19, the virus is said to have originated in a fish market in the city of Wuhan in China’s Hubei province. Since the outbreak was first reported at the end of December 2019 more than 1700 people have died while more than 70 00 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
