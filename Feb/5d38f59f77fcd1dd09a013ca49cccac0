The United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) and Unicef say the fight against Female Genital Mutilation, which is practised in 30 countries, will continue unabated. In 2012, the 6th February was declared as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM. In the Eastern Cape, the Basotho BaTlokwa tribe at Mt Fletcher and Matatiele enrolls not less than a hundred young girls annually to undergo the practice. UNPFA East and Southern Africa Deputy Director Justin Coulson says this is an extreme human rights violation. “It’s a harmful practice that violates the rights of women and girls. It either involves the partial or the total removal of the female genitalia normally for culture with no medical practices. People forcibly holding down a young girl against her consent, whilst the community female member uses a blunt blade very often dirty without an aseptic to remove genitalia. Surely you can understand how gruesome and traumatic this is for young girls.”  However, those who believe in the practice say preserving this custom is important for young girls, as they learn about the importance of traditions. BaTlokwa chief, Montoeli Lehane remains unmoved about female genital mutilation “You know, this practice of female circumcision, it is so important in our women, wives and girls because it restores their dignity and respect and also to maintain the identity. As long as you are, we are a Tlokwa. You must know what the custom entails.” Watch a related video below:
