Energy expert Chris Yelland says the government can manage to solve the energy crisis within a reasonable period of time if it starts taking practical steps. Yelland was reacting to measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa during the State of the Nation Address that government plans to implement to curb the crisis at Eskom. Ramaphosa mentioned some emergency procurement as part of a short term solution, a move that Yelland does not agree with. He says there are better alternatives such as including the public and municipalities in the solution. “The President alluded to emergency procurement. Personally I think this is a waste of time, there are short term options that don’t need emergency procurement, getting customers to become part of the solution. These are solutions that can be delivered in six months to 18 months. All that it takes is removal of red tapes and to get on with the job.” “I think we really need to start seeing some signals that this is more than just talk. The other area that I think can deliver great rewards that were referred to by the President was allowing municipalities to become part of the solution.” President Cyril Ramaphosa delivering #SONA2020 Speech on Thursday:
