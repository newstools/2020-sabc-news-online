Tanzanian investigative journalist Erick Kabendera has been set free after spending seven months in prison. The journalist, who works for local and foreign publications, has a reputation for writing articles critical of authorities. His release comes after entering a plea-bargain arrangement with the Director of Public Prosecutions. The plea bargain that secured his freedom saw him convicted on charges of tax evasion and money laundering; a charge for involvement in organised crime has been dropped. Kabendera credits fellow journalists with helping him get through what he describes as a trying time. “I want to thank fellow practitioners who stood with me in prayers and in comfort. Many of you came to greet me at Segerea prison, you brought me books and newspapers and you encouraged me to stand firm in the situation I was facing.” In the video below, Erick Kabendera receives news about his mother’s death while still in prison.  The case has attracted a great deal of attention in Tanzania with local and international journalists closely following proceedings. Kabendera’s release from prison comes after a long battle in court and as welcome news to the many journalists and well-wishers that eagerly followed up on the case. He was first arrested in July 2019 when authorities questioned his citizenship. In the video below, HRW expresses concern over media freedom in Tanzania.  A police investigation brought further charges related to economic sabotage. Under Tanzanian law, Kabendera was not eligible for bail, leading to his seven-month stay behind bars. Newly-passed legislation on plea bargains helped secure his freedom.
