The family of a 14-year-old boy that was allegedly raped in a mental hospital in the Eastern Cape is still waiting for hospital management to provide answers and investigate the case. It’s alleged the teenager was raped by another patient a day after he was admitted to the Komani Mental Hospital in 2019. Workers at the hospital downed tools earlier this week over staff shortages, safety and inadequate beds. Provincial Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba is expected to visit the hospital next week. A family member, who wished to remain anonymous, says they only found out about the rape a while after the incident because the boy was always sedated and was too traumatised to speak. “The second day after his admission, he was raped by a fellow patient and we were not aware of that because every time when we visited him, he was under drugs and he couldn’t speak. He couldn’t eat; he was just lying there all the time.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
