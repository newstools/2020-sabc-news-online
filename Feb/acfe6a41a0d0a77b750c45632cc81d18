Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it’s not expecting anything outstanding from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) this coming Thursday. Party Secretary General, Marshall Dlamini says Ramaphosa has never had a plan on how to grow the economy and has no idea what needs to be done to fast-track land expropriation in the country. The EFF is holding its Annual Plenum, a strategic planning meeting that seeks to pave a way for the year 2020 in Centurion, Pretoria. This is where it will also decide whether to disrupt the SONA in Parliament or not. Dlamini says more needs to be done to improve the economy. “In terms of the economy, we’ve got challenges where we cannot supply guaranteed energy to the industry. So, that affects the economy and the economy of South Africa is not growing. But we are not expecting much from Cyril because he had never said anything. He has never had a plan. So, we’ll go and do our work as mandated by the constitution and as rules of Parliament as the Members of Parliament,” says Dlamini.   Watch a related video below:
