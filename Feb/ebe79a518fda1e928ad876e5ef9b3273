Eskom says no load shedding is expected on Sunday. The power utility says the generation system has improved with the successful return of a unit and adequate emergency reserves. It has however reminded customers that the system remains constrained and vulnerable and has warned that it could implement load shedding at short notice. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshatsha says,”We have had a generating unit coming back to service at the Medupi Power Station. Another two generating units are expected to get back to service later in the day. That, together with stabilised unplanned breakdowns has allowed us to carry on without actually implementing load shedding. We have our unplanned breakdowns at 10900 MegaWatts. Planned units are at 6-thousand MegaWatts” says Eskom’s spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshatsha. Announcement of no load shedding on Sunday   Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe announced earlier in February that the country’s power utility Eskom faced two years of load shedding. This in contrast to Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter saying that load shedding can be expected for the next 18 months as it catches up on maintenance.
