Former Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi has died at the age of 95. He was the East African country’s longest-serving president, occupying the office for 24 years – from 1978 until 2002. He died in Nairobi where he had been receiving treatment. Initially, when he took over power, he was said to be a soft-spoken person, but after an attempted coup in the country in 1982, President Moi is said to have changed tactics and ruled the country with an iron fist. His legacy was also dogged with claims of corruption, some even claiming that his family enriched themselves from public coffers. But it is also during his legacy that the education system in Kenya was reformed. Some will also say that it was during his legacy that the country was able to establish itself as an economic giant in the East African region, so quite a mixed legacy that President Moi will leave behind.
