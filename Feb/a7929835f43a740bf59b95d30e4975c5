The family of murdered Gauteng learner, Laticia Jansen, say they feel let down by the police.  They have accused the police of shoddy work in their investigation in her murder. The body of the Grade 9 Graceland Education Centre learner was found in thick bushes in Elsburg in the East Rand last month. She was raped, bludgeoned to death and burnt. No one has been arrested for her murder and police say investigations are continuing.  Her funeral service was held in Dukathole on Saturday. Jansen’s uncle Steven who discovered her body says the police have failed the family. “By the time they came here they never took the bags for evidence.  Even now you can see there’s still evidence around here.  This is a used condom.  It is still the same way even the time we come and put the cross and everything.  It was here even now it is here,” says Steven.
