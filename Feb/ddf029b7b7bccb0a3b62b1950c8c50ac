Democratic Alliance (DA) member of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, Mbali Ntuli, says the party has to change how it is doing things and use the crisis it currently finds itself in to re-evaluate its purpose. Ntuli says she believes the DA should have policies that can be realistically implemented in the near future. “I think if we can ensure that we have policies that speak to the realities of South Africans, that are empathetic, kind and implementable, then we’ll really inspire people to look at the Democratic Alliance as a vehicle to start changing the country,” says Ntuli. Ntuli says she doesn’t believe that DA Federal Council Chairperson, Helen Zille and interim leader John Steenhuisen will lead the party towards a direction that solves its problems.
