Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko has called on the Department of Education to register all those that sell items at schools. This follows the arrest of a cake seller after 16 Ikusasalethu High School pupils in Soweto suffered food poisoning after eating so called “space cookies,” which are also known as dagga cakes, and were subsequently rushed to hospital last week. They have all since been discharged. MEC Mazibuko says the department and parents need to know what is being sold to the learners. “We wish to call upon MEC of education that they must start registering all people that are selling at the schools. Because once you know who is selling and who is selling what, you would be able to avert such things. A 21-year-old has been arrested. I suspect she overdosed this time because she says they are in demand. We need parents also to come on board; you must know what your children are eating at school. We have been fighting drugs that have been sold through the fences, now it’s obvious they are bringing them straight into the schools using some of the learners,” says Mazibuko. Two learners have been suspended for allegedly helping with the sale of “space cookies”.  Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona says the suspended learners – who have been released into their parents’ custody –  are to face a disciplinary hearing. “The two learners that were suspected to have sold the said cakes were then apprehended by the police. But then released because of them being minors. We also understand that the woman, who owns the cake business, was also arrested and detained at Dobsonville. The two boy learners were suspended with immediate effect. They will be appearing on February 24 at their disciplinary process.”
