Editorial Note: Earlier the SABC reported that a warrant of arrest was issued for Malema and his co-accused, Adrian Snyman, because they both failed to appear in court on Monday morning. However, it has since been established that Malema and Snyman not appearing in court was by agreement with the court and that the arrest warrant was procedural. A warrant of arrest has been issued for Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and his co-accused. This as they did not appear at the East London Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning. The execution of the warrant has been stayed to the 8th of May, for his next appearance. Malema is facing five counts of discharging a firearm in a public space. This after Malema allegedly discharged a rifle during the EFF’s fifth anniversary celebrations at the Sisa Dukashe stadium in Mdantsane in 2018. The five counts Malema is charged with include unlawful possession of fire arm, unlawful possession of ammunition, discharge of a fire arm in a built up area, failure to take reasonable precaution to persons or property, and reckless endangerment to person or property. The case was postponed for the state to provide the defence with the docket contents and a video footage taken on the day.
