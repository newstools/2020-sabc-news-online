The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s interim leader John Steenhuisen has vowed to unite the party and end the culture of what he terms “ugly campaigning”. Steenhuisen was outlining his plans for the DA’s top position at the launch of his leadership campaign in Cape Town. The elective congress takes place in early April. Steenhuisen was elected interim leader following the resignation of Mmusi Maimane from the top post last year. Steenhuisen’s major challengers are Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, KZN legislature member, Mbali Ntuli and Gauteng leader John Moodey. Steenhuisen says under his leadership, the toxic culture of leaks and personal attacks within the party will come to an end. “We cannot win if we don’t pull in the same direction. Where there is a lack of discipline, everybody in the DA suffers, everybody suffers. So I’m going to ensure that we build a new culture in the DA, that we build a culture of working together, of team work, of trying to achieve the same goals and of pulling in the same direction. We’ve got to end this toxic culture of leaks, personal spheres and ugly campaigning because if we don’t end it it’s going to end the Democratic Alliance.” The official opposition was rocked last year by the resignations of Herman Mashaba and Athol Trollip. The party also lost control of the Joburg Metro to the ANC and lost support in the national elections – mainly to the FF Plus. The DA last year elected Helen Zille as Federal Council Chairperson. Steenhuisen says the country needs strong and ethical leaders.
