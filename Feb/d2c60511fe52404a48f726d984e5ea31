The health authorities in Botswana say they are reviewing screening procedures in order to screen all passengers arriving from China and not just those exhibiting flu-like symptoms associated with the Coronavirus. Five people are being quarantined in the country, of which four were identified only after they started exhibiting flu-like symptoms associated with the virus. Authorities are in the process of identifying and locating people that may have been in contact with the four patients. Dr Malaki Tshipayagae from Botswana’s Ministry of Health says although it has not been confirmed that the virus can be transmitted via asymptomatic patients, they want to ensure all passengers are screened appropriately in order to stem the spread of the virus. “We are reviewing our surveillance approach to see what may be the most ideal, because we may be thinking that passengers coming from China may not have the Coronavirus while indeed they have. So we are in the process of reviewing our surveillance in line with what the international community is doing,” explains Dr Tshipayagae. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
