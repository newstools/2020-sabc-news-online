The US Senate on Wednesday acquitted Donald Trump of abuse of power in his historic impeachment trial, the first of two charges brought against the Republican president that forced senators to vote on whether to remove him from office. The businessman-turned-politician, 73, faced only the third presidential impeachment trial in US history – his turbulent presidency’s darkest chapter – after being impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on December 18 on charges arising from his conduct toward Ukraine. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 52-48 to acquit him of abuse of power stemming from his request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 3 election. One Republican, Mitt Romney, joined the Democrats in voting for conviction. No Democrats voted for acquittal. A two-thirds majority in the 100-seat Senate is needed to remove him under the US Constitution. There are 53 Republican senators.
