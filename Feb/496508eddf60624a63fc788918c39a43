The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will this week focus its attention on Mhlathuze Water – which was under the leadership of embattled former South African Airways (SAA) board chair Dudu Myeni. The commission will look at the conduct of the board – during 2015 and 2016. Evidence has revealed what appears to be an elaborate scheme of looting designed to siphon money out of the company. Evidence leader of the commission, advocate Kate Hofmeyr told the commission on Monday morning – they also have a witness whose identity will remain anonymous – because he is facing death threats. The unnamed witness has implicated former President Jacob Zuma, Myeni and her son Thalente Myeni and other senior officials in his testimony.   A teary Hofmeyr says, “Finalising the witness evidence has not been an easy feet chair and the reason for that is that quite simply he fears for his life in giving this evidence. The threat to him and his family in giving this evidence has been assessed by the security protection of the commission and has been found to be real and credible.” “And of Saturday he has been placed in the custody of those services and he was only able to meet with the legal team for the first time yesterday [Sunday]. Notice was given to the persons who will be implicated in his evidence,” adds Hofmeyr.  Watch:
