The Democratic Alliance(DA) has welcomed National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise’s decision to accept the party’s new motion to initiate proceedings to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane from office. On Wednesday, Modise indicated that the DA’s new motion complied with the Rules of the National Assembly. The DA initially submitted a motion in December last year to have Mkhwebane removed but lodged a new motion on Friday after presenting new evidence that the party says strengthens its case to have Mkhwebane removed.  The next step in the proceedings is the establishment of a panel of three people that will determine if there is a prima facie case for Mkhwebane’s removal. Newly adopted rules for the removal of heads of Chapter Nine institutions require that an independent panel must be established, after which an ad hoc committee will make its findings. Political parties have been invited again to nominate people to serve on the panel before March 6th.
