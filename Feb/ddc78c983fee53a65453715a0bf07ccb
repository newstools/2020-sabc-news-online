Two more learners have died in Gauteng bringing the death toll of school pupils since the start of the new school year to 18. On Friday, a Grade 5 learner from the Diepsloot Primary School died after being struck by lightning while walking home from school while another learner from Zenzeleni Primary School in Alexandra died at home after a short illness.  Gauteng’s Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona says a Psycho Social Team will be visiting both schools. “It is alleged that the said girl learner was struck by lightning on Friday 21 February 2020, while walking home with fellow learners from school in the afternoon. Our Psycho Social Team will be visiting both schools to render the necessary support and counseling. We wish to send our heartfelt condolences to both families and the community at large and at school. We are with them during this time of grief.” Earlier this week, a 17-year-old learner from Lofentse Girls High School in Soweto was taken in for questioning and counselling. This is after 47 learners fell ill and were rushed to various hospitals after allegedly eating the space cakes she was selling.
