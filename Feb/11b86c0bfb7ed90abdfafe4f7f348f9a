Cash strapped power utility, Eskom, has warned that the loadshedding situation could change at short notice because of aging and unpredictable power plants – and says stage three power cuts are to continue until Monday morning. Eskom says unplanned outages stand at over 11 000 megawatts. It says loadshedding is set to continue for 18 months as the utility seeks to catch up on maintenance. Eskom has urged people to save power by setting air-conditioners at 23 degrees celsius, using the cold tap rather than the hot tap and switching off geysers during peak periods – among other things. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says: “Due to the shortage of generating capacity, and unreliable and unpredictable generation plant, it is necessary to implement loadshedding in order to protect the entire electricity system from collapse. We are continuing with replenishing our dam levels and that is what stage 3 is helping us with.”
