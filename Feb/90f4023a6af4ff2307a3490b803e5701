The Labour Court will on Thursday morning hear an urgent application filed by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the South Africa Cabin Crew Association to interdict the Business Rescue Practitioners at South African Airways (SAA) from taking any steps that could lead to job losses at the airline. The unions also want the Business Rescue Practitioners to comply with the terms of the wage agreement signed last year compelling the employer to re-train workers facing retrenchments. Last week, the airline announced that it will be cancelling 11 local, international and regional routes. Numsa National Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says they want SAA to follow proper processes and they’re hopeful the court will rule in the workers’ favour. “The application is with respect to a request for the court to order the BRP not to proceed with retrenchments outside of a section 189 process. This is because last week the BRP told workers in a meeting that there was a need for massive retrenchments at SAA, and that they would have to happen quickly outside of a section 189 process.” WATCH | Who should call the shots now that SAA is under business rescue?
