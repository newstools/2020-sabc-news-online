Police Minister Bheki Cele says the killing of police members is an attack on the country. He was speaking at the Viljoenskroon funeral service in the Free State of police officer Galeshewe Poonyane, who died in the line of duty. He was shot and killed and his female colleague wounded when they intercepted a suspicious vehicle near Orkney in North West. The two police officers were confronting suspects in a car they had followed from Vierfontein in the Free State. Minister Cele raised concern that many police officers have been killed by foreign nationals.  “When you talk about these things, it sounds like you are xenophobic. We are not saying South Africans are not committing crime but it’s extraordinary that they move from their country and come here undocumented in the process of becoming South Africans and begin to attack and kill people, worse the law enforcers of South Africa.” WATCH BELOW:
