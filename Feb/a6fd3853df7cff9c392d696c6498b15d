Nelson Mandela Bay Member of the Mayoral Committee for Infrastructure and Engineering, Andile Lungisa, has lambasted the Democratic Alliance (DA) for laying criminal charges against him. DA members led by caucus leader, Jonathan Lawack, laid criminal charges against Lungisa accusing him of contravening the Municipal Finance Management Act by allegedly intervening in the municipal tender processes. Lungisa refuted the allegations and instead accused the DA of pulling a stunt to revive itself in the Metro. “There is no case against me. An organisation called the DA which has long perished in the Nelson Mandela Metro, he is trying to revive it as a party leader, which is not going to work. He must just focus on his own organisation, there is no case, there is no issue,” says Lungisa.
