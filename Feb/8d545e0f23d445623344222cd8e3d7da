A Grade 8 learner from Thutokitso Secondary in the west of Johannesburg has died after allegedly being stabbed to death by a learner from Fochville Secondary in the same region. It’s alleged that the Grade 12 girl attacked the boy in the Kokosi township on Friday not far from both schools. This brings to five the number of deaths in Gauteng schools in the first week of February. Police are investigating circumstances surrounding this incident. “This is unbelievable indeed. The police were on the scene and they have started to investigate circumstances surrounding this incident. Our psycho-social team will on Monday visit both schools,” says Gauteng Department of Education Steve Mabona.    This follows recent bullying incidents in schools across the Gauteng province. Last week , a learner was thrown on concrete by a fellow learner at Roodepark High School in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. The learner involved in the incident was admitted to hospital and treated for bleeding on the brain. Watch  a related video below:
