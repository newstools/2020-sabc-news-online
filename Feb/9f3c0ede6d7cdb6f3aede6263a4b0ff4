The former head of procurement at South African Airways (SAA) Technical (SAAT) Nontsasa Memela will on Monday conclude her testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, at Parktown, Johannesburg. Last week the former head of department denied all allegations of bribery and wrongdoing in which she had been implicated by two witnesses. She told the commission she did not see a conflict of interest when a bidding company paid R2.5 million towards the purchase of her property. The infographic below highlights past testimonies.  JM Aviation director Vuyo Ndzeku purchased land from Memela’s mother for R2.5 million but the money transferred to pay for a house in Bedfordview for Memela worth 3.8 million. JM Aviation and its American-based partner AAR Corporation secured a R1.2-billion contract with SAAT to supply aircraft components in 2016. Memela said she did not see any conflict of interest when she sat in the committee that approved AAR and JM Aviation’s tender application despite having a cosy relationship with one of the bidding directors.
