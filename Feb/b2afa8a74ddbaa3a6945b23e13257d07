Police have mobilised their 72-hour activation plan to track down five suspects who shot and killed a police officer and a security guard in the east of Johannesburg on Saturday. The policeman was travelling with the security guard and a woman when the suspects opened fire on the vehicle at the corner of the R562 and M57 in Elandsfontein, near Tembisa. “On Saturday morning at about 10.30 an Ivory Park policeman and a security guard were gunned down just around the Tembisa area. They were travelling together with a woman, a civilian when they came under attack by at least five gunmen. The policeman and the security guard were killed instantly and the woman escaped unscathed. At this stage we don’t know what the motive for the attack was. We’re appealing to anyone with any information to contact us on the crime stop 086 00 1011 or they can provide us with tip-offs on the SAPS MySAPS app. All information will be treated with strictest confidence and callers may remain anonymous,” says National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo.
