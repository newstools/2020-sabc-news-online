In an effort to curb alcohol abuse among learners, the Eastern Cape Liquor Board has handed over 16 CCTV cameras to the Qonce High School in King Williams Town to monitor learner movements. The board’s spokesperson, Mgwebi Msiya, says the action is a result of complaints about learners jumping over the school fence to go to taverns during school hours. “The initiative that we decided up on was to install the cameras so that the school can monitor and observe the movement in the school and be able to know the whereabouts of their kids. Today we were handing them over they are fully functional and the school now is able to monitor kids during break time and lessons,” says Msiya. The Eastern Cape Education department welcomes the initiative. Departmental spokesperson, Loyiso Pulumani, says it will curb the abuse of  alcohol by learners. “We appreciate their vigorous and ongoing advocacy campaign which will work to assist the department in ensuring that we curb underage drinking and use of drugs in our schools. The programme identifies the hotspots in the province and go there and conduct the programmes,” says Pulumani. Watch: Aware’s Ingrid Louw explains responsible alcohol advertising
