The ANC has rejected the resignation of the partyâ€™s National Youth Task Team co-ordinator, Sibongile Besani. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule says they expect Besani to go back to his duties as the NYTT co-ordinator with immediate effect.  Besani tendered his resignation last week after media statements by the ANC Youth League in Limpopo, KwaZulu Natal and the Free State. They lashed out at Judge Dhaya Pillay for issuing a stayed warrant of arrest for former president Jacob Zuma if he fails to appear in the Pietermaritzburg High Court in May.  The National Working Committee of the ANC met to discuss this and has called on all Youth League members to exercise maximum discipline ahead of the national elective conference in March.
