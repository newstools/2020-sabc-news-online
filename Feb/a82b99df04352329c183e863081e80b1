The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday warned of the possibility of a community spread of the coronavirus in the country after a person who reportedly did not have relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient was infected. The infection was detected in California, bringing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States to 15, according to the agency. Community spread is the spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown.
