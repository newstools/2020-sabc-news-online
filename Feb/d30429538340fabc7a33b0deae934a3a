The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Limpopo is accusing Premier Stan Mathabatha of failing to take action against people implicated in alleged corrupt activities in the province. EFF leader Jossey Buthane in the province says Mathabatha has failed to act on the recommendations in the Public Protector’s report against former Transport MEC, Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana and the former MPL Lehlogonolo Masoga, who allegedly misused state funds. Buthane was speaking after the state of the province address in Polokwane. “He’s dismally failing to deal with corruption … These are the recommendations, I wrote a letter to you and say pay half of the money. How much did Mapula Mokaba pay to date. Lehlogonolo Masoga has even left. How much did Lehlogonolo Masoga pay this money that continues to disappear in Sekhukhune … three times (we wrote a letter)! We don’t think that he’s in touch with the ground and that is the problem,” says Buthane. In this video below Mathabatha addresses his  SOPA speech:
