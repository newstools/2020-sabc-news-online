Residents of Kagiso west of Johannesburg have taken to the streets in protest over service delivery issues. All entry points into the township have been closed.  Residents are accusing the Mogale City Local Municipality of corruption relating to the selling of RDP houses at Chief Mogale and Ext 13 whereas deserving beneficiaries have no homes. They say tenders are awarded to companies from outside Mogale city despite there being local companies to do the job. Community leader Sello Tshukudu says they will continue if their demands are not addressed. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Kay Makhubele says police are on the scene and monitoring the situation.
