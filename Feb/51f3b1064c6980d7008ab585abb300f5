Eskom has warned that there is a probability of load shedding this weekend. The cash strapped power utility which suffered almost a decade of maladministration and corruption – implemented stage two load shedding at nine on Thursday night. It says it has lost additional generating units and experienced an increase in demand. Eskom says any further deterioration in the system could result in load shedding. It says people should be aware of the possibility of increased load shedding over the next 18 months as it now conducts critical maintenance on aging power plants. Eskom has recently been on the spotlight following weeks of load shedding with Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) proposing that it be placed under business rescue as opposed to using public servants pension funds to bail out the ailing power utility. Fedusa said it rejects the proposal brought forward by the Congress of South African Trade Unions which suggests that the Public Investment Corporation should step in to take on R250 billion of Eskom’s debt.
