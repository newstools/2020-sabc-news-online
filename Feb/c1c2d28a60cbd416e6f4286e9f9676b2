Convicted Fees-Must-Fall activist, Kanya Cekeshe, says he has no regrets. He was part of a group of people that President Cyril Ramaphosa granted a remission of sentence in December in 2020. Cekeshe was convicted of public violence and malicious damage to property when he tried to set a police van alight during university protests in 2016. Eight weeks after being let out on parole, the episode has sparked his interest in legal matter and he’s now studying law. Cekeshe explains why he has no regrets. “You don’t get into such a movement, with such ideologies at the forefront, with such a profound meaning, only for you to have regrets afterwards because then that would mean that you, yourself as a person, are literally questioning the very core values that you actually stand up for, and so, no I do not have any regrets,” says Cekeshe.
