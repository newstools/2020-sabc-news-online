The Speaker of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, Nontembeko Boyce, says they have reduced the cost of the two-day opening of the legislature by a R1 million. Boyce says they will be saving the cash by reducing the number of guests from 2 800 to 1 200. She also revealed that among the invited guests is former President Jacob Zuma. “Let me now deal with the issue of costs for hosting both the official opening and SOPA. It has often diluted the good work we do as the legislature. I think I must state that we are concerned when costs escalate and all other avenues and interventions have been applied to reduce the costs. We are proud that this year we have been able to reduce costs by merely close to a R1 million on the opening of the legislature by the reduction of the number of people who will attend the events. Amongst high profile guests invited to attend include the king and former president Zuma,” says Boyce. Boyce says the legislature is sticking with the arrangement that the first day of the opening proceedings will be addressed by King Goodwill Zwelithini. “His Majesty the King as the head of the traditional leaders in the province represents the unity of the people of KwaZulu-Natal. It is against this backdrop that the standing rules of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, specifically when you look at rule number 9, provide for an address for His Majesty to officially mark the commencement of the official programme of the Legislature. It is for this reason that we would reject any unwarranted attacks against His Majesty that seek to reduce the pivotal role that he plays. As the legislature, we wish to state categorically that we work well with His Majesty, that his guidance and council to the legislature is invaluable,” says Boyce.
