Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says he’s party will make sure that the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) move to have Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane removed from office does not succeed. The National Assembly Rules that were passed towards the end of 2019 outline the processes that have to be followed to initiate the removal of heads Chapter 9 institutions. Malema says there’s a united action by the DA and the President Cyril Ramaphosa faction of the ANC to see Mkhwebane out because of the findings she has made against Ramaphosa on the CR17 campaign Bosasa donation. Addressing the media in Centurion, south of Pretoria, Malema said Mkhwebane was going nowhere. “We are aware that parliament has entered the frivolous motion of DA to remove advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane as the Public Protector. We’ll oppose this move, which is a united action by the DA and the Ramaphosa faction in the ANC to the end. We have no doubt that this motion will be defeated,” says Malema.
