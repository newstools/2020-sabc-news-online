A march against drugs and crime has been planned for Saturday in Elsburg, east of Johannesburg. This follows the death of 15-year-old Laticia Jansen, who was raped, stabbed and killed on her way from school earlier this month. The body of the Grade 9 Graceland Education Centre learner was found in thick bushes. Her body was partially burnt. Laticia’s uncle Steven Jansen was disappointed at how the police handled the case. “By the time they came here they never took the bags for evidence. Even now you can see there’s still evidence around here. This is a used condom. It is still the same way even the time we came and put the cross and everything. It was here even now it is here,” says Jansen. [WATCH] Latecia Jansen laid to rest
