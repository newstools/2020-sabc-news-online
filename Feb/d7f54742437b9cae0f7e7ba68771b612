The Democratic Alliance (DA) has given its Mayor in George an ultimatum to resign by Wednesday. Melvin Naik and other senior municipal officials have been accused of corruption and interference in administrative processes relating to a War-On-Waste project. A forensic investigation by the provincial Department of Local Government uncovered evidence that Naik received kickbacks worth R600 000. He has since been suspended from all party activities. Naik has previously said these allegations are unfounded and have not been tested in court. The DA’s Constituency Head for George, Geordin Hill-Lewis, says Naik’s party membership will cease should he fail to resign. “This was a difficult and tough action but it was absolutely necessary to take given the seriousness of the allegations against the mayor that were uncovered and substantiated in a forensic report into alleged corruption in that municipality. That is why the DA has had to take this firm and swift action because we want voters to know that when they vote DA they get clean government,” says Hill-Lewis. Watch a related video below:
