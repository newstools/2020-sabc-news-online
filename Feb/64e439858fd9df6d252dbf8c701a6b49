Democratic Alliance (DA) Leader John Steenhuisen has welcomed Executive Mayor of Tshwane Stevens Mokgalapa’s intention to resign. Mokgalapa announced over the weekend that he will step down from his position at the end of February. Steenhuisen says the party will now initiate processes to move forward with their agenda of change in the Tshwane Metro council. He says, “Well, we obviously are interested on moving Tshwane forward and getting out of the impasse that it’s in. Given the allegations that are against the mayor around the leaked tape, we find that it is in the interest of the party and the City that the mayor step aside and allow us to be able to put forward and progress with the agenda for change in the council, and that is what we are going to do.”
