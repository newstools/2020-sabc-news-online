Police have launched a manhunt for suspects following a shooting incident which left two people dead and another one seriously wounded in Tsakane, east of Johannesburg, on Saturday. One person managed to flee from the attackers. Police have appealed to anyone that has information that may lead to arrests to contact the police. Police Spokesperson, Kay Makhubele, says the attack is believed to be taxi-related. “It is reported that a white X35 Hyundai with unknown occupants approached the taxi squad car and suddenly, multiple shots were allegedly fired from the Hyundai at the Ford Laser which was driving along Modjadji street.” Mpumalanga Taxi Association up in arms over killings of its drivers Earlier this month, the Vukanini Taxi Association in Mpumalanga described the killing of the three of its drivers as an ambush. This follows a stand-off between taxi operators and bus operators for the past two weeks. It is alleged that taxi operators are against bus operations in local townships. Roads to and from Mbalenhle township were barricaded, vehicles entering the area were hijacked and used to block roads. The association’s Chairperson Fanyana Sibanyoni says as an association they find the conduct of the police disappointing.
