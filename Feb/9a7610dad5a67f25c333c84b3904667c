At least one cash-in-transit incident has occurred every day countrywide since the beginning of the year.Â  21 of these were committed in Gauteng. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo says not all cash-in-transit incidents are categorised as heists. He says an incident is only considered as a heist if the suspects get away with money. Naidoo adds that heist gangs come up with new moda operandi every day. The chief executive of the South African Banking Risk Information Centre, Susan Potgieter says about 35 cash-in-transit incidents have taken place since January.
