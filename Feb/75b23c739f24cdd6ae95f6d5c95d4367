Lesotho’s First Lady Maesaiah Thabane has been charged with the murder of former First Lady Dipolelo Thabane. She appeared in a magistrate’s court in Maseru on Monday afternoon. Maesaiah arrived in Lesotho on Monday afternoon after fleeing the country a few weeks ago. Dipolelo Thabane was assassinated two days before the inauguration of Prime Minister Tom Thabane in 2017.  Meanwhile, witnesses in the case have requested police protection as they fear that they could be intimidated.
