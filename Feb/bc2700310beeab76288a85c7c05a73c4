The commission of inquiry into state capture will on Tuesday wrap up its testimony on Gupta-linked TNA Media breakfast contracts with SOEs. Last month, the commission heard how Transnet and Eskom spent millions on Gupta Linked TNA Media, including taking up subscription with The New Age Newspapers. Some senior Transnet and Eskom employees testified how their jobs were threatened if they failed to comply or sign contracts. The commission will this week also hear the second round of evidence from witnesses in the aviation related sector. Former Eskom chair Zola Tsotsi last month testified how Eskom was facing serious financial challenges when it extended numerous contracts with Gupta -linked TNA media. Eskom spent R59, 6 million on contracts with TNA from 2011 to 2017.   Evidence was also given by two senior  Transnet employees who explained to Justice Zondo  how procurement procedures were flaunted so Transnet could  sign sponsorship and advertising deals with TNA media. Transnet Stakeholder Relations Senior Manager, Daniel Phatlane, is scheduled to continue his testimony on Tuesday morning. Watch related video below:
