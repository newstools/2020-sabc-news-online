Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says it’s high time that Eskom takes South Africans seriously and provides them with electricity. Malema led a large crowd of EFF supporters on a march through Sandton to hand over a memorandum of grievances to Eskom CEO Andre De Ryter at the headquarters in SunningHill, north of Johannesburg. The crowd gathered at the power utility’s headquarters, after a 4-hour walk from Sandton. Malema appealed to all those who have the means to pay their electricity bills, or else face prosecution. “For us to pay these workers of Eskom, we need money. Those who can afford to pay, pay your money and pay for the poor as well. We call on Eskom CEO … there should not be anyone here in Sandton who owes electricity, if they say they aren’t employed, then they are crooks. He must pay. If they can’t pay, you must introduce a process and take them to relevant authorities.” In the video below, the EFF leader talks about their march in Sandton:  Meanwhile, De Ruyter has acknowledged that the problems at the power utility have a negative impact on people. De Ruyter says he’ll engage with the EFF leaders and find an amicable solution to the problem of load shedding in the country: “I want to thank you for caring enough about Eskom, to March peacefully all the way to Megawatt Park today, we appreciate it. We take your commitment seriously and we’ll engage with your leadership and understand your memorandum fully, we will consider and engage and debate, thank you very much.” Malema addressing the problems of load shedding in the country:
