Shocking details of Gender-based violence and Femicide (GBVF) have emerged at a gathering aimed at reducing gender based violence. Men and women have urged government to speed up dialogues to address this social ill. They were attending the Under the Tree Dialogue for men and boys in Oukasie near Brits in the North West. The event forms part of the government’s emergency response to GBVF that was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa last year. Some of the young men who attended the dialogue say government needs to speed up the rate of intervention. “As young men we should keep encouraging each other every time when we are sitting under the tree we should include issues of gender based violence.” Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, John Jeffery, says the increase of gender based violence is a worrying factor. “Unfortunately there is no switch we can press that will deal with this problem. It is something that we should work through as a society and it needs all of us to do that.” Video below is a reaction of the killings of women in the country  Ambassador for GBV Earlier this month President Cyril Ramaphosa elected reigning Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi to be an ambassador for gender-based violence on the African continent as he took the African Union chairship.
