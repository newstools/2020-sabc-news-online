Staff at Entabeni hospital in Durban have downed tools over a wage dispute. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (NEHAWU) says only skeleton staff is working during the strike. NEHAWU regional secretary Prince Mthalane says: “There was a final offer that the employer made which was declined by the employees so then it went to the CCMA and eventually the strike certificate was issued.” The employer has issued a revised offer but there is still an issue of back pay. Mthalane says: “There has been a revised offer because our position then was 7% so the employer has since revised to 6%.” “The only challenge that we have now is that there is an issue of back pay. You’ll know that increments are effective on the first of January so they want to make them effective from the first of February.”
