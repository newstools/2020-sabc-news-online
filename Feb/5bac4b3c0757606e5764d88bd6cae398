Communications Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, has called on communities to protect public resources like digital libraries. Ndabeni-Abrahams was addressing residents of Ndwedwe in Bhamshela, outside Stanger on the north coast of Durban. The address was made during the handing over of a digital library learning centre.  Learners had to travel more than 7-kilometers to the nearest library while some were forced to use their cell phones to do their research. In 2017 these learners asked President Cyril Ramaphosa for a fully-equipped centre. Ndabeni Abrahams says the government wants to develop communities in rural areas so they don’t have to leave their homes for the big cities. “Once that happens we’ll have an active citizenry that will be able to advise the government and can become an innovative society that is responsive to the fourth industrial revolution. The government wants to bridge the digital divide so that we don’t have our kids leave their areas and go to Gauteng or go to urban areas to get knowledge.”
