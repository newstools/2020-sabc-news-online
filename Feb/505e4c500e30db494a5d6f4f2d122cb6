The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the Robben Island Museum will launch Robert Sobukwe Month on Monday on the island. The first president of the PAC was initially arrested for inciting Africans to demand the repeal of pass laws and sentenced to three years in prison for treason and sabotage. At the end of his sentence in May 1963, Parliament enacted a General Law Amendment Act which was called the Sobukwe clause. This empowered the then-Minister of Justice to prolong the detention of any political prisoner indefinitely. Sobukwe was then sent to Robben Island, where he spent six years in solitary confinement before he was released and banished to Galeshewe in Kimberley. The PAC says the annual lecture to mark Sobukweâ€™s passing will be held on February 27. He died in 1978, aged 53, of lung cancer.
