Search and Rescue teams are expected to begin viewing footage taken from an aerial drone of the scene where Rebecca Mashilo went missing after being swept away by flash floods in Swanieville, west of Johannesburg, last Friday. Mashilo was heading home from work when she was overcome by the raging water. The Johannesburg Emergency Services team will also resume their search along the Jukskei river for a man who was swept away during last weekend’s flash floods at Msawawa informal settlement in Douglasdale, north of Johannesburg. Mashilo’s brother Ernest says they remain hopeful her body will be found. He says: “We will go to view the photos and we will take it from there. They will tell us what the photos reveal and if they show nothing they will continue with their search.” Watch related video below  An eight-year-old girl was also confirmed dead in Gauteng following last weekend’s floods. Her body was found on Saturday following a search by Emergency Medical Services. Her mother Maria Golelmin says her child was trying to cross a makeshift wooden bridge with her elder sister. Hundreds of people were left without shelter, especially in informal settlements in Alexandra and Soweto. Officials say Kliptown has the highest number of displaced people.
