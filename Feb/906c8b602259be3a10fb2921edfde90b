Former president Jacob Zuma’s legal team says they will not be challenging the warrant of arrest issued for their client. However, speaking outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court, Advocate Dan Mantsha expressed his concern about court’s decision to issue the warrant. Zuma, and his co-accused the French arms manufacturer, Thales are facing multiple charges including corruption, money laundering and racketeering. The charges relate to 780 questionable payments in connection with the controversial arms deal in the 1990s. Mantsha says Zuma’s doctor was willing to help the court understand the nature of his medical condition. “If the court was not understanding the format of the medical note and it was reasonable as we invited the court to stand down the matter. As I indicated to the court, the medical doctor in question has offered to explain to the judge what the situation is with the former president. The authority of the court must be protected, the administration of justice should not be put in disrepute by any of us and we are very concerned that when courts issue warrants under the circumstances like this, people start to ask whether we are all equal before the law,” says Mantsha.  The Pietermaritzburg High Court issued a warrant of arrest, stayed until May 6, for former president Jacob Zuma for failing to appear in court on Tuesday. In issuing the warrant, Judge Dhaya Pillay said it is important that the matter is treated in the same manner as in any other criminal proceedings. Earlier, State Advocate Billy Downer asked the court to issue the warrant as Zuma failed to appear for proceedings.
