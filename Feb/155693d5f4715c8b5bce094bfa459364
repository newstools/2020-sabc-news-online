The case against former security branch police officer Joao Rodrigues, who’s accused of the 1971 murder of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol, has been postponed to May 28 in the High Court in Johannesburg. The court is waiting for the finalisation of his appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Rodrigues is applying for permanent stay of prosecution in the Supreme Court after a full bench of the High Court in Johannesburg dismissed it. This after Judge Billy Mothle found that Timol died at the hands of the security branch police in the re-opened 2017 inquest, reversing the 1972 inquest finding that Timol had committed suicide at the then John Vorster Square Police Station. Rodrigues made a brief appearance in front of Judge Mohammed Ismail on Friday morning. “Mr Rodriguess, your matter is then postponed to 28 May this year. Your bail is extended, please see to it that you come to this court. Kindly return on that day by no later than 9:30am sir. If you’re here in court a warrant for your arrest will be authorised and your bail will be restricted. It’s not for trial, they’re waiting the SCA decision” Judge Ismail extended Rodrigues’s bail.
