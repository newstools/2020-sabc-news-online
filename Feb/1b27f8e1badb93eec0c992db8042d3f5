The 25-year-old man who allegedly raped a teenage boy at his bogus soccer academy in KwaMashu, north of Durban, is expected to make a formal bail application on Tuesday in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court. He was arrested two weeks ago at his home in Kloof, west of Durban. It is alleged that he drugged and raped the boy at his home after the teenager signed up to be trained at his academy. The suspect is a development coach at a well-known soccer team in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in KwaZulu-Natal. During the accused’s first appearance last week the state said it is opposing bail. The state also indicated that it still wants to verify certain information about the accused as he might have pending cases as the court heard that there is another warrant of arrest that was issued for the accused.
