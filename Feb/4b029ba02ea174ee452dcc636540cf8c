Several organisations and high-profile individuals have endorsed Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba‘s call to charge people involved in the looting of state resources and to make 2020 the year of the orange overalls. Several speakers highlighted how corruption had robbed the state of its ability to provide services and that nothing had happened to those identified. They want President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the issue during the State-of-the-Nation-Address (SONA). Business Unity South Africa Chief Executive Officer Cas Coovadia says making those responsible to account, would build confidence, including among possible investors. “Putting people into orange overalls also if I speak just from a business and economic point of view, also builds confidence in our country. A lot people we speak to actually ask, we see all these commissions, we see all the work being done but nobody going to jail. And so it’s important even for investment into the country to ensure that we do see people in orange overalls because that shows that we are not only having commissions but those commissions are bearing fruit. “ The former head of the Asset Forfeiture Unit Advocate Willie Hofmeyr says one of the reasons it is difficult to investigate corruption in South Africa is because it happens in a very organised way. He says it is not one or two bad individuals who are stealing state money but very powerful people who have been appointed to key positions to ensure that money flows to their sponsors outside the state. “ We have to find out not to the foot soldiers of who’s doing this thieving but got to find out who the people are who send them there and we’ve got to get evidence against them if we going to be effective. So that’s not always the case, I think there are some quick results,  it can happen.  But I think it’s very important that we must understand that if we clamour for quick results we may not get good results.”
