The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga says it will take major steps against all municipalities that are failing to deliver services to communities. This decision comes after a two-day provincial Lekgotla where the state of municipalities was discussed. The party says the provision of services has collapsed in municipalities forcing communities to embark on protests. A series of protest actions are experienced almost every week in the province, with residents demanding basic services such as water and proper roads. Community members are not happy with the way some municipalities provide services, while some say there is no service delivery at all. One of the municipalities that is under fire is the City of Mbombela, with residents of Umjindi protesting the merger with the Mbombela Municipality. The residents allege that no development has occurred since the merger happened in 2015. Residents have mixed feelings that the ANC will be able to root-out the infighting and corruption in municipalities to ensure that basic services are delivered. “The ANC acknowledges that there are political battles in some municipalities thus affecting the delivery of basic services. The party says it will remind councillors that they are deployed in the municipalities to service communities, not themselves,” says ANC acting secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali. Meanwhile, the party’s elective conference is scheduled to take place by the end of March. The ANC in the province is marred with factions ahead of the elective conference. Branches of the party have not launched campaigns and decided who should lead the provincial structure. However, the party says all their members have been taught and given guidelines of how people should campaign for positions. The top position is contested between the current premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane and the current acting chairperson Mandla Ndlovu.
