The The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development says its efforts to curb the outbreak of foot and mouth disease are progressing well. Spokesperson Reggie Ngcobo says the disease has been contained on some farms in the Molemole Municipal area, north of Polokwane. The outbreak has led to the ban of auctions in livestock in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and the North West. Ngcobo says they understand the frustrations of livestock farmers and auctioneers. “We understand the frustration of our auctioneers as well as our farmers, but we feel that the ban is indeed working. For the fact that we managed to contain this disease in the province of Limpopo under Molemole municipality, the people will have different ideas because it affects them directly – but we are working through the task team with all the role players to ensure that the ban is lifted so that our people can  go on with their normal auction.”  Watch related video below:
