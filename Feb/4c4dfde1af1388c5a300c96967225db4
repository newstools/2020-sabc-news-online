The Department of Health in KwaZulu-Natal says there is no laboratory confirmation of cases of coronavirus in the province. The Province’s Health MEC Nomagugu Silelane-Zulu says irresponsible and sensationalist reporting by some news media has created a false impression that there are two possible cases in the province. It says two patients who exhibited symptoms similar to the virus are being held in isolation as a precautionary measure. The Department’s spokesperson in KwaZulu-Natal, Noluthando Nkosi says one patient is being monitored in a public hospital and the other one in a private facility in Durban. “ There are a number of cases that are sent to us where there’s a level of suspicion depending on presenting features but to date, we’ve not got any case that’s positive, neither do we have any case that meets what we call the full case definition. Full case definition is when an individual that has been to the area of the epicentre of this outbreak or has been on contact with people in the epicentre and is within the incubation period and thereafter presenting symptoms,” says Acting Director-General of the National Department of Health Dr Anban Pillay. More than 500  people have died since the outbreak of the virus in China. Below is more information about the virus:
