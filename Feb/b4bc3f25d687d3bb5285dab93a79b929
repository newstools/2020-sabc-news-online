Cosatu has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to take charge and lead his administration. The labour federation has expressed concern over mixed messages from different ministers on key policy positions. Government has placed South African Airways (SAA) under business rescue and the president insisted that the state should have a major stake in the national carrier. Mineral Resource Minister Gwede Manatashe said SAA must be sold if it’s not profitable a few days after the airline was placed under business rescue. In this video below Mantashe states that SAA should be sold:  Speaking at the end of their Central Executive Committee meeting held in Johannesburg on Thursday, Cosatu President Zingiswa Losi said they would want the president to provide leadership on key policy positions. “When the ANC NEC took a decision that SAA must be saved, but majority shareholders being the government that process was underway. A minister in the cabinet says ‘why save SAA?’ So, what we are calling for is that when the ANC president leads the African National Congress and there are decisions that are taken, you expect the members of the NEC of the ANC to follow and implement these decisions. Secondly, when the President seats with his cabinet and decisions are taken you cannot expect another voice outside what was agreed to,” says Losi.  In his Budget Speech on Wednesday, Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni announced that over R16 billion has been allocated to the bankrupt SAA.
