The Commission for Gender Equality will on Monday morning launch a report in Rosebank, Johannesburg about forced and coerced sterilisations in hospitals in two provinces. The commission investigated 15 hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng after receiving a high number of complaints of alleged gross human rights violations. In the video below government could face a multi-million rand lawsuit from a group of women who say they were sterilised against their will.  Most of the complaints were lodged by the Women’s Legal Centre on behalf of Her Rights Initiative and International Community of Women Living with HIV. In the video below the Women’s Legal Centre instituted legal proceedings on behalf of two KwaZulu-Natal women, who are living with HIV.  The complaints said women living with HIV in South Africa were subjected to forced or coerced sterilisation in public hospitals. The Commission conducted the investigations over three years and will release findings on Monday morning.
