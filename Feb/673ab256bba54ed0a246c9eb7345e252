Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has called on the Lesotho government to ensure that the witnesses involved in the murder case against the country’s First Lady, Maesaiah Thabane are protected. There have been many calls on the SADC region to assist with witness protection. Maesaiah stands accused of killing Prime Minister Tom Thabane’s estranged wife Lipolelo in 2017. Mapisa-Nqakula says the region can’t be tasked with something that must be provided by a sovereign government. “If there are witnesses to this kind of case then the country must take responsibility in protecting those witnesses. I don’t think that for every little thing the government of Lesotho must take responsibility.” “It can’t be that for every little small [thing] you push to the region to take responsibility. The region is involved in big stuff, we have a mediator in the form of the president of the republic of South Africa,” explains Mapisa-Nqakula. Click below for related…
