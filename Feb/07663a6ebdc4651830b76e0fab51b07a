A case of Crimean Congo Fever has been reported in Klerksdorp in North West. A 56-year-old was admitted at the Klerksdorp Tshepong Hospital on Saturday with a history of tick bite followed by flu-like symptoms including headaches and fatigue. The North West Health Department says while no active bleeding was noted, treatment was started immediately. Crimean Congo Fever also known as Congo fever/haemorrhagic fever is a disease caused by a tick-borne virus with a case fatality of 10% to 40%. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected animal blood or ticks. It can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. Symptoms include high fever, vomiting and abdominal pain but as the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising and severe nosebleeds are also common. Clinical Manager at the Klerksdorp hospital Dr David Leburu says: “Crimen Congo Fever can make a person bleed. It can make people bleed just like Ebola but not as aggressive as Ebola.”
