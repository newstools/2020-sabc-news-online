The emerging women farmers‘ gardening project in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats has grown from a small project in 2004 to a semi-commercial entity 15 years later. The Siyazama women farmers received entrepreneurial training from the South African Institute for Entrepreneurship. The beneficiaries say the project has changed their lives and their communities. Project co-ordinator, Liziwe Stofile, says water scarcity due to climate change is one of their major challenges. “This project is six thousand square metres and we are growing a lot of different vegetables, about 20 of them. We are growing summer and winter crops, we grow all year round. It’s going very well, yeah there is a bit of challenges and also with the seasons and climate change.”
