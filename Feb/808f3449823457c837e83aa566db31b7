The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape legislature says it’s discussing the proposal to increase the number of seats in provincial legislatures. Speaker Masizole Mnqasela of the Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomed the proposal which is currently at the level of the National Speakers Forum. ANC leader in the provincial legislature, Cameron Dugmore says they will await talks on the matter. “We have not agreed that there should be more seats in the Western legislature, we have agreed to engage in a discussion. We had a discussion in the interim provincial committee of the ANC in the Western Cape that we should discuss the proposals look at the pros and cons. We have to look at the cost of such a move, additional space required and look at alternative could be improving the research capacity in support of the existing MPLs.” The Western Cape parliament has 42 seats. The ruling DA has 24 seats, the ANC 12, the EFF 2 and the GOOD Party, ACDP,  FF-Plus and Al Jammah one seat each.
