Police have launched a manhunt for an undisclosed number of suspects who allegedly stoned nine illegal miners to death in Matholeville in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg on Friday. The bodies of the miners – who are Lesotho nationals – were found lying on Enoch Sontonga street. It’s alleged that the murders were committed by the victims’ fellow Zama Zamas, also of Lesotho origin. Police spokesperson Noxolo Kweza says the 10th victim has been taken to a local hospital where he is being treated. “The suspects are now accusing the deceased of being involved in criminal activities which attract the police into their illegal mining operational space. However, this does not excuse the suspects’ actions as the law does not allow anyone to take the law into their own hands. We condemn this barbaric attack and we will ensure we leave no stone unturned in making the people of Matholeville and Roodepoort feel safe. The suspects will be arrested as soon as possible and the police will not sleep until we find them.” The suspects are expected to be charged with murder and attempted murder. Meanwhile, Provincial Police Commissioner Elias Mawela has reportedly mobilised different units from the SA Police Service (SAPS) and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that the suspects responsible for the murder of nine illegal miners are arrested.
