Several roads will be closed in the Cape Town CBD from Monday in preparation for an event to mark the 30th anniversary of the release of former President Nelson Mandela from prison on Tuesday.  Traffic spokesperson, Maxine Bezuidenhout, says restrictions will be effected in Darling Street and other nearby streets until late Tuesday. Mandela served 27-years in prison, first on Robben Island and later in the Pollsmoor and Victor Verster Prisons. He was released from the Victor Verster prison in the Boland on February 11, 1990. The Cape Town City Hall balcony is where Mandela addressed the nation hours after his release from the prison. The anniversary also marks the unbanning of political parties in South Africa and the formal end of apartheid. No vehicles will be allowed to stop in front of City Hall between Parade and Corporation Streets at certain times. Motorists have been advised to make use of alternative routes.
