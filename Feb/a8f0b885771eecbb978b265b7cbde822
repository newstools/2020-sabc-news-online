Residents in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, say they feel safer since the deployment of the Tactical Response Team (TRT), better known as Amaberete, in the area. Police Minister Bheki Cele made the announcement after protests rocked the township about two weeks ago. Community members took to the streets in protest after the murder of a police officer allegedly by a Zimbabwean national. Since the deployment over 100 foreign nationals have been arrested.  Despite this, some have expressed mixed views on the deployment. Many of them were attacked in the unrest that rocked the community and still feel unsafe while others say Amaberete have also changed their lives. “I’m from Pakistan and I’m working here in Diepsloot. These people [Amaberete] came for operation and we are safe now and don’t have any problem.” “I come from Malawi. I’m scared because here in Diepsloot people protested against people from Zimbabwe [for allegedly] killing a police officer. So I’m scared because I’m a foreigner.” “Yes we feel safe. Before, when they weren’t around we weren’t as relaxed and free. In the past few days, we knew that when the sun sets, you should be home. Their operation and the way that they’re conducting it pleases me. I’m a Zimbabwean but the death of this police officer also affected me. We are here to work, we are hard workers. Even us they are hijacking us, they are killing us.”
