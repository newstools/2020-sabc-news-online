Japan on Thursday confirmed its first coronavirus death, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said. The victim was a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, which borders on Tokyo, Kato told a news conference. He did not give further details. A cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard might have the coronavirus arrived in Cambodia on Thursday (February 13), to the relief of passengers and praise from global health officials. Meanwhile, the MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, slowly pulled itself towards port with the setting sun in the background. Adding to the dramatic effect, the ship tooted and passengers cheered as it anchor in at the port of Sihanoukville. It was earlier seen from the docks of the Cambodian port town after anchoring offshore early in the morning. People at the docks prepared to welcome passengers with bouquets of flowers, as embassy officials and Cambodian health authorities waited alongside journalists.
