The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it is not in discussions to sell its commercial radio stations and TV channel. In a statement, the public broadcaster says contrary to media reports there have not been any such discussions with government. Last week an article by Inside Politics African Narrative said there was a government document on State-Owned Enterprises that proposed the sale of Metro FM, Five FM, Good Hope FM as well as SABC 3. The SABC says rather the board has approved comprehensive assessment criteria for determining core media assets. “The SABC believes it is necessary to clarify that it is not intending to sell the assets mentioned in the article and has had no discussions with government in this regard.  As requested by National Treasury and the Ministry of Communications and Digital Technologies, the SABC is conducting a thorough process of assessing all its assets, determining which are core and non-core, taking into account a  range of factors including public mandate, licence conditions and financial contribution,” the public broadcaster clarified.
