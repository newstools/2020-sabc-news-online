The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the North West says it will open an assault case after the provincial security officials allegedly assaulted some of its party members during Friday’s State-Of-The-Province Address (SOPA). Apparently, the assault happened shortly after one member of the EFF was kicked out of the legislature.  The event started out as a standard SOPA with ceremonial frills, but proceedings soon degenerated with MPLs arguing the legitimacy of the Premier to address the house. Tensions escalated when the two EFF MPLs were dismissed from the house. This led to an altercation with security. EFF provincial secretary Papiki Babuile says they intend to open a criminal case against the security of the legislature and the person who executed the assault. “We are intending to open a criminal case against the security of the legislature and the person who actually executed the assault. We were raising on the section 100 of the constitution which places the province under administration.” The EFF says it will open a case of assault after one of their MPLs at the North West Provincial Legislature was assaulted outside by security personnel during the North West State of the Province Address.
