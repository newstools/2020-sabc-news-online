 The Timothy Omotoso court case resumes in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday after the first witness, Andisiwe Dike, took the stand on Monday. The 30-year-old witness gave chilling details on how she was allegedly sexually abused by Omotoso, who is a pastor, in his church house in Durban. Omotoso and two co-accused face a total of 97 charges between them including trafficking for sexual purposes, rape and racketeering. Andisiwe Dike has described her first three one-on-one encounters with Omotoso as scary, shocking and disgusting. She detailed a number of events, where she claims to have been shocked by Omotosoâ€™s behaviour, with the worst being when Omotoso sent for her to be called to his bedroom one evening. She told the court about how Omotoso repeatedly molested her and how she was left numb and all she could do was take a bath after. Dike said that after the first few incidents, she stopped counting as it became a regular occurrence. She said she stayed in the church house for 13 months and never told anyone about the incidents as she was warned not to discuss engagements with Omotoso.
