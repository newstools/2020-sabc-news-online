Retired South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers have appealed to young South Africans to play a more active role in shaping the future of the country. The veterans spoke during the wreath laying ceremony at the Polokwane Municipal Gardens. The ceremony is part of the commemoration of the sinking of the SS Mendi on February the 21st 1917 when 617 black South African troops died. President Cyril Ramaphosa led the ceremony in his capacity as the Commander-in-Chief of the SANDF.
