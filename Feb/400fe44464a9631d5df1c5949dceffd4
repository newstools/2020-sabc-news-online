The suspect faces three counts of rape. The sisters are said to have gone through this ordeal for a period of eight to 10 years at the Braamfischerville house, where they lived with their aunt and uncle. The state prosecutor has also indicated that there other victims, who have come forward and are giving statements claiming to have also been raped by the man. According to the state prosecutor the suspect could be classified as a serial rapist.
