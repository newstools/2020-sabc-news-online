Gauteng search and rescue teams are still trying to retrieve the body of a Kagiso woman from a dense bush in Swaneville, west of Johannesburg. 58-year-old Rebecca Mashilo went missing on Friday after being swept away by heavy rains. Second Avenue in Swanville has been blocked off by police as rescue teams try to retrieve the body. Mashilo is one of three people who went missing after flash floods over the weekend. Another rescue operation is under way in Douglasdale, north of Johannesburg, where a man was also swept away by floodwater as he was crossing a bridge. A helicopter is also hovering above to pinpoint where her body was last seen by rescue teams on Sunday. Mashilo’s family says rescue teams told them that they saw her body on Sunday but they were unable to retrieve it. They say a proper explanation was not given to them as to why they couldn’t. Scores of community members are also currently gathered at the scene.  Watch a related video below:
