Power has been restored to Metrorail train stations in the Western Cape and operations are expected to resume soon. Earlier, power utility Eskom cut power to the service over non-payment. It is understood that Prasa owes Eskom R250 million. A number of commuters have already made alternative transport arrangements. Prasa Spokesperson, Makhosini Mgitywa, says they have engaged Eskom to make a payment arrangement which led to power being restored. “Eskom cut our power because we were owing them an amount of R4 million that was due 34 days ago, which is just over a month. We have had conversations with Eskom to make them appreciate that we are unable to pay their invoice within the 14 days which they demand. However, we will be continuing to engage them so that we make them appreciate the fact that Prasa is having cashflow crunch,” says Mgitywa. In the video below, Prasa Spokesperson, Makhosini Mgitywa, confirms that power has been restored.    Prasa says Eskom disconnected power to metrorail as a result of an overdue payment of 34 days. The power utility had apparently wanted Prasa must pay within 14 days of receiving an invoice, which has now changed following negotiations between the two parties and some payment having been made by Metrorail to Eskom on Thursday afternoon. Earlier Acting Regional Manager of Rail Operations in the Western Cape, Raymond Maseko, said they were engaging Eskom to try and resolve the situation.
