Mlungisi Ranaka was gunned down at his home at Mfuleni area in Cape Town. Anyone with information should contact the crime stop number on 08600 10 111 or to send tip-offs on the MYSAPS app. “The National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla Sitole has instructed the police in the Western Cape to hunt down the suspects responsible for the killing of a special task force member. It is reported that four men stormed into Ranaka’s home and demanded that he give them his service firearm but he did not have it with him at his home.
