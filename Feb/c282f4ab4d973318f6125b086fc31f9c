South African Airways (SAA) has welcomed Travel Insurance Consultants’ (TIC) decision to reinstate insurance for SAA travellers. The Travel Insurance Consultants have reinstated the travel supplier insolvency cover on the airline with immediate effect. Both TIC and the Bryte Insurance Company will now offer essential insurance services across the travel trade and provide protection for customers choosing to fly with SAA. This means that travel agents such as Flight Centre will recommence selling SAA tickets at their outlets. The insurers had withdrawn insurance cover to SAA due to concerns over the systemic problems and uncertainty over its financial sustainability and longevity. Last year, SAA endured a crippling strike by unions that cost the airline millions per day. SAA Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Deon Fredericks, says the move is an important step for the airline and its customers. [Watch]  NTM’s Mashudu Raphetha speaks on SAA
