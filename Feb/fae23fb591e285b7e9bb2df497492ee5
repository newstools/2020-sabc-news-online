The rape case against a prominent family law advocate and acting Labour Court Judge has been postponed to the 13th of March at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. The accused was arrested and charged in 2017 after he was alleged to have molested and raped a family friend’s child since she was 5-years-old. He is facing two counts of rape, two counts of sexual molestation as well as two counts of sexual grooming. The advocate and acting Judge made a brief appearance in the dock before his trial was postponed to allow the state time to investigate an alibi that he claims to have. It’s understood that the accused used to visit the victim’s home and sneak into the children’s bedroom where he used to molest and rape the victim over a period of six years. The victim only came out about her abuse in 2017, she is now 20-years-old. The accused will return to court on the 13th of March where his trial is expected to get under way.
