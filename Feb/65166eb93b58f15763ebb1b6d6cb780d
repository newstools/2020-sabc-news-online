Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has accused the African National Congress (ANC) of delaying the process of expropriating land without compensation. Delivering the State of the Nation Address, on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the government stands ready to table an Expropriation Bill that outlines the circumstances under which expropriation of land without compensation would be permissible. Ramaphosa said the government had released 44 000 hectares of state land for the settlement of land restitution claims, and will in 2020 release round 700 000 hectares of state land for agricultural production. “President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC have delayed the process of restoring the dignity of our people, only to propose legislation that does not fundamentally change Section 25. ” “Land expropriation without compensation will only be done under certain circumstance while the principle of the property clause remains intact. This goes directly against the spirit of the submission of our people at the public hearings and it means our people will remain landless because the government of the day wants to compensate those who inherited our stolen land.” “What is the point of having these public hearings if our people have given us direction but the government deliberately ignores them.”
