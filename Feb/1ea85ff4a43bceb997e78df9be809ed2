The community of Elsies River on the Cape Flats has called on authorities to reconsider granting parole to inmates serving sentences for serious crimes and with track records of being outlaws. An anti-crime summit was held at the local high school on Saturday to discuss crime-fighting strategies. It was held only a day after the court appearance of the alleged killer of eight-year old Tazne van Wyk of Elsies River whose body was found in a storm water drain in Worcester earlier this week. In the video below a crowd gathers outside for suspect Moyhdian Pangaker’s court appearance:  The suspect, Moyhdian Pangaker, was out on parole after being jailed for culpable homicide. According to the crime statistics, 90 murders were reported in 2019 at the Elsies River Police Station – a large increase compared to previous years. One of the organisers of the summit, Imraahn Mukaddam, says they want everyone involved to solve the scourge of crime. “Crime is ravaging our community. We can’t seem to get to grips with it and we realise that the only way that we can actually go forward is with a well-thought community-based plan. So, the purpose of the summit is to get all the stakeholders together to get them to deliberate about the cause of that crime and then together come up with solutions as well as plans to be implemented in the community collectively.”
