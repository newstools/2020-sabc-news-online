Political parties must on Friday submit names of persons to serve on the independent panel that will kick off the process that could see the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, removed from office.  Newly adopted rules for the removal of heads of Chapter Nine institutions require that an independent panel must be established, after which an ad hoc committee will make its findings. Mkhwebane has applied for an urgent interdict to challenge these rules. “In court papers, the Public Protector wants Parliament to halt the process, to provide reasons why the motion to start this process was agreed to and for all conflicted persons to declare their interest. She wants the rules declared unlawful, unconstitutional, invalid, null and void or alternatively that the rules are not implemented retrospectively. National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, says Parliament is enabled by the constitution to make its own processes, to determine its rules, to do the internal processes. Once established, the independent panel will have 30 days to complete its work.” Click on the video below:
