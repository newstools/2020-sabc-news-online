The University of the Western Cape (UWC) says some lectures were disrupted on Monday morning by students demanding the scrapping of historical debt. UWC Spokesperson, Garant Abarder, says the academic year has officially kicked off with many classes continuing as normal. He says they’re monitoring the situation. “We are aware that some of the lectures have been disrupted this morning by a small group of students. They are singing and picketing. The university’s management is calling for calm and engaging with these students. In the meantime though, classes will continue. This is a very large campus with lots of faculties and classes begin today. Today is the start of the academic year,” says Abarder. Last week, North West University including the Universities of the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal were closed following a call by the South African Union of Students (SAUS) to shut down public universities. Students demanded, among others the eradication of historical debt, free registration for the poor and the revision of guidelines for accreditation of student accommodation.
