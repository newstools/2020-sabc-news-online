The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) is caught in an ugly legal battle after axing its spokesperson who is facing three counts of rape. The federation alleges that it was not aware that Douglas Mthukwane stands accused of rape when they employed him as their spokesperson 2019. Mthukwane has since taken the federation to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), for unfair labour practices. Saftu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says the axing of the former spokesperson was in the best interest of the federation. “We took a risk to offer him employment without his fingerprints being taken. In a letter of his appointment, we told him that should we find something in his criminal record we will withdraw the offer to employ. We cannot be associated in any way with someone facing a plethora of serious allegations. Saftu has a very strong stance against women and children abuse,” explains Vavi.
