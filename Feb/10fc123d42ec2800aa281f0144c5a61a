A police officer has been arrested in connection with the murder of six family members who were brutally attacked at their home in Mpumalanga Township, west of Durban in December last year. The 51-year-old warrant officer was arrested in Johannesburg on Sunday. He will appear in a Durban court on Monday.  The officer is the second suspect to be arrested in connection to the murders. The first suspect, 29-year-old Buhlebakhe Khomo, was arrested last month. Three people survived the attack – including a three-year-old boy. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker says the officer is facing charges of murder and attempted murder. “KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner has hailed the latest arrest of the suspect wanted for the brutal killing of a family in Mpumalanga on the 11th of December last year (2019). The officer is expected to appear on Monday in the Mpumalanga court facing murder and attempted murder charges. More arrests are expected as the investigation progresses.”
