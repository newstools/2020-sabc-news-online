The MMC for Public Safety in Gauteng, Mally Mokoena will be visiting the family of an eight-year-old boy who drowned during Saturday’s flooding in Johannesburg and surrounding areas. His body was found in the Mlhangeni informal settlement in Roodepoort after his family reported him missing on Saturday.  Emergency Services Spokesperson, Nana Radebe says the body of the boy was found on Saturday. “The search and rescue for the eight-year-old continued and the body of the eight-year-old was later found. We are going to be visiting the family together with the MMC for Public Safety on Sunday morning.” Meanwhile, the South African Weather Services says although it has predicted a 60% chance of thundershowers in Gauteng for Sunday, there aren’t any flood warnings.  Heavy downpours in Johannesburg since Friday night caused flash flooding in various parts in and around the city. Residents of various informal settlements lost everything after rivers and streams burst their banks while houses in Riverlea in the south of Johannesburg were also underwater. Patients in the Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa Hospitals had to be moved after wards were flooded.   The weather service says it is monitoring the situation. Forecaster Edward Engelbrecht says no alerts of thunderstorms were sent out on Sunday. “We do expect a 60% chance of thunderstorms over Gauteng. It’s going to be mostly from late evening and in light of the flash flooding that we had yesterday (Saturday), we do not have any alerts out today (Sunday) with regards to these thunderstorms so we’re not expecting any flash flooding but we are monitoring the situation. So during the day, we will issue anything if it is necessary.” Click on the video below:
