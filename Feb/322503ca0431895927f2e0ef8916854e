A whistle blower within the office of the Public Protector says he fears for his job after approaching parliament. Sphelo Samuel who is the Public Protector’s representative in the Free State says many people inside Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s office are concerned about the way she conducts herself. He has written a letter to the Speaker of Parliament, Thandi Modise asking her to investigate Mkhwebane and her office. “My fear is that I’m going to be fired, but I’m not going to take it lying down some things were said and done today following the reports over the weekend that indicate that they are after me.” “They want to charge me for speaking to the media and its perfectly my right as to who I speak to, I’m not speaking on behalf of the office, I’m speaking against her and her practices.”
