Additional security will be deployed to the High Court in Pretoria when the case of former SAA chairperson, Dudu Myeni resumes on Monday. This follows Friday’s incident in which supporters of Myeni allegedly assaulted a member of the Organisation of Undoing Tax Abuse OUTA’s legal team and verbally threatened the organisation’s advocate, Carol Steinberg. OUTA has accused Myeni of collapsing the airline by refusing among others, to sign the memorandum of understanding which would have yielded over R1-billion profit guarantee for SAA. Former SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni says former President Jacob Zuma had no role in her appointment at the airline.  OUTA and the SAA Pilots’ Organisation have taken Myeni to court to have her declared as a delinquent director after the national carrier was plunged into financial chaos during her six-year tenure as board chair. Myeni testifies in the Pretoria High Court in the matter brought by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and the SAA Pilots Association to declare her a delinquent director.  Steinberg told the court that she felt threatened and was scared of being in an environment that was not conducive for her to continue with her work.
