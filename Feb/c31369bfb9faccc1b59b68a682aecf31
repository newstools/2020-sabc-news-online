The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has dismissed reports by some “so-called” health experts, urging the public to get flu vaccinations as a precautionary measure to prevent contracting the coronavirus. The NICD says these claims are fake as there is currently no known way to prevent contracting the virus. They have assured South Africans that there is no case of the virus in the country. The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak that has killed more than 360 people in China and infected more than 17 000, a global public health emergency.  The NICD’s Cheryl Cohen says, “Reliable credible information on coronavirus can be obtained from the World Health Organisation website and social media pages, the NICD website or social media pages and the department of health website and social media pages. We continue to receive a high number of calls to the designated hospitals or the 24 hour hotline. There is no case of 2019 novel coroanvirus in South Africa. The emergency operations centre remains activated.” Meanwhile, the Ambassador of China to South Africa, His Excellency Lin Songtian will host a media briefing in Pretoria on Monday morning, to update the South African communities on the latest situation regarding the outbreak and particularly how the People’s Republic of China has responded to fight the virus.
