Chinese state television has reported a leap in the number of deaths in China’s central Hubei province, by 64 to 414. A further 2,345 cases have been detected there, raising the number of total cases to 13,522 since the coronavirus outbreak. Hubei’s provincial capital of Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated, reported 48 new deaths on Monday, accounting for most of the new casualties. A total of 313 people in Wuhan have now died from the virus. New confirmed cases in Wuhan surged by 1,242 on Monday. With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lock down, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing.
