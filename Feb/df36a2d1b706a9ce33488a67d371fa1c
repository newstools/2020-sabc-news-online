The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has vowed to disrupt 2020’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) in the National Assembly chamber. The party says it will make sure that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is shown the door and he vacates his position in government.  EFF leader Julius Malema says as soon as President Cyril Ramaphosa takes to the podium to deliver the address on Thursday they’ll start to demand that Gordhan be removed from the chamber. Malema addressed the media in Centurion, south of Pretoria. “We are going to demand that Pravin must go and we are going to demand that in Parliament, and we are going to have mass actions on Pravin starting 13 February in parliament. When Cyril starts, we start. That’s how it’s going to roll. When he starts speaking we also start about Pravin going. We are not going to be held here by Pravin. It must come to an end,” says Malema.  “We also call on de Klerk to stay away from the SONA and return Nobel Peace Prize he got. He’s has proven to be an Apartheid apologist. We will not (share) a democratic parliament with him, who says Apartheid is not a crime against humanity.” Last week, National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise said no disruptions would be allowed when President Ramaphosa delivers the SONA.
