The Federal Legal Commission of the Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to George Mayor, Melvin Naik, informing him that his membership has been cancelled. The DA’s constituency head for George, Geordin Hill-Lewis, says Naik is no longer a member of the party. He was given 48 hours to resign as Mayor but he refused to do. The party’s action comes after the DA caucus in George passed a motion of no confidence in Naik in January. This after a forensic investigation found evidence of Naik’s involvement in fraud, corruption, maladministration and serious malpractice within municipality. Hill-Lewis says the DA believes that it is in the best interest of the municipality and the people of George that Naik vacates the mayoral position.
