Eskom has announced an immediate stage 2 load shedding that it says will run until Sunday, 16 February 2020.  The cash strapped power utility, which suffered almost a decade of maladministration and corruption, implemented stage 2 load shedding on Friday evening. Eskom Spokesperson Sikhonathi Matshantsha says some of its generators went down and left the grid constrained. “We have unfortunately lost four generating units this evening. And that means we have no choice but to implement load shedding. We regret this inconvenience. Our unplanned outages have now increased to 11 427 megawatts at 8. We will again update the market in the morning as to how the day will look like,” says Matshantsha.    [WATCH]Reaction to government’s plan for Eskom: Chris Yelland
