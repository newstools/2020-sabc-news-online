The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says the national Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) should investigate a breakdown of governance in the George Municipality. On Wednesday, the Democratic Alliance (DA)’s Federal Executive suspended Mayor Melvin Naik from all party activities following a vote of no confidence passed against him by the DA caucus in the municipality. It’s alleged that Naik received kickbacks worth R600 000 for a waste management contract. Naik has maintained his innocence. The ANC’s local government spokesperson MEC in the provincial legislature Danville Smith says Local Government MEC Anton Bredell is selective in the way it deals with what is happening in the George municipality. “Recently they decided to go for the mayor of George, but we saying at the ANC there is a Special Investigating Unit (SIU) investigation that shows that senior management is implicated in the allegations of corruption.  Our view is that there is substantial proof of wrong doing in George, let’s get Cogta on board,” explains Smith.
