African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa says his party will take strict and more decisive action against dysfunctional municipalities. He was addressing the North West leg of the ANC January 8 celebrations in Schweizer Reneke in North West. The Schweizer Reneke based Mamusa Local Municipality was dissolved last year for service delivery failure and financial mismanagement. ANC president Ramaphosa says all dysfunctional municipalities will be dissolved. “We are no longer going to tolerate dysfunctional municipalities. We are no longer going to live with municipalities that do not do the work they were elected to do. Once we have such municipalities we will remove you.” WATCH BELOW:
