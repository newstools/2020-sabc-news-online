Members of political parties in the North West Provincial Legislature will on Tuesday morning debate the State of the Province Address (SOPA) that was delivered by Premier Job Mokgoro last week Friday. Chaos erupted in the legislature during Mokgoro’s address and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Democratic Alliance (DA) members walked out. The argument by opposition parties on the legitimacy of premier Mokgoro’s government is expected to be a talking point during the debate. The opposition argues that since the national government has placed the province under administration, Mokgoro has been stripped off his executive powers. Another matter will be the assault of EFF members by the provincial legislature’s security personnel. Premier Mokgoro is expected to respond to the debate on Thursday this week.
