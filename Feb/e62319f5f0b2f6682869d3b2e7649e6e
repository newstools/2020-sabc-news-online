Some economists say President Cyril Ramaphosa should address the implementation of economic structural reforms and measures to deal with government debt. Ramaphosa will deliver the State-of-the-Nation Address (SONA) at 7PM. With the country’s economy growing below 1%, Ramaphosa is expected to address the high unemployment rate and crises at state-owned enterprises. Statistics South Africa on Tuesday released its Labour Force Survey which revealed that the unemployment rate remains at 29.1%.

Chief Economist at the Centre for Risk Analysis Ian Cruickshanks says Ramaphosa must give action plans. “He has to say that these are his plans for growing the economy, getting it at a higher tempo and then by that way manufacturing the possibilities of new jobs.  Job creation; he must show us the plans that they have. They keep talking about it, but nothing ever happens. All we see is even higher unemployment. So, clearly the strategy of the recent past has not been working.” In the video below Econometrix Chief Economist Dr Azar Jammine talks about the issues facing SA economy:  Watch the SONA coverage on the video below:
