Members of the Assembly of the Unemployed have arrived in Cape Town ahead of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Budget Speech on Wednesday. The activists, who left Mpumalanga on Friday, say they will attend the Real Job Summit on Monday and on Tuesday before holding a mass protest in front of Parliament on budget day. They are demanding jobs and improved basic services from government. The group’s Spokesperson Khokhomo Motsi says unemployment is really bad in South Africa. “Our issues are unemployment, which is really a bad situation in our country where we have 11 million people unemployed according to the organic statistics that we have, which is atomic bomb because immediately when it explodes, it will explode in the face of the rich.”
