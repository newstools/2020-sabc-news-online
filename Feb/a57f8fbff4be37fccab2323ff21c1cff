The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has warned Parliament’s Presiding officers that bringing members of the Police Service (SAPS) in as protection officers during Thursday’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) is against parliamentary rules. In a statement, the party claims to have been informed that Parliament’s Head of Security, Deon Van der Spuy is holding secret meetings to co-ordinate a plan to smuggle SAPS members into Parliament disguised as Protection Officers to remove EFF members. The party has threatened to disrupt SONA if Pravin Gordhan is not fired as Public Enterprises Minister by then. EFF members first disrupted the SONA in 2015 when they prevented former President Jacob Zuma to speak, chanting their “Payback the money” slogan. EFF plans to disrupt SONA:  The party says that Parliament’s move to conspire with SAPS is unlawful and borders on constitutional delinquency by the Presiding officers. It reiterated that the EFF will not allow the SONA to continue as long as Gordhan remains Minister.
