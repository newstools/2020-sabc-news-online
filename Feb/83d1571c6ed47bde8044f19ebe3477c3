The Department of Communication says it is in talks with the Competition Commission and the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa on data prices. South Africans had recently taken to social media about their concerns regarding high data prices. Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says they are also engaging with the country’s mobile operators. Ndabeni-Abrahams says they strongly believe the engagements will bring a solution. ” We have asked ICASA to engage with competition commission because it’s important that we collaborate [so] that our people on the ground can get to realise the spin-offs of the work that we are doing. We are convinced that engagement advances and we are hopeful that a solution will be reached soon.”” says Ndabeni-Abrahams. Major mobile operators Vodacom and MTN have two months to reduce their data prices by up to 50% or face prosecution.  Meanwhile, Ndabeni-Abrahams say the introduction of digital resources at schools should not have to wait for the installation of expensive infrastructure. Modern wireless systems make the introduction of digital libraries much cheaper and faster. Ndabeni visited the rural area of Ndwedwe in northern KwaZulu-Natal where she unveiled a digital library learning centre with over 20 computers. “If it means that let’s introduce digital learning whereby we provide tablets to those who don’t have access to physical infrastructure in terms of the buildings we will have to do so. If people believe that for students to get education they must go to class rooms I don’t believe that. I have seen it in other countries where children and other adults are able to access education with just their tablets. This does not mean that I don’t want buildings, I want buildings but where government has not managed to put infrastructure I still say every child has a right to education. If it means it’s through a cell phone or through a tablet let it be so,” says Ndabeni-Abrahams.
