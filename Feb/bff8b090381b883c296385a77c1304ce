Embattled outgoing Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has accused opposition parties in the metro of deliberately disrupting his administration from providing adequate service delivery to residents. Mokgalapa announced his intention to resign from his position at the end of February earlier on Sunday. He maintains that he did nothing wrong and says it was best for the city if he stands down as mayor. He is expected back at work on Monday after being on special leave. Mokgalapa says the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have launched a concerted effort to oust his administration in order to gain access to the city’s coffers. “It is in the best interest of ensuring that service delivery happens to the residents of Tshwane and just get rid of self-interest, it’s just political self-interest of political parties who just want to circumvent democracy.” “A takeover of the city for access to the city coffers in a sustained action ensuring that my administration is always disturbed in as far as delivery of the services is concerned, we see a concerted effort by both the ANC and the EFF.” Click video below:
