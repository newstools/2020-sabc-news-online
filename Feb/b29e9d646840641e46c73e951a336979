KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the province will seek to hold an urgent meeting with national government to discuss the decision of South African Airways (SAA) to cancel most domestic as well as some international routes. The airline announced on Thursday that it had taken the decision together with the Business Rescue Practitioners in an effort to make SAA financially sustainable. It also announced the possible retrenchment of workers on the affected routes. Zikalala says SAA’s decision will negatively affect KwaZulu-Natal’s economy. “The decision is wrong because it will affect the economy. There is no evidence to prove that the route is not sustainable. If you say the route is not sustainable, why British Airways which are the same level as SAA would be able to manage the route and increase the volume? We will be taking up the matter with national government as well as with the board.”
