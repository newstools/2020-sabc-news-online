Eskom has defended its decision to give voluntary packages to its senior staff. The packages, which will be implemented during March and April this year, will exclude workers at lower, non-managerial levels. The power utility says it will ensure that no critical skills are lost during the process. The process will see cash-strapped Eskom using R400 million which it says will be recouped. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha has denied reports that the packages are a form of forced retrenchments. He says the purpose of the process is to ensure a more efficiently run business. “There will be no forced job losses and general workers or non-managerial workers will not at all be affected. The aim is to reduce headcount costs and indeed to rationalise senior management. The cost of this R400-million will be recouped within the first year and this should result in an efficiently run company.” Read Eskom’s statement in the tweet below:
