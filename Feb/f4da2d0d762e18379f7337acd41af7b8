Tuesday 11 February marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. Madiba spent the last 14 months of his 27-year jail term in the then Victor Verster Prison in Paarl. Madiba walked out of the prison gates at the age of 71 amid huge excitement. He later addressed thousands at the Grand Parade in the Cape Town CBD. Madiba attributed his release to the struggle of the people of the country. “Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today, I, therefore, place the remaining years of my life in your hands.” President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver a speech from the balcony of the Cape Town City Hall on Tuesday, where former statesman Nelson Mandela delivered his address after his release from prison on 11 February 1990. Ramaphosa’s speech forms part of a series of events taking place around the Western Cape to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the former president’s release from the Victor Verster prison in Paarl, which is now known as the Drakenstein Correctional Centre. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and his wife Leah have paid tribute to former president Nelson Mandela. The Tutus praised the former statesman for his warmth and human values. In a statement, they said while circumstances and priorities change over time, good values are timeless. They say Mandela dazzled the world with his warmth and that they miss him.
