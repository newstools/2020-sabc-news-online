African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has encouraged party members to support former President Jacob Zuma, who faces trial in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on corruption charges linked to the arms deal. Magashule was speaking at the Saul Tsotetsi Community Hall in Sebokeng, in the Vaal, where the party’s launch of the new online membership system took place. Last week, Zuma arrived back from overseas after apparently receiving medical treatment. Early this month a stayed warrant of arrest was issued by the Pietermaritzburg High Court after Zuma missed his appearance in relation to the arms deal case. Magashule says Zuma belongs to the ANC.

Zuma had reiterated that he would not lie about being ill if he was not ill. Speaking to supporters who welcomed him back at the OR Tambo International, after his return from Cuba where he received medical treatment, Zuma said he was prepared to go to jail if he was convicted of a crime. “I am not scared of prison. When I am wanted in court I go. Even during the the time the white people were in charge, I went. They imprisoned me for 10 years and I came out. Even now, if this government of ours can arrest me and find me guilty, I will go to prison,” says Zuma. Supporters of former President Jacob Zuma have criticised the issuing of a stayed warrant for his arrest should he fail to pitch for his next court appearance on May 6.
