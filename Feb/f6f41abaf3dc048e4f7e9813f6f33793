More former security branch police officers are expected to testify this week when the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid activist Neil Aggett resumes in the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday morning. Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the John Vorster Square Police Station on February 5 1982. Aggett’s family has rejected the security branch police claims that he committed suicide. Last week, former security branch officer Nicolaas Deetlefs, who was initially scheduled to testify for two days, ended up spending four days on the witness stand as the state and the Aggett family lawyers battled to get the information they wanted from him. Human Rights Lawyer Yasmine Sooka says: “The state should prosecute Nicolaas Deetlefs because he had another opportunity to really take the court into his confidence and tell the truth about the fact that he was involved, not only in the torture and the assault of other activists, but he was also implicated in the torture of Dr Aggett, something that he’s refused to admit to, and also for his role in the cover-up of the murder of Dr Neil Aggett.” In the video, former security branch police officer Nicolaas Deetlefs continues to face cross-examination
