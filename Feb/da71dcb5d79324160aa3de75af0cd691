The multi-million rand bulk water supply project from Nandoni to Giyani in Limpopo has stalled again. Sub-contractors have abandoned site and the contractor has issued Lepelle Northern Water with a notice to vacate site due to non-payment. Lepelle CEO Phineas Legodi says they have forwarded Vharanani’s concerns to the Department of Water Affairs, which has committed to making the payment. More than R3 billion has thus far been spent on this project and Lepelle CEO says efforts to resolve the impasse are currently underway. Legodi says, “We have received a notice of intention by Vharanani to withdraw from the project due to non-payment. There has been delays in terms of payments, the minister and her team of senior managers were locked up in the meeting where a range of resolutions were taken. Among those include immediate payment that is due to the service provider so the money may be coming in any time soon.” Water Affairs spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says Vharananani’s notice is receiving attention. In the video it is reported that more than 50 villages around Giyani are still without clean drinking water  Last year the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) raided the offices of the Lepelle Northern Water Board in Polokwane following allegations of corruption in the awarding of a tender. The unit searched for documents related to the multi-billion-rand Water Scheme which had failed to supply water to about 50 villages around Giyani. The water project has been riddled with allegations of corruption and has been inflated to over R2 billion.
