President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s lawyers say the review matter before the High Court in Pretoria, between him and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane should not be seen as a case of liability but of ethics. Ramaphosa is asking the court to review and set aside Mkhwebane’s report on the CR17 election campaign funding debacle. His legal team argues that funding for political parties cannot be opened to the Public Protector’s jurisdiction. In the report, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament by failing to disclose a R500 000 donation by Bosasa. Advocate Vincent Maleka is arguing on behalf of the Economic Freedom Fighters at the High Court in Pretoria.  The review matter on the CR17 controversy by might end up in the Constitutional Court, legal representative of Amabhungane Steven Budlender has told the High Court in Pretoria. Budlender says there is consistent confusion over the Parliamentary Code and the Executives Ethics Code when it comes to political parties and individuals’ disclosure of funding. He says this subsequently renders the act governing it unconstitutional. Watch the video below for more on the story:
