Sentencing proceedings in the case of former crime intelligence boss, Richard Mdluli and his co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi, is expected to get underway on Monday at the High Court in Johannesburg. In July last year, Mdluli and Mthunzi were found guilty of intimidation, kidnapping and common assault. The case relates to the 1999 murder of Oupa Ramogibe, who allegedly had an affair with Mdluliâ€™s customary wife Tshidi Buthelezi. In November last year, Mdluli was acquitted on four counts of intimidation after a Constitutional Court ruling that certain sections of the Intimidation Act were unconstitutional.
