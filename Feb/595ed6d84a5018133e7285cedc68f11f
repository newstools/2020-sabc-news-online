The African Farmers Association of South Africa (AFASA) has expressed concern about the ongoing attacks on farmers in the country. It was reacting after this weekend’s attack on well-known Free State farmer, Mimi Jacobs. Jacobs was crowned Free State female farmer of the year in 2016.  She was attacked and stabbed when three armed men broke into her home on Saturday night. In the video below Free State police say the increase in farm murders and stock theft in the province is alarming.  She is recovering in a Bloemfontein hospital. AFASA secretary-general Nakana Masoka says they are concerned because these attacks are against a women. “We are extremely concerned about the attack on Mrs Jacobs on her farm. We have sent one of our district leaders in Mangaung to check on the situation and how she is recuperating and also to establish how far the police are with the investigations. We are more concerned because these attacks are against a woman, the lady who in the last few years was the winner of the Free State Female Farmer of the Year and currently also the chairperson of the province of the business organisations.” In the video below farmers and ordinary South Africans across the country rally together and wear black to unite against the ever-rising figures of farm attacks and murders in the country.
