Leticia Jansen‘s funeral service is underway at Khuthala Hostel Hall, in Germiston, East Rand. Jansen went missing on Wednesday last week before her body was found two days later in an open veld near the N17 East of Johannesburg. The 14-year-old had been stabbed, raped and burnt.  Jansen was brutally attacked while walking to school, after missing the scholar transport. It’s alleged that the pick-up and drop off times of the school transport were changed without informing parents.   The Gauteng Department of Education has suspended the school principal pending an investigation. They have also terminated the contract of the transport provider. Jansen’s funeral service is being held at the Khuthalo hostel hall in Dukathole in Germiston East of Johannesburg. Fellow school mates of Jansen say  more needs to be done to end violence against women and children. They were speaking on Friday at Jansen’s memorial service at their school  – Graceland Education Centre – in Elsburg, east of Johannesburg. Click on the video below:
