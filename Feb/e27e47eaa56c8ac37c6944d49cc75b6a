The Grade 8 learner died after a makeshift raft he and his fellow learners built capsized in the Crocodile River at the Nyathi Bush and River Break Lodge in the North West over a month ago. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi received the report over the weekend and said it showed wrongdoing on the part of those who were meant to take care of the children.
