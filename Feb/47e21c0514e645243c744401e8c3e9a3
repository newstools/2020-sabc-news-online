Prominent lawyer and social activist, advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, has supported the call from the Council of Churches, South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA), that former deputy president FW De Klerk and his Foundation apologise for their apparent defences of apartheid. He says from a legal perspective, apartheid is indeed classified as a crime against humanity. During an interview last week, De Klerk said he did not fully agree with the United Nations’s declaration of apartheid as a crime against humanity. Ngcukaitobi says De Klerk seems to be in denial. “The SACCA is correct in asking them not only to retract but also to apologise. The De Klerk foundation on its own numbers accepts that more than 3000 people were killed by security forces. What they seem to be disputing is that the numbers were too low to qualify as a crime against humanity.” “Legally speaking, apartheid as a crime against humanity is well settled there is not even a debate. What remains is a group of people that are hiding their hands under the sand and denying what everybody knows.” The SACP has also joined the Council of Churches and others in strongly condemning the apparent defence of apartheid by De Klerk. [MUST WATCH]: This is why the EFF in Parliament demanded that De Klerk be removed from the house. #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/vt71kw5jqq — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 13, 2020  UN confirms Apartheid was a crime against humanity, Click video below:
