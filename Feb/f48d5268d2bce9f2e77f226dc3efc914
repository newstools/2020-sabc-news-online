Eskom says it’s encouraged that its application – to implement electricity tariff hikes – was dismissed on urgency and not merit. The High Court in Pretoria on Monday dismissed Eskom‘s urgent application to implement electricity tariff hikes of 16.6% and 16.7% over the next two years. Geologist and Energy Expert Clyde Mallinson unpacks the judgment further:  NERSA had granted Eskom increases of 8.1% and 5.2%. The tariffs stand-off between Eskom and NERSA played out in the Pretoria High Court:  Eskom had sought interim relief saying a lower increase would threaten its financial sustainability. Judge Jody Kollapen dismissed the request as not urgent – saying the merits of the case would be heard in the review process.  Eskom Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha, says the power utility is prepared to argue their case. “Eskom acknowledges the court’s decision and of course we will abide by it. That means now the case will be heard as part of a normal court process and we are ready to present our case before the judge and we are encouraged by the fact that the judge has noted that NERSA’s decision of treating the equity injection as income on the income statement rather than an injection into the balance sheet. So there is merit in that argument and we are encouraged by the merits of the case which have not yet been argued.”
