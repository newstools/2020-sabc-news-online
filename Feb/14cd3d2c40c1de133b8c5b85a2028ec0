Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has noted reports that civil society organisation Unite Behind’s  court challenge of the appointment of the Prasa Administrator. #UniteBehind has filed court papers to the Western Cape High Court, aiming to overturn a decision by Mbalula to appoint Bongisizwe Mpondo as the Administrator of the Passenger Rail Association of South Africa (Prasa). The group wants the decision to be declared unlawful, reviewed and set aside. National Treasury, Prasa, Mpondo and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni are all cited as respondents. The application also seeks to have a permanent Prasa board appointed within a period of three months. In a statement, Mbalula says he is confident that decisions taken to address challenges at Prasa will withstand legal scrutiny.
