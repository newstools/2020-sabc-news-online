 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has reacted to the warrant of arrest issued for leader Julius Malema, saying there’s nothing concerning about the East London Magistrate Court’s decision. The court issued a warrant of arrest against Malema, stayed until 8 May, for failing to appear before it. EFF spokesperson Vuyani Pambo says their lawyers, the prosecutor and the Magistrate reached an agreement. “Our lawyers together with the prosecutor agreed with the Magistrate that there’ll be a withheld warrant of arrest; which simply means that the accused doesn’t have to appear until trial, so essentially that is the agreement. And then as it appears, he’ll go only when the trial starts. So it’s actually in the interest of South Africans for him not to appear all the time because there has to be extra security and the court has to prepare in such a way that it’s only his case that appears because a lot of people come into court.”   Malema and co-accused Adrian Snyman were due to appear on five counts of discharging a firearm in public. Malema allegedly discharged a rifle during the EFF’s fifth-anniversary celebrations at the Sisa Dukashe stadium in Mdantsane in 2018.
