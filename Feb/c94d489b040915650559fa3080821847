The EFF has denied allegations of tensions in the party amid reports that Gauteng party chairperson, Mandisa Mashego, has resigned. Reports say the EFF member has hanged her red beret after a fallout with party leader, Julius Malema. The reports say Mashego stopped being in the EFF Gauteng caucus in the provincial legislature and member of the house almost a week ago. They say she has handed a resignation letter to Malema and EFF secretary-general, Marshall Dlamini. EFF national spokesperson Vuyani Pambo says the reports are not accurate. “There’s never been a fallout. We’ve enjoyed a good relationship with her. She’s been a member of the EFF. She has not indicated anything. There’s not been a fallout with anyone in the organisation.”
