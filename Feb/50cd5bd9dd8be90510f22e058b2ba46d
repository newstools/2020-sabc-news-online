The Polokwane Municipality in Limpopo will implement water shedding in the city and its surrounding areas with immediate effect to ease water shortages. Municipal manager, Makgape Makobe says this is due to restrictions imposed by the Water and Sanitation Department on the amount of water that can be used from the Ebenezer Dam in Tzaneen. He says: “The context for putting water restrictions is due to the fact that the Department of Water Affairs has issued a restriction on water.” “We are unable to provide water for our residents for 24 hours a day, we are in a crisis as far as water is concerned.” “The Ebenerzer Dam is contributing to the lack of water in the City of Polokwane.”
