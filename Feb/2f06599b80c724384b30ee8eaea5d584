The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says it will head to court on Thursday as it wants proper processes to be followed at South African Airways (SAA). Numsa and the South Africa Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) have filed papers in the Labour Court for an urgent application to interdict the Business Rescue Practitioners at SAA from taking any steps towards the termination of jobs at the airline. The unions also want the Business Rescue Practitioners to comply with the terms of the wage agreement signed last year; compelling the employer to re-train workers facing retrenchments. Numsa National Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says: “We’re doing this because in the meeting that we had with them last week when they dropped the bombshell about the cancellation of 11 routes. They made it clear that they wanted to embark on massive retrenchments and that these retrenchments must happen as quickly as possible. So we have gone to court in order to protect the rights of our members and ensure that proper processes are followed.” Cancellation of domestic routes SAA last week announced several measures it will implement in its restructuring plans, including scrapping some domestic and international routes. The Johannesburg High Court also ordered SA Express to be placed under business rescue. While the Business Rescue Practitioners have stated that efforts are being taken to limit the impact of job losses, Hlubi-Majola said the cancellation of domestic routes would have a devastating impact on the workforce.
