The High Court in Lesotho has granted the victim’s application to oppose First Lady Maesaiah Thabane‘s bail. Thabane , who faces a murder charge for allegedly masterminding the assassination of her predecessor, Lipolelo Thabane was granted bail last week. In the video below the court grants First Lady Maesaiah Thabane bail:  She is charged with the attempted murder of Thato Sibolla, who was in the car with Lipolelo during the shooting. Thato Sibolla, together with three others including Tom Thabane, the grandson to the Prime Minister with the same name, made the appeal application. In the video below Sibolla says she was devastated by  court’s decision to grant the First Lady bail:  The state has supported the application saying they believe the First Lady is capable of interfering with the case. “So long as she’s out and she has access to money and influence, she’s likely to do worse,” said Sibolla’s lawyer Kuili Ndebele. The court has not decided on when the appeal will be heard, but it is expected in the next seven days. Meanwhile, Sibolla is in hiding in South Africa as she fears for her life while Thabane is out on bail.
