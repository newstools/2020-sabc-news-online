A 14-year-old learner has been stabbed to death at Freedom Park Secondary School in Soweto. The Department of Education says he was killed on Thursday allegedly by another learner who is now on the run.  The department’s spokesperson, Steve Mabona, says the two were both Grade 10 learners. “We are informed that the perpetrator is on the run, police are investigating circumstances surrounding this incident. We strongly condemn any act of learner misconduct and we appeal to parents to assist to enforce discipline in and around our space that’s what MEC Lesufi has said,” says Mabona.
