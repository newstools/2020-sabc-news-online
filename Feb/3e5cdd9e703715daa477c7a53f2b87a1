Thato Sibolla, the woman wounded during the assassination of Prime Minister Tom Thabane‘s estranged wife Lipolelo Thabane is appealing to Southern African Development Community facilitator and African Union chairperson, President Cyril Ramaphosa, to help her to get in contact with the Lesotho facilitation team. She believes she can contribute to the normalisation of the Mountain Kingdom. Sibolla says the murder and attempted murder case in which current First Lady Maeisiah Thabane is charged is not being properly handled and could further jeopardise the country’s stability. Meanwhile, Defence Minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula has called on the Lesotho government to ensure that the witnesses involved in the murder case are protected. Mapisa Nqakula says the region cannot be tasked with something that must be provided by a sovereign government. “I think people tend to put everything to the region, if there are witnesses to this kind of case then the country must take responsibility in protecting those witnesses.  The government of Lesotho must take responsibility; it can’t be that for every little thing that you push to the region to take responsibility. The region is involved in big stuff; we have a mediator in the form of the president of the Republic of South Africa.”
