Lesotho’s first lady Maesaiah Thabane will appear in court on Wednesday on charges of murder and attempted murder related to the assassination of her husband’s first wife Dipolelo Thabane. The first lady spent the night behind bars after handing herself over to police earlier. She was earlier reported to be on the run when an arrest warrant was issued against her. The first wife was shot dead two days before the inauguration of Prime Minister Tom Thabane in 2017. The person who was with first wife during her assassination was wounded. Lesotho’s Deputy National Police Commissioner Paseka Mokete says he believes that they have a water-tight case against the first lady. Mokete says, “We still maintain that we’ve got a very strong case against perpetrators in this case and we believe that when evidence is presented before a court of law, all of those suspects are going to be convicted of the murder of Mme Dipolelo Thabane.” “The first lady Maesaiah Thabane is facing two charges, count one is murder of Mme Dipolelo and count two is attempted murder of another person who was with Mme Dipolelo at the time of her murder. We’ve got a very strong case against her. She’s going to appear before a court law to answer,” he adds. Click below to watch related video:
