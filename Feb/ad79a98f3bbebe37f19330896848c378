Several people have been injured after police fired rubber bullets on protesting Kagiso residents, west of Johannesburg. The situation remains tense and police are trying to re-open some of the blocked roads. Residents are accusing the Mogale City local municipality of corruption in the awarding of RDP houses. They also allege that companies from outside the municipality’s jurisdiction are awarded tenders whereas local businesses are being overlooked. Community leader, Sello Tshukudu, says they met with the police and some government officials on Friday morning to look into the community’s demands. “The station commander of Kagiso organised people from Mogale City because there’s no administration at Mogale City.  We had a meeting with them at the Police station. We came back to give the community feedback, but the community demands answers now. For us to disperse, the police started shooting without giving the guys the chance to disperse. Some people are hurt.” The municipality is yet to react to the allegations.
