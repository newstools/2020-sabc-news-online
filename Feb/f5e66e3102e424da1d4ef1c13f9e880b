International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor says that resolving the conflict in Libya will take priority at the African Union Heads of State Summit taking place this weekend in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Libya has been at war since 2011 when there was a revolt against the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi which lead to his ousting and death. Currently, the UN is brokering talks between warring parties. However, Pandor believes Africa must also play a role in line with the meeting’s broader theme of silencing the guns on the continent… “According to the reports we had you have interstate and intra-state conflict. There are about 70 now on the continent which is a massive reduction from 10-years-ago but still, these are still militating against what we would like to achieve. So, the Libyan focus is an important one and we will be through the heads of state received a report on the meeting held in Congo Brazzaville and we shall adopt further steps because we are determined that Africa should take a lead in the challenges confronting Libya today.” Click on the video below:
