The Congress of South African Students (COSAS) is embarking on a campaign called ‘Learn Without Fear’ that is aimed at eradicating inequality and bullying at the country’s schools. There have been numerous videos on social media depicting bullying incidents at schools, with the latest being  at the Roodepark High school in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. COSAS Secretary-General, Teboho Magafane, says parents need to become more proactive in school meetings and awareness campaigns to end the scourge of school bullying. “When we are saying ‘Learn without Fear’, as a child when you go to school you must not be intimidated you must go to school and learn. As a teacher you must go to school and teach but remember we can’t achieve that programme alone as the organisation. We need the assistance of our parents and our parents are ignorant. That’s why you find these things in our schools. Our parents are not attending parent meetings. What they know is to go and attend stokvel instead of them attending parents meetings. We urge our parents that they must attend parents meeting and they must play a vital role,” says Magafane. Meanwhile, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lusufi has expressed disappointment that his department was not informed of the bullying incident at Roodepark High School. The department says the incident happened on Wednesday but that it only heard about it on Saturday through the media. “According to the information at our disposal, this incident occurred after a 17 year old was allegedly slam-dunked by a 15-year-old and as a result that child got injured and was admitted in a hospital. We are also encouraged however that perpetrator has been temporarily suspended up until the disciplinary process would then be undertaken on 10 of February, 2020,” says Steve Mabona, Spokesperson.
