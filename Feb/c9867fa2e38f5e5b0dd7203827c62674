The North West Provincial Legislature says a report on the alleged assault of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members by the legislature’s security personnel, will be ready within the next seven days. The incident took place during the State of the Province Address (SOPA) last week Friday in Mahikeng. “We have started with the investigations. We are studying all the material at our disposal. We will interview those who had the direct relation to the event. We are already also talking to the political parties to give us their vision on the matter,” says Oageng Mosiane, North West Provincial Legislature Secretary. Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip in the Legislature, Freddy Sonakile, says he is of the view that the legislature speaker, Sussana Rebecca Dantjie, should also be investigated. “While we welcome the investigation proposal by the speaker, we believe that she must take that investigation further by ensuring that she brings an independent body that is going to conduct that investigation. She must subject herself as well to that investigation because we believe, as the DA, she is part of what happened. She is the cause of what happened in that house,” says Sonakile.
