Former president Jacob Zuma has arrived at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg from Cuba where he was receiving treatment for an undisclosed illness. He failed to appear in court earlier this month due to ill health but the Pietermaritzburg High Court disregarded his sick note and issued a stayed warrant for his arrest if he fails to pitch for his next court appearance on May 6. Earlier, the Mkhonto we Sizwe Military Veteran’s Association (MKMVA) president Kebby Maphatsoe said Zuma must not be indicted in the court of public opinion. Maphatsoe insists that Western conspiracy to destroy Zuma is continuing – citing the stayed warrant of arrest issued against him but was stayed to May 6, a fortnight ago after failing to appear in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on fraud and corruption charges dating from the early 1990s.
