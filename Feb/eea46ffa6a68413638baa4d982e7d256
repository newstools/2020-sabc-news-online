Eskom has lifted Stage 2 load shedding as emergency reserves have adequately recovered to allow for a reduction in the depth of load shedding. It says it will move to Stage 1 from Monday morning. The power utility, however, says the risk for load shedding for the week remains. Eskom will provide an update on Monday afternoon on the prognosis for the rest of the week. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says former Eskom acting Board Chairperson and CEO Jabu Mabuza and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan misled President Cyril Ramaphosa on load shedding. This after Ramaphosa assured South Africans that there would be no load shedding until January the 13th. Eskom introduced it again on January the 4th. Mabuza has since resigned from Eskom.
