Human Rights Watch in Southern Africa says the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has to act and stem militant attacks in Mozambique as they pose a threat to the whole region. Major oil companies have asked Mozambique to send in more troops to guard their operations in the far north of the country following attacks in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The province is home to one of the world’s biggest gas finds in the past decade. The area is also the centre of a local insurgency that killed hundreds of people since 2017. Dewa Mavhinga, the Human Rights Watch Southern Africa Director, says the attacks pose a threat to human rights in the region. “The Southern African Development Community needs not only to be worried, but it needs to take immediate steps and support the Mozambican authority to contain the situation. We have weak institutions that are supposed to protect and promote human rights. SADC stripped the SADC tribunal of its power to receive human rights complaints from SADC citizens and this should be restored.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
