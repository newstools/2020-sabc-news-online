The State Capture Commission will on Monday afternoon hear testimony from a witness only known as Mister X. The witness previously implicated former president Jacob Zuma and South African Airways (SAA) former board chair Dudu Myeni in his testimony. He will be testifying from an unidentified location after he was placed in witness protection over the weekend following alleged death threats. The commission’s investigating team confirmed that his evidence has credibility. The witness knows as Mr X says his daughter received a call on the 24 January from Dudu Myeni where she called him a sell-out. His company is alleged to have been used to facilitate funds for high profile individuals.  In a statement read by Advocate Kate Hofmeyr he says many people in the community depend on Myeni and is concerned that if his identity is revealed he might get retaliation due to selling out these important people.
