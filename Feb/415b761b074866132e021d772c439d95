Emergency medical services (EMS) in Johannesburg are still conducting search and rescue operations in flood-hit parts of the city after Saturday’s heavy downpours that left many areas under water. EMS teams are handing out food parcels and community development is providing shelter for those who have lost everything in the floods. Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) senior spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar, has advised motorists to be cautious on wet roads. He explains which roads should be avoided. “We’re likely to see some more flooding on roads around Jukskei River, Rabie Road in Randburg. Those are the roads that are likely to flood again should it rain. We encourage drivers not to drive through water, where there’s river water over a road, either turn around or take an alternative route,” says Minnaar. Residents of various informal settlements lost everything after rivers and streams burst their banks while houses in Riverlea in the south of Johannesburg were also under water. Patients in the Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa Hospitals had to be moved after wards were flooded.   Meanwhile, residents of Kliptown in Soweto have appealed to government to move them to a safe area. The residents that have been affected in Kliptown live near the banks of the Klip River. They could not access their homes due to excessive flooding: “We were woken up by water. I tried to save our belongings such as identity documents, it was too late. I had to save my child. Our furniture, clothes of our children have been damaged. What is happening in Kliptown is hurtful.”   Watch related videos below:
