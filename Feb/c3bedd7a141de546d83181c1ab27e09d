Eskom has served a notice to the cash-strapped Letsemeng Local Municipality in the Free State of its intention to cut electricity supply to the municipality from this week. The municipality incorporates towns such as Koffiefontein, Petrusburg and Luckhoff. Eskom says due to the municipality’s failure to pay its electricity bills, scheduled power outages will be implemented from Thursday from 6:00 to 20:00 daily. In a statement, Eskom said “Despite numerous demands, the municipality has failed to honour payment of its electricity accounts to Eskom. “Eskom recognises that indefinitely withholding electricity supply may cause undue hardship to consumers and members of the community, and may adversely affect the delivery of other services. “In view of this and in order to minimise any hardship to consumers and members of the community, Eskom will withhold its electricity supply services in a regulated pattern as opposed to an outright disconnection.” Read the full statement below:
