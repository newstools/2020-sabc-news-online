The African National Congress’ (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee in the Western Cape says it’s on track for its April conference. The NEC must still review its work to rebuild the party in the province and its preparations for 2021 local government elections. The NEC disbanded the party’s Western Cape leadership in 2019, due to poor performance. The interim structure was established in August 2019. The Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) says it has experienced a number of challenges in the past couple of months. IPC Chairperson Lurumo Kalako says:”What we found on the ground were non-functioning branches, which is a problem. Most of the branches became non-functional after elections and that is why the communities couldn’t feel their presence on the ground. The ANC is in a transition of old system of membership to a new system which is electronic, so all the regions and branches have been dealing with that, taking forms to national to be put into the system, that has not been easy.” Kalako says they have made a number of strides in reviving branches and regaining confidence in the party. However, the IPC has highlighted a number of concerns in the province. These include the on-going suspension of the MyCiTi N2 Express service which affects thousands of workers in Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha. It’s also expressed concern over the continued arson attacks on trains which have essentially crippled the rail service in the province. The party says plans to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of Nelson Mandela from prison on February 11 will be communicated in the coming days.
