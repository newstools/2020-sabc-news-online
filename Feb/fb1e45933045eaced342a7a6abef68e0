President Cyril Ramaphosa says for South Africa to prosper, the government must ensure that young people participate meaningfully in the economy. Ramaphosa was speaking in his weekly letter to the nation.

He said this prompted him to launch the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention which will set out priority actions to address youth unemployment.
