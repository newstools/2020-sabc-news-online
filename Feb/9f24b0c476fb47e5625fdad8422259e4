Eskom says Stage-1 load shedding will be halted Tuesday morning between 6am and 9am in order to ease congestion on the country’s roads as South Africans head to work. The power outages will then resume and be halted again in the afternoon between 4pm and 6pm. On Sunday the power utility downgraded load shedding from Stage-2 saying its emergency reserves have adequately recovered. However, Eskom says the risk of load shedding for the week remains. Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha, “There will be a break between six and nine. And then there will be another break from four to six in the afternoon. That will again make it a little easier to commute to work and home.”
