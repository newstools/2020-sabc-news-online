Former head of supply-chain at South African Airways Technical (SAAT) Nontsasa Memela has denied being responsible for the failures in her department. She has concluded her testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Wednesday. Memela told the Commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that she did not accept responsibility for the management of contracts. She instead shifted the blame to her subordinates and other SAAT board members. Memela faced four days of gruelling about bribery and corruption allegations. Her testimony also highlighted her alleged cosy relationship with JM Aviation director Vuyisile Ndzeku who won a R1.3 billion contract with SAAT in 2016. “It’s as if I was actually far more senior than the board. If I did know Chair, I would say then unknowing to myself I was a Minister just giving instructions and stuff. I reported to people, I was a HOD and I played my role to the best of my ability.” “But where I have to answer on behalf of the acting CEO it means I have that power to influence the acting CEO and the person who owned the GPU’s and the list goes on. So no, I did not have any influence,” Memela explains. Earlier, a visibly irritated State Capture Commission Chair told the witness’s legal representative that the line of questioning at the inquiry was legitimate.
