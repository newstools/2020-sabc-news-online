Eskom says it does not expect to implement load shedding Friday. The power utility has not implemented rolling power outages over the past two days due to a number of improvements on the power system. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says there is currently sufficient generating capacity to operate without implementing load shedding. “No load shedding is expected to be implemented. Breakdowns are just at over 10500 megawatts and we do have sufficient capacity to generate without implementing load shedding however we do urge customers to continue using electricity sparingly.” Related video click below: Eskom downgrades load shedding to stage 1
