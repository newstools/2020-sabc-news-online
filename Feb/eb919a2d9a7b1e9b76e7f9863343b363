The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape says it is fully behind party president, Cyril Ramaphosa, amid rumours about an attempt to remove him at the upcoming National General Council (NGC) of the party. The province is the second after Gauteng, to throw its weight behind Ramaphosa.  ANC Eastern Cape secretary, Lulama Ngcukayithobi, says they don’t expect any talk about an ousting. “We do not expect anybody or anyone or anything to talk to the leadership changes and so on including the ousting of the president. It will not happen. The ANC in the Eastern Cape will go to the NGC to make contributions on the organisational renewal and unity of the ANC as it has been articulated in our national conference. So we do not expect anything diverting from that dictum,” says Ngcukayithobi. Meanwhile, the ANC will not able to deliver on the programme of radical economic transformation if the party remains divided. This is word from ANC chairperson in the Northern Cape Zamani Saul who was addressing ANC delegates at the party’s two day lekgotla in Kimberley. Saul told delegates that the ANC should focus on uniting as a party and cleansing itself of destructive tendencies like self-entitlement. “We should see a leadership collective of the ANC that is committed to the renewal program to unite the ANC and ensure that we cleanse the movement from shallow destructive cultures. Why with all the privilege that has been accorded to us through the deployment processes of the movement we still want to steal?” asks Saul.
