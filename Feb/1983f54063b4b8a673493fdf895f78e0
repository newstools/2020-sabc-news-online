Trade union Numsa has expressed shock at South African Airways (SAA) decision to cancel all but one of its domestic routes as well as some international services. The airline announced on Thursday that it has taken the decision together with the Business Rescue Practitioners in an effort to make SAA profitable and sustainable. Unions have argued that the move will result in thousands of job losses. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi Majola says the unions were not consulted about the decision. “We are quite shocked and dismayed by the decision to cancel so many routes. This is going to have a devastating impact on the workforce. What they’ve done today (Thursday), we can’t express how shocked we are. What worsened the situation is that as we were engaging on this issue, they went and issued a statement to the media to show that there was no consultation with labour. To date we don’t have a business rescue plan. So how do they justify why they need to take such decisions?” Click on the video below:
