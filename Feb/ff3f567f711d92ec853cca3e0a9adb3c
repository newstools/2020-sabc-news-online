Sentencing proceedings in the Adam Catzavelos crimen injuria case are expected to get under way in the Randburg Magistrateâ€™s Court, north of Johannesburg on Thursday morning. The case follows a self-recorded video of Catzavelos in which he utters the K-word multiple times, while on holiday in Greece in August 2018. In the video, he is also seen celebrating the absence of black people at the beach. Catzavelos pleaded guilty to crimen injuria in December last year following two unsuccessful bids to have the charges withdrawn. However, both the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions and the National Director of Public Prosecutions denied his representations to drop the charge. In August, Catzavelos reached a settlement agreement with the South African Human Rights Commission in another case relating to the video. He was ordered to pay a fine of R150 000.
