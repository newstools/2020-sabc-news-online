The inquest into the death of anti-apartheid activist, Neil Aggett, will continue in the High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the then John Vorster Square Police Station on 5 February 1982. The security branch says he committed suicide but Aggett’s family strongly disputes that claim.
