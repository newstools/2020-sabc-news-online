Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu says society needs to reflect on the importance of the teaching professions as it often fails to get the credit it deserves. Mthembu was speaking at the 20th National Teachers Awards in Soshanguve, North of Pretoria where deserving educators were awarded accolades for their dedication in playing a positive role in the basic education sector. The awards are the Department of Basic Education’s way to acknowledge deserving teachers. Mthembu says despite the difficult working conditions these teachers work under, they continue to do their best. “The important work that teachers do in shaping our society is often not recognised or respected. As a former teacher myself, I know that teachers are indispensable. As a country we are proud of your relentless pursuit of excellence amidst unfavourable conditions such as resource constraints, violent protests in our communities, the prevalence of alcohol and drug abuse and other social ills.”
