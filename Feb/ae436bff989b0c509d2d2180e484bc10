It is still unclear if there will be a coalition between the Democratic Alliance (DA) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro despite talks between the two parties over the past few weeks. DA leader, John Steenhuisen, addressed members in Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth on the current state of the party in the Metro as part of his National Real State of the Nation Tour. He has made it clear that the DA doesn’t want to be in government for the sake of it, but wants a stable government that will last the course until next year’s municipal elections. “No we haven’t come to any conclusion, it’s basically talks and there were initial discussions. We obviously wanted to look at areas that did not work during the coalition and it was a frank and open discussion with the UDM about that, where both sides exchanged views around where things went wrong and where things could have been done better going forward. Mr [Bantu]Holomisa particularly wanted us to provide information, the evidence that has base to make the allegations against Mr [Mongameli] Bobani and his conduct and we committed to doing so and we will do that, that document is almost complete. We will give them time to consider it and give them time to respond. I remain committed to working with opposition parties to help build a new majority in South Africa,” says Steenhuisen.
