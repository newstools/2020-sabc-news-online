The union representing employees who were said to be appointed unlawfully at the SABC, Bemawu has welcomed Friday’s Labour Court decision. Earlier, the court dismissed the SABC’s application to reverse 28 appointments that the public broadcaster considered irregular. According to the SABC, the appointments violated company policy and were part of former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s legacy. Bemawu President Hannes Du Buisson says they are elated over the court judgment. “Unfortunately we did not get costs but the fact of the matter was that the application was dismissed. We are ecstatic about this decision; the fact of the matter is that those employees did not appoint themselves.” “There were certain instances that employees were appointed externally and did not know about any process of the SABC. So we are really glad that justice has been done in this instance. The SABC has the right to take this matter on appeal. We will defend it on appeal if it has been taken on appeal. But for now, there is nothing that is going to happen to those employees.” The SABC says it is currently studying the judgment. Watch Bemawu’s Hannes Du Buisson speaking about the court ruling below:
