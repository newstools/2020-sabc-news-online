Businessman Sisa Njikelana maintains that the security branch police murdered union organiser Neil Aggett. Njikelana testified at the inquest into Aggett’s death in the High Court in Johannesburg on Tuesday. He has concluded giving evidence and the hearing will continue with a new witness on Wednesday morning. Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the then John Vorster Square Police Station on February 5, 1982. His family has rejected the claims of security branch police that he committed suicide. Njikelana, who was detained at John Vorster Square at the same time as Aggett since 1981, says he had met him through the work they were both doing for their respective unions. He says, “My view hasn’t changed, Comrade Neil was killed.” Click below to watch related video:
