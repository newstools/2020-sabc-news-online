The former head of supply-chain at South African Technical Nontsasa Memela will be re-examined by her legal representative on Wednesday. Memela has been grilled for three days at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. She kept ducking and diving questions from the Commission and denied any wrongdoing during her testimony. She also denied favouring US-based company AAR to win a R1.3 billion tender contract to supply aircraft components for SAAT. Her three-day testimony has been defensive including accusations that the Commission’s evidence leader advocate Kate Hofmyer is hostile towards her. Memela accused advocate Kate Homyer of driving a certain narrative towards her with her questions. Her lawyer Lindelwa Mbanjwa also accused Hofmyer of being hostile towards her client. Memela also told Justice Zondo she did not see anything wrong when she did not advise SAAT board members they were not supposed to interact with AAR while the bidding process was still running. Memela explained how she and other SAAT board members were treated to limousine rides and transported by private jet while on an AAR sponsored trip in Chicago.  Earlier, Memela claimed she didn’t break any rules when she met with a bidder while a tender was still open.
