Eskom says it is unlikely to implement load shedding on Wednesday. The power utility says some of its generating units are back online. Spokesperson Sikhonathi Matshantsha has however warned that the current situation could change at short notice should the need arise: “Eskom does not expect to implement load shedding because some generating units are returning back to service. And that helps increase our capacity and avoid load shedding. However, we do remind customers that the system does remain tight. And we ask them to use electricity sparingly.”
