Chaos has erupted in Parow in Cape Town where angry community members are raiding and burning properties belonging to alleged drug dealers in the area. This follows the court appearance of 54-year old Moyhdine Pangarkar on charges of killing and kidnapping eight-year-old Tazne van Wyk of Connaught Estate in Elsies River. The man accused of the kidnapping and murder of Tazne has eleven previous convictions. They include murder, culpable homicide and child neglect. Pangarkar appeared briefly at the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town Friday morning. A large crowd gathered outside the court, demanding harsher sentences and a change to laws, governing parole. After court proceedings, two houses in Goodwood were set alight. It’s alleged the young victim was kept in one of the houses after her abduction. The angry mob is now busy identifying homes of alleged drug lords in retaliation to Tazne’s murder. Members of Public Order Police and Police officials are trying to mediate the situation.  Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato has meanwhile also arrived at the scene accompanied by bodyguards and law enforcement officers.
