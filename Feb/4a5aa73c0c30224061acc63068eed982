The Democratic Alliance (DA) Head of Policy Gwen Ngwenya has lashed out at former party leader Mmusi Maimane saying he has caused policy confusion in the party. Earlier on Monday the DA released its draft document on its Values and Principles. Ngwenya says it is now up to South Africans and DA members to scrutinise the policy document ahead of the party’s Policy Conference at the end of April this year. However she would not be drawn into giving the details of how Maimane left the party except to say policy uncertainty started happening at the time when Maimane was the party leader. “Mmusi left because of a very damning report which I won’t go into. He certainly did not leave because of policy uncertainty which he would have been responsible for as the leader of the party as well, but I don’t want that to be the subject of the press conference. The reality is that we’re asking questions from the party and the public, a question in my mind doesn’t reveal any ambiguity. There is no ambiguity.” Ngwenya has also defended her comments on how privileged she was, which she made after meeting with the last apartheid president, FW de Klerk. “I said it was a privilege to have spent the day and talk to him and there are many people which I would not give a wholesale endorsement to, but if I have the opportunity to spend the day with someone and get first hand insights into history, and to ask him for an example, did he have any doubts on the day he released Nelson Mandela? Or was there absolute conviction on the day? Not many people get the opportunity to ask someone first-hand what they thought at the moments in history and that quite frankly is the definition of privileged,” explains Ngwenya.
