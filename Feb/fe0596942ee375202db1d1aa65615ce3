The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says it will continue to push to regain power in the Tshwane Metro Municipality in Pretoria. The party in the council is again seeking to oust the already outgoing Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, through a vote of no confidence. ANC Gauteng Secretary, Jacob Khaw,e says they are in consultations with all political parties in the Tshwane council, except the DA, to find a quick way to return the metro to the ANC. The party in the province held its PEC Lekgotla earlier in February to pave the way for the year 2020. Khawe says they are very concerned about the situation in Tshwane. “The PEC today has also engaged and primarily the PEC question is, what will be the end game; what are the current state of affairs in Tshwane; what are the finances and what ‘happens’ if we take over, to correct the wrong that has been happening in the city. So, we’ll make sure we get that material and consult national leadership.” Mokgalapa has announced his intention to resign following internal investigations against him. The DA is probing him for alleged misconduct. This is after the controversial audio recording of him and the city’s former MMC for Roads and Transport, Shielah Senkubuge, surfaced.  The ANC says it cannot work with someone who has failed the people of Tshwane.
