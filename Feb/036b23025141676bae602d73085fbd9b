A learner from Ferndale High School in Randburg has died after he allegedly fell from the second storey of a building at the school. It’s understood that the boy learner had an epileptic fit which resulted in him loosing his balance and fell. Since the start of the 2020 academic year, this is the eleventh learner to have died in Gauteng. Spokesperson for the Gauteng Department of Education Steve Mabona explains, “Allegedly the boy learner experienced some seizure which emanates from a diagnosis of epilepsy. Unfortunately the boy fell from the second floor to down stairs. Emergency services was called and the boy was attended to on scene and later taken to a hospital, unfortunately the boy could not make it,” explains Mabona. The Gauteng Department of Education has dispatched its team of social workers to Ferndale High School to counsel learners and educators following the death of the learner. “The physio social team has been dispatched to go at the school to start with the work of counselling. They have been at the school already because after the incident they were dispatched to go to school and interact with the learners. Now that we have to announce the death of a learner they will also need to be at the school just to attend to all the learners that will need assistance and the educators and the family,” adds Mabona.
