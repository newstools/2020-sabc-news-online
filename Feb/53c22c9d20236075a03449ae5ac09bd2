The Gauteng Department of Education says it will launch an investigation into school bullying at Roodepark High School in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. The department says a learner involved in the incident is still in hospital and is being treated for bleeding on the brain. It has expressed disappointment that the school failed to inform the department of the incident that happened last Wednesday. Department Spokesperson, Steve Mabona, says both the learners have opened cases with the police. “We understand that the victim is still at hospital and bleeding and it is quite serious. We are concerned as the department that such an incident would occur in and around our school which is unacceptable. We cannot tolerate bullying in any form in and around our schools,” says Mabona.
