Polokwane Municipality Spokesperson, Tshidiso Mothapo has blamed load shedding for the Lepelle Northern Water board’s alleged failure to supply enough water to the municipal system. The water utility is an implementing agency of the Water and Sanitation Department. Residents of Polokwane and surrounding areas have been struggling with a lack of water. Mothapo says despite low dam levels, the water utility is giving them 60 million litres of water instead of 90 million litres. “The situation is being aggravated because some of the plants are affected by load shedding in the most high areas in the city, in Seshego. Rural areas are being affected and the municipality will continue with its project of underground water. Most of the boreholes have already been drilled. Now, we are equipping them and this should give us at least 19 mega litres.” Meanwhile, Dries Swart, who stays in Bendor, says the water that a municipal truck is delivering is brown. “You cannot wash; you cannot cook. Everytime you go to the municipality, there they tell you the same story. Water trucks were here on Friday – two of them. When you take the containers to refill, the water is brown. You cannot drink the water; you cannot bath with the water; and you can only use it for toilets.”
