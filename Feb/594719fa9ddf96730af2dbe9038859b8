Former SABC CEO Lulama Mokhobo says the public broadcaster’s former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng boasted about his close relationship with former president Jacob Zuma. Mokhobo was responding to Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s question about outside forces interfering in the affairs of the public broadcaster. Mokhobo is appearing for the second time at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown Johannesburg. Mokhobo says there were factions at the public broadcaster’s executive level. She says the were agendas and sub-agendas at executive level. “We certainly didn’t serve the same agenda. For me the agenda was very simple it was go in, make the organisation work, make sure that everything he does is lawful and ultimately make sure that its profitable.” “But there were other sub-agendas and certainly the interest of multichoice became paramount to Motsoengeng to the detriment of the organistion,” says Mokhobo. In the video below, Mokhobo continues her testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture  Last year, she told the commission that she had not agreed with the signing of the controversial R553 million deal between MultiChoice and the SABC because the process was flawed. She also said when she arrived at the SABC in 2012, she found that the Gupta linked The New Age (TNA) business breakfast briefings were flighted without a contract. Mokhobo said the idea behind the TNA breakfast briefings was to bring government to the people.
