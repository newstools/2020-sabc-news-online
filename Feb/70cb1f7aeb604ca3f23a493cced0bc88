Whatsapp users are being urged to update their mobile devices, after the messaging service announced that it will no longer work on millions of smart-phones that support outdated operating systems. Smartphones using Android 2.3.7 and older, and iPhone iOS 8 or older, are affected by the update. WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook, says the move is necessary to protect the security of its users. Techno industry head, Preetesh Sewraj explains the security threats of not updating your cellphone. “The first thing you need to do is go have a look if there is an upgrade available for your operating system for your device. If it is, upgrade as soon as possible and that will allow you to upgrade to the latest version, not for just Whatsapp but every single other app that you use. If you don’t do so then you are vulnerable to hackers.”
