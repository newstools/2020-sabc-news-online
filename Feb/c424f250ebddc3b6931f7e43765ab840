The SRC at the University of Fort Hare has expressed disappointment after murder accused student Yolanda Nogemane was granted bail by the Alice Magistrate’s Court in the Eastern Cape. She stands accused of stabbing to death fellow student Yonela Boli who is believed to have been in a romantic relationship with her. It is alleged that an argument ensued between the two in on the 9th of February following a night of drinking. The 24-year-old student was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his wounds. In the video below, an eyewitness gives his account of events.  Nogemane was granted a bail of R1000 with strict conditions. “I must say that we are disappointed because the state continues to fail us every now and then because Yolanda was granted bail at a price of thousand rand even though she took a life,” says SRC member for Transformation and Gender, Sesethu Mdekazi. In the video below, students are calling for no bail for Nogemane.  Boli was laid to rest at Seplan village in Cala on Saturday.
