Power utility Eskom says no load shedding is expected on Monday due to the planned return of four generation units, as well as adequate emergency reserves. However, it has warned that the system remains constrained and vulnerable and that it may have to implement load shedding at short notice. “Boosted by the return of four generating units to service, Eskom does not expect to implement load shedding as it will have sufficient generating capacity. Over the weekend, the system held up very well. We did not have to implement load shedding. However, we do remind the people of South Africa that the system does remain vulnerable thus we may have to implement load shedding at short notice,” says Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshatsha. The power utility has also reminded South Africans of the increased possibility of load shedding in the next 18 months. Below is Eskom’s full statement on load shedding :
