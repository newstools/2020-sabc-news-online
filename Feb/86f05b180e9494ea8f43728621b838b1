The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Student Representative Council (SRC) has distanced itself from the torching of an HIV Support Centre at its Howard College campus in Durban earlier on Monday. The building was set alight after initial attempts were foiled in the early hours of the morning. Meanwhile, Durban Metro police say students also petrol bombed a vehicle at the Edgewood campus in Pinetown. Rubber bullets were used to disperse the crowd. Protest action at the university began last week, with students demanding that historical debt be written off. The SRC spokesperson Sifiso Simelane has condemned the violence. “We’ve said that we are against that. We are calling upon the law enforcement officers to implement a situation whereby they are going to follow who is responsible. Burning property, we do not support that because that’s not our struggle. We are not aware who is burning buildings. The SRC is not burning any buildings. Those students who are owing the University, historical debt because differ in terms of categories. Those who are less than 350-thousand, they must be cleared without paying anything. NSFAS funded students, where am I going to get the money to pursue honours or masters. Secondly, there is an issue of residents. Students are sleeping outside,” explains Simelane.
