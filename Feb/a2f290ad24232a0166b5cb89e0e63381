Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says reports into the deaths of Parktown Boys High learner Enoch Mpianzi and Keamohetswe Seboko from Bekker Primary School in Magaliesburg will be finalised before the end of this month. He says preliminary reports have already been released and he is awaiting the final reports. The principals from both schools have been suspended pending investigations. Mpianzi died during a water activity at his school’s camp at Brits in the North West. It’s understood that Mpianzi was swept away after the makeshift raft he built together with other learners capsized. His family has since reiterated the call for justice to be served.
