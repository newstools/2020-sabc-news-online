In November 2018, former DA leader Mmusi Maimane asked President Cyril Ramaphosa about a payment to his son Andile Ramaphosa from Bosasa in a follow-up question in Parliament.  Ramaphosa claimed that the R500 000 payment had been made to his son, Andile Ramaphosa who had business interests with Bosasa (now known as African Global Operations).  Few days later in November, Ramaphosa claimed that the money had been paid to his son, and instead admitted that the funds had been paid in the form of a donation towards his quest to become ANC president.  In April 2019, Former DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu lodged complaints with the Public Protector.   In January 2020, pressure increased from inside and outside the ANC alliance, for Ramaphosa to remove Gordhan following rolling blackouts.  In January 2020, EFF leader Julius Malema said party MPs would disrupt president Cyril Ramaphosa’s February 13 State of the Nation Address (Sona) if he did not fire public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan. On Thursday, the African Transformation Movement has officially submitted its motion of no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa to National Assembly speaker Thandi Modise.  Ramaphosa’s battle with Mkhwebane stems from her finding that he deliberately lied to Parliament when he answered a question from former DA leader Mmusi Maimane in November 2018.
