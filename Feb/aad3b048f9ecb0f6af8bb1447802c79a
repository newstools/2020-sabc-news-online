President Cyril Ramaphosa has offered an apology to Economic Freedom Fighters leader, Julius Malema, after an MP accused him of assaulting his wife. Ramaphosa was speaking in Parliament replying to the State Of The Nation debate. The allegation was made by African National Congress MP Boy Mamabolo. Mamabolo made the claims during last week’s State of the Nation Address and repeated it in Tuesday’s debate on the SONA.
