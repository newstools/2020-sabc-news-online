A primary school principal has gone missing  at eDumbe, in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. According to his family, Edward Mthethwa left his home on Friday morning for Mahloni Primary School. It is alleged he was last seen delivering some documents to his district office. His wife, Nolwazi Mthethwa says the family is very concerned. “We last saw him when he left for work. There’s no information that we are getting about his disappearance. Police are looking but there hasn’t been substantial information. He hasn’t mentioned any problem to me at home also. All we know is that he was using his new car that he bought last week. So we think it could have been a hijacking but time is going and still nothing, he left on Friday morning. Police are investigating, we went to them today hoping they could help us access his bank account to get his statements and see his last transactions but they told us those things need to be cleared by a magistrate,” says Nolwazi.
