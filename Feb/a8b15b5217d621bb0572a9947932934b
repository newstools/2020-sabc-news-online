A group calling itself the “Radical Economic Transformation Forces” has re-pledged support for former President Jacob Zuma. The group says it will stop at nothing in supporting Zuma during his legal challenges. According to Umkhonto WeSizwe and Military Veterans’ Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus and hundreds of other REC members, who gathered at a hotel in Boosysens, in Johannesburg, the country’s judicial system was a sham, as it was being used to settle political scores in the African National Congress (ANC). He says the decision of the High Court in Pietermaritzburg to issue a warrant of arrest against Zuma is of great concern to all citizens of the country. “Judge Pillay plunged our judiciary straight into the political arena and shredded any hopes of former President Zuma, who has been subjected to vicious vilification in the court of public opinion, receiving a free and fair trial.”  Niehaus also has described as “fake news” a statement posted on the official Parliamentary Twitter account on Wednesday, saying Zuma will attend the State of the Nation Address tomorrow. In a tweet, Parliament confirmed Zuma’s attendance of the State of the Nation Address but later retracted it. He says as far as they know – as the Zuma support group knows – the former President is overseas for medical attention. Niehaus says he’s worried about Parliament’s narrative which implies that there are doubts that Zuma is not well. Meanwhile, the leader of Black Land First Andile Mngxitama says they will continue to support Zuma because he is under attack for pushing radical economic transformation.
