Lesotho’s First Lady Maesaiah Thabane has arrived in Lesotho after she fled the country a few weeks ago. The first lady was supposed to have handed herself to the police for questioning in connection with the assassination of the former first lady Dipolelo Thabane. Dipolelo was assassinated just two days before the inauguration of the Prime Minister Tom Thabane in 2017. Meanwhile witnesses in this case have requested police protection as they fear that they will face intimidation and harassment after they were not properly briefed that the case has been handed over to a new team of investigators. Tom Thabane’s phone has been linked to the crime scene and he has since been questioned by the police in that country. At the time Maesaiah Thabane was on the run and could not be reached.
