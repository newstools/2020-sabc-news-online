Johannesburg Mayor Geoffrey Makhubo plans to resuscitate the contract between the Joburg Metro Police Department and OUTsurance to reinstate points-men to manage traffic during peak hours and during load shedding. The contract was cancelled in September last year. Makhubo, who has been in the post for two months, plans to reverse a number of decisions taken by former Mayor Herman Mashaba – calling them populist, costly and deceptive. Makhubo was addressing the media about the state of the city following his appointment in December. “Populist policies and decision-making, by the former Executive Mayor in search of public-affirmation have rendered the city dysfunctional in many critical areas of the city service-delivery has been affected. For the purpose of today we have decided to specifically focus on key and immediate threats, particularly in the Emergency Services, Johannesburg Metro Police and on the insourcing of security officers in the city.” Statement of the Executive Mayor of Johannesburg, Cllr. Geoffery Makhubo   from SABC News   Meanwhile,  Makhubo says action will be taken against those responsible for the irregular appointment of more than 2000 security guards in 2019. The City of Joburg insourced around 5000 guards, after campaigning by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Makhubo says the number of officers hired were far more than what was needed. He says he has also discovered some serious irregularities in the appointment process. He says no action will be taken against the security officers, but anyone involved in irregularly appointing them will be held to account. “Currently, we have insourced 5.021 security officers, 2.110 more officers than targeted. The additional 2.110 people employed under the guise of insourcing were illegally recruited and smuggled into the City’s employ without any valid and legal process of employment.”
