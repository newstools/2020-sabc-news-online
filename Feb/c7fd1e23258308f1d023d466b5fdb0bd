A faction of the African National Congress (ANC) regional task team in Mangaung in the Free State has called for a probe into allegations of financial mismanagement in the embattled Metro. This comes as calls for Metro Executive Mayor Olly Mlamleli to step down intensify. Recently the metro has been downgraded twice by ratings agency, Moody’s.  Late last year, the municipality was placed under administration. ANC Mangaung Region Task Team deputy convenor, Patrick Monyakoane, says there’s no end to problems plaguing the municipality and called for urgent investigations. “The allegations stem from the Auditor General’s report. You can’t ignore the Auditor General’s report, it’s very serious.” “We need what happened in Matjhabeng to happen here. Consistency is very important when you deal with issues of municipalities and maladministration. Once you mention maladministration it simply says fraud and corruption.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
