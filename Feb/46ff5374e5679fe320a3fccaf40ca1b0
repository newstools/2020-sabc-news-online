The case against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has been postponed to May 8 in the East London Magistrate’s Court in the Eastern Cape. This is to allow the defence to consult with Malema after receiving both the docket and copies of the video footage taken on the day of the incident. The execution of the warrant has been stayed until the next court appearance. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says the execution of the warrant of arrest – against Malema – will not be effective until May 8, when he is due to appear in court again. Malema allegedly discharged a rifle during the EFF’s fifth anniversary celebrations at the Sisa Dukashe stadium in Mdantsane in 2018. NPA provincial spokesperson, Luxolo Tyali explains: “The warrant of arrest won’t be effective, it is just an external procedure by the court and the accused before court. The attorney made a prior arrangement before court and did not contest the warrant of arrest because it will not be effective until the next court appearance.” Below SABC News speaks to the NPA about Malema’s court appearaance:
