President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged all South Africans to mobilise behind the National Health Insurance (NHI) and ensure that it is implemented. Ramaphosa was speaking in his weekly letter from the President’s Desk. This as the Portfolio Committee on Health’s hearings on the NHI Bill, held around the country, wrap up. Ramaphosa says it is a travesty that access to decent; quality health care is determined by one’s ability to pay, saying this violates citizen’s constitutional right to health care. He says the introduction of the NHI will be among the most far-reaching acts of social transformation in the country since 1994. South Africa has enough resources to enable every citizen to receive standardised quality health care. Despite this President Ramaphosa says two parallel systems that are highly unequal in spend exist – based purely on one’s ability to access private medical insurance. Calling the situation inefficient and unjust, he has urged citizens to move away from a culture of self-interest and embrace the spirit of Ubuntu or solidarity as envisioned in the constitution. He says government will not be reckless in its implementation of the NHI, doing so incrementally and affordably with the aim of covering the whole country by 2025.
