Suspended George Mayor Melvin Naik has until the end of business on Wednesday to resign or face expulsion from his party. The Democratic Alliance (DA) gave him the ultimatum on Tuesday, following an investigation into allegations of corruption and interference in administrative processes.  A forensic investigation by the provincial Department of Local Government uncovered evidence that Naik received kickbacks worth R600 000 relating to a War-On-Waste project. Naik has continuously maintained his innocence. The DA Constituency Head for George Geordin Hill-Lewis says if Naik fails to resign, his party membership will cease and he will no longer be a municipal councillor in the Southern Cape town.
