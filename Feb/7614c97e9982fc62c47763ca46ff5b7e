Supporters of former president Jacob Zuma have criticised the issuing of a stayed warrant for his arrest should he fail to pitch for his next court appearance on May 6. Zuma arrived back in the country on Saturday after undergoing medical treatment in Cuba for an undisclosed illness. Zuma arrived back home from Cuba where he has been receiving medical treatment.  He told supporters at the OR Tambo International Airport that he would not lie about being ill and that he was prepared to go to jail if he were convicted of a crime. Jacob Zuma spoke briefly at OR Tambo International Airport where he was welcomed by throngs of his supporters.  Chairperson of Zuma’s support group, Nkosentsha Shezi says, “We are talking about a man who gave his entire life for the freedom of this country even for the freedom of that judge Dhaya Pillay to come now and question the medical certificate to tell us that it’s not authentic and to an extent of issuing a warrant of arrest its vilification of president Jacob Zuma it is very personal.”
