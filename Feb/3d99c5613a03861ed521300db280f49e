The University of Fort Hare in the Eastern Cape has suspended academic activities at its Alice campus. The campus has been marred by a violent protest, with students demanding stringent safety measures after a stabbing incident resulted in a death on campus. Olwethu Tshefu was killed off campus Saturday morning. He was a friend of Yolena Boli who was stabbed to death earlier in February allegedly by his girlfriend. It is believed that Tshefu was one of the witnesses in the case. Tshefu was allegedly walking with a group of friends, when he was stabbed by an unknown man in his upper body. The students are also demanding the resignation of Vice Chancellor, Professor Sakhela Buhlungu who they accuse of not having their interest at heart. It is estimated that nearly 3 000 students have not registered due to outstanding debt. Police have confirmed the arrest of 11 students for public violence and are due to appear in the Alice Magistrate Court.   University spokesperson, Thandi Mapukata says: “The university invoked an existing court interdict that was granted to the university at the beginning of the year where students again were striking, preventing registration from happening.” “Before the court interdict was invoked the registra issued a warning to students informing them that they should refrain from disturbing the peace and preventing academic activities at the university.” In the video below, Fort Hare SRC president, Sipho Nqabeni condemns the acts of violence as it undermines what they are trying to achieve
