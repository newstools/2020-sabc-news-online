The Western Cape government says the majority of the province’s residents reject the National Health Insurance Bill (NHI). The NHI Bill is intended to provide access to quality health care services to all South Africans irrespective of their social status. Public hearings were held in the province last week and a number of concerns were raised by residents. Democratic Alliance (DA) Member of the Provincial Legislature, Wendy Philander, says residents agree that the Bill lacks a clear strategy and does not address the importance of sound governance structures, required for quality health care services. Philander says the party rejects the Bill in its current form. “In the Western Cape we have valid concerns on the dire need for health infrastructure repair, additional medical personnel and ethical, good governance of health care systems in order to provide quality care to all citizens. These are valid concerns that the NHI Bill in its current form fails to address and I sincerely hope that submissions made by citizens are taken into serious consideration,” says Philander.
