The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) says it has implemented additional procedures for all vessels entering South African ports, following the outbreak of the Coronavirus in China.  The death toll in China has risen to 259 with more than 11 000 cases of the virus now confirmed on the mainland.  Acting Chief Harbour Master Captain Sabelo Mdlalose says no vessels will be allowed to dock at harbours until they have received clearance from health authorities. “In addition to the current standing procedures, TNPA in alignment with the Port Health and the Department of Health has put in stringent measures to screen all vessels calling into our South African ports. All suspected vessels will be placed under quarantine until clearance is received from relevant authorities. Measures have been put in place to make sure that people are not allowed to interact with suspected vessels up until those vessels are cleared.” <span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
