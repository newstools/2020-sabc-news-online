SABC meteorologist Mduduzi Mthembu says there is still warning of heavy rains expected in Gauteng on Saturday night, even though the downpours are should be expected to move towards Mpumalanga and KwaZulu Natal. This is after homes were flooded, leaving scores of residents counting their loss. Mthembu says people who live in flood-prone areas need to be on high alert, as the heavy rains will affect them badly. He adds that environmental pollution also contribute in the floods that the province is experiencing. “The storm drainage system in the province is not copying with this kind of rainfall, and the concrete surface in Gauteng also contributes in causing floods. Urban areas are more likely to experience flooding, because the water does not penetrate in the deep grounds.”  Mthembu says from Sunday the heavy rains will also be expected in Mpumalanga and northern KwaZulu-Natal. “It is typical for the country to experience this kind of weather, especially at this time of the year and with the rainfall season.” He says from Wednesday, South Africans are more likely to see better weather, as the system will move off the country.
