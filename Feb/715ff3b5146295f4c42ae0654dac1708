Former President Thabo Mbeki is attending the two-day African National Congress (ANC) KwaZulu-Natal PEC political school in Durban and is expected to address the matter of the renewal of the party. This is the second time that Mbeki addresses the party’s gathering in the province since he stepped down in 2008 as state president. Last year, the former President addressed party branches during a memorial lecture of the late Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe – also in Durban. ANC KZN provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala says the former President will on Sunday address the provincial leadership on the renewal of the ANC. He says : “Well former President will be contributing on the question of the renewal of the ANC, how and what are the current tasks in relation to the renewal of the ANC as the leader of the society and an agent for change. He is well received like all former Presidents of the movement. Members of the ANC like to engage with him at the political level; like they do when they engage with people and former Presidents like President Zuma, the current President of the ANC, comrade [Kgalema] Motlanthe and others. So we make use of all leaders of the ANC without being selective.”
