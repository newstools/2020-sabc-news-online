The Alice Magistrate Court in the Eastern Cape is expected to hear the bail application of 24 year-old University of Fort Hare student, Yolanda Nongemane, who is facing a charge of murder. She allegedly stabbed her 24 year-old boyfriend, Yonela Bolo, on campus last week. Nongemane appeared in court last week. During the appearance students were divided whether she should receive bail or not. The case has brought the institution’s psychological services under the spotlight with students accusing it of failing to provide psychological support when in need. Fort Hare management says it is providing the necessary support. A large crowd of students is expected to picket at court. The SRC pledged its support to the deceased’s family in this matter.
