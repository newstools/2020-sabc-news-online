 North West Premier Job Mokgoro, will deliver his State of the Province Address (SOPA) on Friday at the provincial legislature in Mahikeng. Opposition parties in the province and community members are hoping that Mokgoro’s address will focus on service delivery. They say service delivery has collapsed across the province. The SOPA is expected to focus on the report regarding the province’s service delivery programme. That includes the collaborative efforts to improve delivery of basic services, as well as initiatives aimed at boosting the province’s social and economic infrastructure projects. Premier spokesperson Vuyisile Ngesi says, “It will be good to remember and bear in mind that in the 2019 SOPA the Premier made a couple of commitments. There are a wide range of issues that the Premier will be reporting back on.” Ngesi says the Premier will also reflect on the progress made, since the provincial government was placed under administration in 2018. The North West locals outline what they expect from the speech, “The Premier must also outline the mechanism that is going to guide the implementation of those plans. Because without the mechanism his speech will just be another ordinary speech.” “What we want to hear the Premier saying in his SOPA speech is about service delivery of the people of North West. Our roads, people’s houses, building houses, giving people water and electricity,” says one of the local resident.
