The court battle for the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State continues. The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein has granted a disgruntled group leave to appeal. In 2019, their case was struck off the roll by the High Court in Johannesburg with costs. The group sought to nullify the ANC Provincial List Conference arguing that it was illegitimate. They want the current ANC Provincial Executive Committee disbanded. Group Spokesperson Monnapule Ntamo says they are happy with the development. “Remember, we’ve been saying that the Bloemfontein (High Court) has not really fairly treated us on the previous case including when they even refused to give us a right to appeal. We are very glad that the appeal court has finally found a way of granting us a hearing on our case and we believe that now there will be fairness.”
