Political Analyst Somadoda Fikeni says the battle between President Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane may spill over into the political arena. The African National Congress (ANC) is already divided on whether Mkhwebane must remain in office or be removed, as some feel that she is targeting the party president.  Fikeni says it is obvious that Ramaphosa’s CR-17 campaign donations report by Mkhwebane, which is now on judicial review, will be used in factional battles towards the National General Council in June. “This case becomes that much crucial, because if it tilts one way it may be used as part of the proxy wars of ANC factional battles, so whatever the outcome of the case, it will be politically weaponised by one faction or the other. Should the Public Protector lose then you would have a lot more pressure on her case in Parliament. Should the Public Protector win the same will be used by Ramaphosa’s opponents.” However, ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says the party fully supports Ramaphosa and Chapter Nine Institutions. “The ANC has got confidence in all Chapter Nine Institutions – and we have expressed that in all our statements and we have got confidence in our President Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC and the Republic, elected to lead the country and lead the organisation and we believe that it must be all hands on deck – so we be able to drive that programme further forward.”
