The South African Weather Service has forecast heavy rains and thunderstorms across KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend. It says up to 60% rain is predicted for both Saturday and Sunday, bringing with it a respite from the heatwave that has been gripping the province in recent days. However, forecaster Stacey Colborne says no warnings have been issued yet. “You can expert 60% of showers and thunderstorms in the whole province as of today which include Jozini area.” “At this stage, we don’t have any warnings of severe thunderstorms but moderate showers and thunderstorms are expected. On Saturday we expect 60% showers and rain over most of the province which resulted from cold conditions in the province. Sunday, it will clear-up and clouding-up again in the afternoon.” Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka commented on severe storms that occurred in late 2019 in KwaZulu-Natal, when over 200 homes and other infrastructure were damaged by heavy rains.
