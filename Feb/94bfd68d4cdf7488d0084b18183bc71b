Gauteng Premier David Makhura says radical economic transformation will be a daily occurrence in the province for the next decade. He’s currently delivering his State of the Province Address (SOPA) in Garankuwa, north of Pretoria. Makhura says this year’s SOPA is about a plan of action that will see implementation taking place across the province. Makhura is addressing a packed indoor sport centre of the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University.   “It is about building a society that protects and cares for the most vulnerable in our communities, this plan of action is about ending crime including the scourge of gender-based violence and creating a safe and cool environment for all. It about building a growing inclusive economy that creates more jobs and offers opportunities to all South Africans.” Makhura has also highlighted climate change as an existential threat to South Africans, saying it needs to be addressed. Global concerns over the impact of climate change have led to calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of global warming – amid instances of climate-related extreme weather, such as wildfires and floods. This year’s #GPSOPA2020 is more than a speech.
