The Kenyan Education Ministry has dispatched a team to go to the west of the country where 14 learners died while at least 39 others were seriously injured in a stampede at a primary school. Local media reports indicate that a teacher at Kakamega primary school was beating some learners and this prompted other learners to run down a staircase. In the process, some fell and were trampled to death. Police have confirmed the report, saying 20 other learners from the school were admitted to a health facility and have since been discharged. The Minister for Education Professor George Magoha has sent a message of condolences and has also dispatched one of his senior government officials from Nairobi to go to Kakamega where the school is, to find out exactly what happened. At this point, we do not know if the school will be closed, but there is a sense of shock not just at the school where the incident happened but even in the country. Click on the video below:
