State-owned freight and rail company Transnet has appointed Portia Derby as its new Group CEO. The former Director-General of the Department of Public Enterprises succeeds Siyabonga Gama who was fired in October 2018 following a legal battle with the Transnet board. Gama was implicated in the irregular procurement of more than 1000 locomotives through a contract that escalated from an initial R38.6-billion to more than R54-billion. In a statement Transnet says she will work with the board, management and other stakeholders to rebuild an institution that was severely affected by state capture and large-scale corruption.
