Alice in the Eastern Cape is under water after it was hit by a massive storm on Sunday afternoon. Several homes including new RDP houses have collapsed and businesses and streets are flooded. The heavy rain accompanied by strong winds hit the Raymond Mhlaba municipality up to Bhisho and surrounding areas under the Buffalo City Metro. Residents are now collecting what’s left of their houses and furniture. A resident from Gaga village, Qhamani Nkohla describes the devastation. “Heavy rainfall that occurred over two hours ago took houses and churches including house furniture. Appliances are ruined. The situation right now is too bad.”
