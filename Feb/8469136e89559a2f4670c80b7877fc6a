The South African National AIDS Council (Sanac) has expressed disappointment with the suspension of the HIV vaccine trial in South Africa. Sanac CEO Doctor Sandile Buthelezi says they were hoping for positive results following the numerous large sums invested in this trial. Buthelezi says, “But this is not the end of the road, there are still other trials ongoing but we also have a number of other prevention initiatives that we are pulling together to address the infections. We are actually looking forward… we think we are still going to draw a lot of lessons in how we actually address HIV prevention in future from the same trial that has been discontinued.” The HVTN 702 trial which was tested on over 5000 men and women, proved to be ineffective in preventing HIV infection. The trial was the largest and most advanced HIV vaccine trial to take place in South Africa, the country with the largest HIV infections in the world. WATCH
