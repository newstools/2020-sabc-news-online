Eskom says it does not expect to implement rotational load shedding on Saturday and the probability of load shedding is low for the weekend. The power utility says some generation units are planned to return to service early next week, which will further improve the power system outlook for the coming week. Eskom is reminding customers that the generation system remains constrained, vulnerable and unpredictable. As such, load shedding could be implemented at short notice if there is a change in the generation system performance.  Meanwhile, Eskom CEO Andre De Ruyter has acknowledged that the problems at the power utility have a negative impact on people. He received a list of demands from Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema in Sunninghill, north of Johannesburg.

De Ruyter says he’ll engage with the EFF leaders and find an amicable solution to the problem of load shedding in the country. “I want to thank you for caring enough about Eskom, to march peacefully all the way to Megawatt Park today (Friday), we appreciate it. We take your commitment seriously and we’ll engage with your leadership and understand your memorandum fully. We will consider and engage and debate, thank you very much.” In the video below Julius Malema addresses, marchers gathered in Sandton
