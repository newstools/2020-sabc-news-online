Agri Western Cape says it does not fully agree with the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for land redistribution and reform. The agricultural union says it has submitted its comments to Parliament. Chief Executive Officer, Jannie Strydom, says Section 25 is not an obstacle to land reform, nor does it require fair and equitable compensation. Strydom says the proposed amendment which will allow for land expropriation without compensation will not fix institutional ineffectiveness such as lack of budgeting and corruption. “The real problems are a lack of implementation and poor implementation of existing legislation and programs, an insufficient budget and corruption. Agri Western Cape is dedicated to be part of the solution for successful land reform and contribute to a solution-driven land reform policy ensuring increased agricultural production and food security for the Western Cape and South Africa,” says Agri Western Cape CEO, Jannie Strydom.
