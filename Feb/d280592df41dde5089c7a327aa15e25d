Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato says the killing of children cannot be allowed to carry on. He says the attitude of some older men towards little children needs special attention. Plato was speaking at the funeral service of murdered eight-year-old Tazne van Wyk in Elsies River in the Cape Flats. Van Wyk’s body was found in a stormwater drain in Worcester in the Boland last week. Family member Samantha Viljoen says Tazne’s murder could’ve been prevented  Plato thanked everyone who helped to apprehend the suspect. “I want to thank all the councilors, community leaders, the moms, and the dads. We were out in full force. Over 300 walking busses and members of the public, searching, looking. The Pink Ladies, the Missing Children’s Network, even SAPS.” Plato says communities and politicians must work together to protect children. “Tazne did not deserve to die like that. Her mother, father, brothers, and sisters will not see their child finish matric. A mother and a father will not see their daughter getting married. They will not see the children of their daughter. Tazne died well before her time.” PAROLE SYSTEM UNDER SPOTLIGHT Also addressing mourners, Western Cape Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo says the government system has failed Van Wyk. This after it emerged that the murder suspect was previously released on parole on 11 counts, including murder assault, culpable homicide and child kidnapping. President Cyril Ramaphosa says there’s a need to relook at the parole system. Meanwhile, Western Cape Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Nissen has appealed for calm among communities in the Cape Flats. He was also speaking at the funeral service of Tazne.
