Public hearings on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill in Beaufort West in the Central Karoo were concluded this past weekend. Parliamentâ€™s Portfolio Committee on Health visited the area to hear the views of residents on the issue. Residents raised concerns about severe shortages of medical staff at public hospitals. They say it sometimes takes an entire day to see a doctor or a nurse. They also feel the Bill gives the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, too much power, leaving room for corruption and nepotism. Dates of the last leg of the public hearings on the Bill due to be held in Gauteng will be announced soon.   Watch Health Minister Zweli Mkhize breakdown the costs to implement the NHI.
