Legal expert, Ulrich Roux says former president Jacob Zuma can be taken into custody if he does not prove that he was ill. This is after the Pietermaritzburg High Court issued a warrant of arrest for Zuma due to his failure to appear in court on Tuesday, expressing dissatisfaction with the contents of the medical certificate that Zuma’s legal team submitted. The legal team says it will not challenge the issuing of the warrant of arrest – which has been stayed until May 6. Zuma and co-accused French arms manufacturer, Thales – are facing multiple charges including corruption, money laundering and racketeering. “The doctor who has diagnosed him, or allegedly diagnosed him, had not inserted his practice number or his registration number on the note. There were some corrections made on the note and the state, in my opinion, correctly pointed out to the court that we cannot believe the content of this note, we cannot take it as being original and accurate and the court must scrutinize this note. I think we need to provide clarity on the warrant of arrest. It was issued yesterday and not circulated. If however, on May 6, he returns to court and does not convince the court that he was indeed ill, then that warrant can be activated and he could be taken into custody.” Watch for more:
