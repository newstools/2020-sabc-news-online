The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania says it will fight for better recognition of its founder, Robert Sobukwe. The party says it will pass a motion in Parliament to have Sobukwe’s legacy remembered in the same way as that of the country’s former presidents. The PAC and the Robben Island Museum on Monday launched Robert Sobukwe month. The late struggle icon spent six years in solitary confinement on Robben Island before he was released and banished to Galeshewe in Kimberley in the Northern Cape. He died of lung cancer in 1978 at the age of 53. PAC leader Mzwanele Nyhontso says Sobukwe deserves better recognition. “Fortunately I am the member of parliament. I will make that motion and submit it in parliament he must be recognised, Sobukwe deserves better. The parliament of this country must recognise him, they can’t recognise De Klerk they can’t recognise Botha who persecuted  and killed our leaders and yet ignore our own leaders.” Watch related video:
