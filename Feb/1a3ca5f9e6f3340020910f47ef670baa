The death of 23-year old budding musician Lindokuhle Cele has sparked anger and frustration in uMlazi, Durban and on social media.  Social media expressed the brutality of this killing under #Justice4Lindo. A man  believed to be from the same area as Lindokuhle (also known as Lindo) is accused of allegedly stabbing Lindo and left a knife stuck in the eye. It is understood that the incident was a homophobic attack, as the accused and victim are known to each other. Family spokesperson and Lindo’s aunt, Nombuso Cele confirmed the death to SABC News.  Nombuso says Lindo was recently stabbed numerous times at a local shop in uMlazi and died at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. “While he was waiting [at the shop] the culprit took out his knife and started stabbing him on the spine and left a knife in his left eye.  Lindo asked the culprit to have messy on him.” Nombuso says the incident was a homophobic attack as the perpetrator was against Lindo being gay, “the culprit said in his life he has never seen a beautiful guy who is famous and loved by many people.” Nombuso described Lindo as a loving person, “Lindo was a chubby young man who was always laughing, smiling and somebody who wouldn’t even kill a fly.” Click link for full interview  Emotional Nombuso pleaded with the public to stop the killings. “It does not matter who you are, we are all human beings.
