Three suspects will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court on Monday in connection with drugs worth over R20-million that were confiscated at OR Tambo International Airport east of Johannesburg. Two suspects who arrived from South America were arrested after drugs were found in their check-in luggage. A third suspect, a South African, was arrested after he attempted to leave the country with drugs in his possession. National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo says all the suspects will appear for drug-related charges. “The female was carrying about 21 kilos of what is suspected to be cocaine in a check-in luggage and a male was carrying just over three kilos of cocaine that was tightly wrapped around his waist. Both suspects were profiled then they were searched and drugs were found on them. They are currently in police custody. A 50-year-old South African man attempted to smuggle drugs out of South Africa to Hong Kong. He too was profiled and eventually searched and drugs found wrapped around his belly.” Click on the video below:
