Residents of Tshwane and Ekurhuleni metro municipalities are warned of water supply cut-offs from 1 o’clock on Saturday afternoon. Rand Water will be carrying out emergency repair work on one of its leaking pipeline that supplies water to various reservoirs.  The City of Tshwane says areas that are likely to be affected includes Centurion, Erasmia, Kosmosdal, Valhalla, Laudium and Attridgeville. Rand Water spokesperson Justice Mohale says in Ekurhuleni the water cuts will impact the Germiston and Bedfordview areas. “This has been prompted by the fact that we are trying to fix a leak on 05 pipeline which supplies part of Ekurhuleni. This will commence today at 1 o’clock until 1’o clock tomorrow which means it’s going to be 24 hours.  We’d like to apologise for any inconvenience that might have been caused by this,” says Mohale.
