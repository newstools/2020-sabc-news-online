The trial of controversial pastor Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused resumes in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday. This after the defence failed on its Constitutional Court bid to dismiss a ruling by Judge Irma Schoeman, allowing the entire trial to be heard in the Port Elizabeth court. Omotoso and his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are facing 63 main and 34 alternative charges including sexual assault, human trafficking and rape. In the last court seating state prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa told Judge Irma Schoeman that the state was ready to continue with the trial, after the decision from the Constitutional Court. She ruled that the Port Elizabeth High Court has the jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case. The defence wanted the trial to be heard in various courts around the country, as some of the alleged offences on the indictment occurred elsewhere. The trial is expected to see its first witness take the stand on Monday since starting afresh in 2019.
