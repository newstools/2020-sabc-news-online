ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile says the party’s fragmented unity is worrying. He was the keynote speaker at the ANC’s 108th birthday celebrations in Mpumalanga. The party’s provincial elective conference in Mpumalanga will be held in the first quarter of 2020.  Three people, Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane, acting provincial chairperson Mandla Ndlovu and the MEC of sports and recreation, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali; are contending for the position of provincial chairperson. Mashatile says a lot needs to be done to unite the party. “Comrades, our movement is facing one of its most difficult periods since historic Morogoro conference in 1969. Just like in Morogoro, the moment in which we find ourselves requires us to act with speed and decisiveness to unite and renew our movement. Since our national conference in Nasrec, we have made progress in uniting and renewing the ANC. However, a lot needs to be done.” The ANC’s acting provincial chairperson Mandla Ndlovu said members should raise their concerns through the party’s established channels. “There is no person that is going to disrupt this event of the ANC. If people have problems in the ANC, there are clear processes that they may use to address their concerns. You go to your branch; if you are not happy, you will always go up in the ANC.”
