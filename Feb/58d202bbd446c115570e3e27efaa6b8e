Health officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) say they have put in place measures to detect the new Coronavirus outbreak at airports and seaports across the country. The DRC is grappling with other epidemics like Ebola in eastern DRC, cholera, monkeypox and measles that have killed thousands of people since 2018.  The DRC government says it has started screening passengers from China for the Coronavirus outbreak at all their points of entry. It also advised its citizens against making trips to China until the disease is contained. The World Health Organization (WHO) has appealed for more funds from donors to deal with epidemics in the DRC. The surveillance measures aimed at preventing the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak will put a strain on the country and the international communityâ€™s resources.
