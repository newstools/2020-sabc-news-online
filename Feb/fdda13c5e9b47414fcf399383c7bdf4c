The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Friday continue to focus its attention on corruption at State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). In 2017, the Auditor-General conducted an audit on South African Airways (SAA) and found that it had failed to comply with the Public Finance Management Act. SAA was in a dire financial state in 2017 and could not release a financial statement and the Auditor-General could not audit the airline. This was according to testimony given on Thursday by the business executive in the Auditor-Generalâ€™s office, Polani Sokombela. He will continue to testify at the commission on Friday. In its final round of hearings into aviation-related matters, the commission heard how SAA appointed the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Nkonki auditors without following any procurement procedures. This constituted to irregular expenditure for SAA for four years. Evidence will explain how the two firms then appointed the services of another auditing firm, Kwinana and Associates, which belonged to board member Yakhe Kwinana. The commission is also expected to hear evidence from PwC. Watch: SAA has inconsistently submitted audit reports  Previous witnesses on SAA:
