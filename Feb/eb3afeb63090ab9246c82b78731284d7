Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi has expressed shock and dismay about the child to teacher violence in South African schools. She was addressing thousands of learners at the Canana Academy Junior Secondary School in Dutywa in the Eastern Cape. Tunzi believes that respect should be prioritised in the country. “It’s so unfortunate what has been happening in South Africa, watching so many students fighting with teachers, we have seen this happening right last year, we have seen this happening like many years before. This is 2020 and I am hoping that this year we can all do better and respecting each other, it goes with teachers as well because respect goes both ways, students respect teachers and teachers respect students.” Learners could not contain their excitement when meeting Miss Universe.  Tunzi arrived in South Africa over the weekend. This is Tunzi’s first time on the African soil since being crowned Miss Universe in December.  Crowds gathered at the OR Tambo International Airport on Saturday to welcome her back.
