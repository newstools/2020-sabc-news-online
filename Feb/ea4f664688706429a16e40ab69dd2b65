The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will resume hearings in Parktown in Johannesburg on Monday with evidence expected from Thalente Myeni, who is the son of former SAA board chair, Dudu Myeni. Dudu Myeni was also chair of the board of Mhlathuze Water at Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal. The commission will probe alleged tender irregularities between the state-owned entity, Mhlathuze Water, which is based at Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal, and  Thalente’s company, Premier Attraction. Last week, the commission wrapped up the evidence of former supply-chain head at South African Airways (SAA) Technical, Nontsasa Memela. Her testimony highlighted her alleged cosy relationship with JM Aviation Director, Vuyisile Ndzeku, who won a R1.3 billion contract with SAA Technical in 2016. Memela also told the commission she did not see a conflict of interest when a bidding company paid R2.5 million towards the purchase of her property. She denied any wrongdoing in her department. “It’s as if I was actually far more senior than the board. If I did know Chair, I would say then unknowing to myself I was a minister just giving instructions. I reported to people, I was HOD and I played my role to the best of my ability. But where I have to answer on behalf of the acting CEO, means I have that power to influence the acting CEO and the person who owned the GPU’s and the list goes on. So no I did not have any influence,” said Memela.
