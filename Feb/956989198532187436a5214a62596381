Eskom says it will comply with the court order setting aside its R3.7 billion coal contract with the formerly Gupta-owned mining group Tegeta Exploration & Resources. The power utility says the termination of the contract will not affect the supply of coal at its Majuba Power Station.  The Special Investigations Unit secured a High Court order to cancel the 10-year contract. The court order also granted the SIU leave to institute legal proceedings against Tegeta. Eskom’s spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the utility will assist in attempts to ensure that the funds lost to corrupt contracts are recovered. “We will comply with the court order and we will assist the courts and law enforcement agencies to deal with state capture and its consequences. So we welcome this court judgment and we assure the people of SA that Eskom will continue with its services.” In the video below, the SABC reports on the High Court declaring the contract between Eskom and Tegeta Exploration & Resources unlawful:
