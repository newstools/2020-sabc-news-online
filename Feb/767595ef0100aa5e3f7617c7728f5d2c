The African National Congress (ANC) has distanced itself from comments made by its Member of Parliament (MP) Supra Mahumapelo regarding the removal of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Mahumapelo says the ANC in Parliament will not support the motion for Mkhwebane’s removal. He says the governing party will use its majority in Parliament to block Mkhwebane’s axing. In a statement, the ANC says Mahumapelo’s comment was made in his own capacity and that the party has not yet discussed its position on the matter. It adds that once a stance was made in regard to the motion it will be communicated by the ANC Caucus in Parliament. New rules which provide for the removal of heads of Chapter 9 institutions were adopted by the national legislature in 2019. In January, Parliamentary Speaker Thandi Modise, approved a motion submitted by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to establish an inquiry into whether Mkhwebane should be removed from office on the grounds of alleged misconduct, incapacity and incompetence.
