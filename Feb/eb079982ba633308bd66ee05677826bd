The investigation into the killing of Samantha Radebe – a woman from Alexandra killed in a police shooting – is in its final stages, according to police investigative directorate IPID. IPID confirmed that Radebe 31, was shot and killed by a police-issued firearm, during a shootout between police and alleged criminals in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, in January. Another bystander was also wounded during the incident. IPID spokesperson Sontaga Siesa says, “We do confirm that our investigation with regards to Samantha Radebe’s death is almost complete. We are just waiting for the outcome in terms of the DNA and we have since gotten the results that the firearm that killed Samantha actually came from a police officer’s firearm…” “At this point in time we cannot mention the name of the police officer and we will do so as time goes on,” added Siesa. In an Imbizo held by the Police Ministry in Alexandra on Sunday, residents expressed their concerns about the scourge of crime, drugs and alleged police corruption in the township. In January, Alexandra residents marched to the local police station, demanding answers following the fatal shooting of Radebe. Community members blamed one of the police officers for the killing of Radebe and claimed that it was not the first time that the officer was involved in the killing of innocent civilians.
