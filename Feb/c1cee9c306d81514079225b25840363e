Two final year Information Technology students at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) have invented a device that will assist the visually impaired move freely and know exactly where they are going. C4Me (See for me), as the invention is called, enables the visually impaired to avoid obstacles. Siphamandla Mqcina and Philanjalo Ndlovu have been working on the device since June 2019. They recently travelled to Toronto, Canada, where they presented their device at a global workshop. Mqcina and Ndlovu have been studying Computer Industrial Systems at TUT’s Soshanguve South Campus for the past three years. Mqcina says an encounter with a visually impaired student inspired their invention. “C4Me was inspired here on campus. We were walking and when we looked, we found that the person cannot see. So we felt guilty about it and we sat around and discussed the issue. We discussed on how we can help that person with the knowledge that we have about technology.” Mqcina and Ndlovu have been spending their own money, even sacrificing their bursaries, to ensure that C4Me succeeds. Ndlovu says their biggest challenge now is getting developers and sponsors on board to assist in manufacturing their device. “Right now we need money; we need funds, we need people with experience, we need everyone who can help us so that we can make C4Me and help people who can’t see.” FOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
