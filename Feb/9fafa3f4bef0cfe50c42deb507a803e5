Three people arrested at the OR Tambo International Airport east of Johannesburg after police confiscated drugs worth over R20 million from them will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Two suspects arriving from South America were arrested after drugs were found in their check-in luggage. A third suspect, a South African, was arrested after he attempted to leave the country with drugs in his possession. National Police Spokesperson Vish Naidoo says all the suspects will be charged with being found in possession of drugs. “The female was carrying about 21 kilos of what is suspected to be cocaine in a check-in luggage and a male was carrying just over three kilos of cocaine that was tightly wrapped around his waist. Both suspects were profiled then they were searched and drugs were found on them. They are currently in police custody. “A 50-year-old South African man attempted to smuggle drugs out of South Africa to Hong Kong. He too was profiled and eventually searched and drugs found wrapped around his belly.”
