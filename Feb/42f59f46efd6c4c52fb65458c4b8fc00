Supporters of former South African Airways (SAA) chairperson, Dudu Myeni have assaulted a member of the Organisation of Undoing Tax Abuse’s (OUTA) legal team and verbally threatened its advocate, Carol Steinberg at the High Court in Pretoria. OUTA and the SAA Pilots’ Organisation have taken Myeni to court to have her declared as a delinquent director for the “rest of her life” after the national carrier was plunged into chaos during her six-year tenure as board chair. Additional security will now be deployed when the case resumes on Monday. Steinberg told the court that she feels threatened and scared and that it is not conducive for her to continue with her work. Judge Ronel Tolmay has urged everyone to respect the Constitution and said she would ask for extra security at the court. Earlier, Myeni denied that it was solely her responsibility to call a board meeting to finalise an Airbus deal that could have saved SAA billions of rands. SAA and Airbus negotiated a deal where A320 aircraft would be swapped for A330s, without it costing the national carrier a cent.
