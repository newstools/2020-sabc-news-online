The multi-million-rand refurbished Giyani Water Works in Limpopo is not working. The Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation has heard that the project was handed over to the District Municipality with technical faults. More than R35 million is now needed to repair the refurbished Giyani Water Works. Former president Jacob Zuma officially launched the project in October 2014. The committee is on a visit to check the progress made on the project. Its chairperson Machwene Semenya says the money paid to the contractor must be recouped. “We have said to the district municipality in terms of the project management principle before a person hands over a project, the engineer was supposed to sign for it. We are questioning where was the municipality? Why did they receive the project that has got geological problems and we are saying they must actually use the legal route to get the money back so that they can fix it,” says Semenya.
