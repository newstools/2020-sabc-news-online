The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has called on Eskom to explain why its board failed to appear before the committee on Tuesday. The board was expected to give an update on the power utility’s operations. Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter and other executives attended the meeting, but interim board Chairperson Malegapuru Makgoba and other members failed to appear. Scopa Chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa has described the board’s absence as unacceptable. “We did not receive any correspondence from the board. I have spoken to the interim chairperson and he will be sending through correspondence and they will explain their circumstances to the committee on March 4. The board is the accounting authority and for us to be subjected to only speak to the department and management is inconsistent with the operating procedures of oversight and accountability. But the board will be explaining themselves and as far as we are concerned, their non-availability is not acceptable to us.” WATCH | Eskom board no show seen as a snub and contempt of Parliament:  Load shedding will continue Eskom reiterated to the committee that load shedding will continue for the next 18 months. The power utility warned that the possibility of load shedding on Wednesday has increased despite managing to keep the lights on since Sunday. It says it has lost additional generating units due to unplanned breakdowns.
