Former head of procurement at South African Airways Technical (SAAT), Nontsasa Memela will be re-examined by her legal representative on Wednesday at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. Memela has been grilled for the last three days about her involvement in awarding a R1.3 billion tender contract to US-based company AAR to supply aircraft components for SAAT. Her testimony has been defensive including accusations that the commissionâ€™s evidence leader advocate Kate Hofmeyr is hostile towards her. Memela accused Hofmeyr of driving a certain narrative towards her. Her lawyer Lindelwa Mbanjwa also accused Hofmeyr of being hostile towards her client. Memela also told Justice Zondo that she did not see anything wrong when she did not advise SAAT board members not to interact with AAR while the bidding process was still running. Memela also explained how she and other SAAT board members were treated to limousine rides and transported by private jet while on an AAR sponsored trip to Chicago. Related videos below:
