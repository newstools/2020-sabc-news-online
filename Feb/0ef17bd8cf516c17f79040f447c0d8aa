The Passenger Rail Agency, Prasa has disputed the Railway Safety Regulator’s findings on last week’s train crash that happened west of Johannesburg. The regulator conducted an investigation into the incident in Roodepoort which claimed one life and left several others injured It then directed Prasa to cease all operations of its long distance train, the Shosholoza Meyl. The Rail Safety Regulator says preliminary investigations have found that the Prasa train involved in the crash had not been countersigned by a Section Manager before it began its journey. The RSR says this was in contravention of the conditions of Prasa’s permit. The condition instructs that where a train is manually authorized, a Section Manager needs to authorize the process. In a press briefing on Friday, Prasa insisted it complied with all 10 safety conditions required by the Regulator. Until the two sides find common ground, the Shosholoza Meyl will not be in operation.
