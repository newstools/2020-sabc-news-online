The Democratic Alliance leader in Limpopo Jacques Smalle says the provincial unemployment figures are alarming and must be a concern to all spheres of government. The Statistics South Africa Quarterly Labour Force Survey revealed that Limpopo lost 35 000 jobs in the last quarter. Smalle says all structures of government must come up with sustainable solutions to save jobs. “We saw Limpopo province losing 35 000 jobs, bringing the annual total to 77 000 jobs being lost in Limpopo. We are also the fourth worst country when it comes to unemployment figures of 29.1% behind countries like Angola and Bosnia. And we must be concerned as municipalities and as a government so that we do not lose more jobs in the near future.”  SA unemployment rate remains unchanged South Africa’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the third of last year.
