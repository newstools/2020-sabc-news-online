The man accused of the brutal murder of Umlazi musician Lindokuhle Cele has abandoned his bail application. Cele was stabbed numerous times outside a shop in Umlazi in the south of Durban. The accused, Mvuyisi Noguda, has told the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court that he no longer wants to apply for bail. Members of the African National Congress Women’s League and people from the Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender community were protesting outside court. There are indications that there could have been a homophobic motive for the murder. The case has been remanded to the 30 March to make arrangements for Noguda to undergo psychiatric evaluation.  In the video below MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza condemns the murder of the musician:
