Former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, Dudu Myeni, has conceded that there might have been an error of judgement from the board on what is referred to as the Airbus Swap deal. Myeni is accused of trying to stop the deal from taking place so she could introduce a middle man. She is on trial in the High Court in Pretoria after the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) brought an application to declare her a delinquent director. The organisation blames her for the financial woes at the struggling airline. OUTA legal counsel, Carol Steinberg, says Myeni was grossly negligent and reckless as she kept on disregarding warnings on the consequences of amending the deal with air bus. Myeni says she might have understood things differently at the time. “It was my understanding at the time given the discussions that the board had with Airbus and the ongoing negotiations. Any error of judgement occurs in any normal business, there is nobody that would want to take a wrong decision deliberately,” says Myeni.
