The Electricity Crisis Movement has highlighted confusion at the manner in which Eskom bills its customers – saying they want clarity on charges to residents, businesses and government buildings. This as the movement begins protesting in parts of Gauteng to raise concerns over their fight with Eskom. The demonstrations were sparked after the cash strapped power utility cut power supply to Soweto customers in arrears – in an effort to recoup the R18-billion electricity bill owed to Eskom.  In this video below FullView looks at the electricity crisis in Soweto  Electricity Crisis Movement spokesperson, Rufus Tsoka, says pockets of protestors are emerging in areas including Alexandra, Eldorado Park and Thembisa. “This is how they try to break it down, the R18 billion – apparently, as I understand it – Eskom says the actual debt is R5 billion and R8 billion is interest to that gap. I am saying if you are going to be charging us that, then come back and tell us what exactly business owes, how much do residents owe and how much do the government buildings owe in Soweto? Then we can take it from there because even on the billing itself, estimates are being used. You hardly ever see people that come and check meters.” In the video Human Rights Foundation discuss issues between Eskom and Soweto  What Twitter users have to say about the #SowetoShutdown
