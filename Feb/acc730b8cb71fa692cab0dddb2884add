The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) management confirmed that another building at the Pietermaritzburg campus in the midlands has been set alight. The incident, which occurred late Monday night, follows the torching of an HIV Support Centre at the university’s Howard College campus in Durban earlier in the day. Students at UKZN are demanding that historic debt be written off. Last week, they allegedly petrol bombed a vehicle during a protest at the Edgewood Campus in Pinetown. The university’s Student Representative Council (SRC) has since distanced itself from these incidents. UKZN Director of Corporate Affairs Ashton Bodrick says, “Unfortunately, we feel that this now has become like criminality by some of the perpetrators and we want those responsible to be arrested.” “We are desperately looking for assistance from the police to apprehend and charge those responsible and make sure they face the law. We are doing everything in our power to ensure students get registered. We are going in a meeting and we will give a way forward to how we will handle other issues pertaining to what creates the problem,” says Bodrick.
