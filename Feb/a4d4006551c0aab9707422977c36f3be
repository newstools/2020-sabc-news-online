Wednesday marks four years since three miners were trapped underground due to the collapse of the Lily Mine near Barberton in Mpumalanga. Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyirenda were working inside a container when the mine collapsed. Rescue operations were halted a few days after the collapse when engineers declared the mine unsafe for human occupation. Former workers and family members of the three miners are gathered at the mine for the commemoration of the tragedy. Unions and the former owners of the mine are expected to address the gathering.
