The African Union and the United Nations say women can now get loans easily through a special fund dedicated to them. The African Womenâ€™s Development Fund says it will have up to 1 billion dollars for investment and will be rolled out through female fund managers who will, in turn, give loans to other women. The UN Economic Commission for Africa, Dr Vera Songwe says the target is to assist women to empower themselves. She spoke to SABC News Correspondent in Ethiopia, Coletta Wanjohi.
