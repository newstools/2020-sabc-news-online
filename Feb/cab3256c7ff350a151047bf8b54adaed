The African National Congress (ANC) has launched a new online membership system at Saul Tsotetsi Community Hall at Sebokeng in the Vaal, Gauteng. Addressing party members, Secretary General Ace Magashule said the party had embarked on the Ziveze Campaign to enable members to verify their membership status at branches. The party’s previous conferences have been marred by allegations of membership fraud, which resulted in the collapse of some of its regions. Magashule maintains that the new system is incorruptible. “The new and modernised online membership system is reliable, robust and not open to manipulation…the new membership system discourages gate-keeping and vote-buying, it promotes the unity, growth and vibrancy of the African National Congress.”
