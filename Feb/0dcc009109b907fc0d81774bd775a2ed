The cash-strapped Letsemeng Municipality in the Free State has until on Tuesday to pay its outstanding electricity bill. Last Wednesday, Eskom granted the municipality seven more days to settle its electricity bill or face disconnection. The extension follows the intervention of provincial treasury in assisting the municipality to pay the R5.4 million it owes Eskom. The municipality includes towns like Koffiefontein, Jacobsdal, Luckhof and Petrusburg. Eskom’s provincial customer services senior Manager Bibi Bedir says: “Should they not meet a payment arrangement that is agreed to us we will disconnect or interrupt supply from 6am until 8pm. In total Letsemeng owes us around R38 million.” On this video , Letsemeng municipality secures bailout to avert power blackout
