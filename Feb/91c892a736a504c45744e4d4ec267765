Thousands of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members led by party leader Julius Malema are crisscrossing the streets of Sandton, north of Johannesburg, as they make their way to Eskom’s headquarters in Sunninghill. The party is joined by the African Transformation Movement (ATM) leader Vuyolwethu Zungula and its Head of Policy and Strategy, Mzwanele Manyi. Traffic has come to a standstill in Sandton.  SABC News reporter Samkele Maseko is in the crowd:  Meanwhile, the rainy weather conditions in Johannesburg are not discouraging thousands of EFF members. Led in song by former EFF spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, they are carrying posters saying ” No to the privatisation of Eskom”. They are also calling for the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, to be fired by President Cyril Ramaphosa.  The march is expected to arrive at the Eskom headquarters at around 3pm this afternoon – where a memorandum of grievances will be handed to the management.
