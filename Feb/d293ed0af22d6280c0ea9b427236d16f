The City of Johannesburg has been inundated with calls from members of the public alerting them to localized flooding in certain areas across the city. This as the city is experiencing heavy rainfalls accompanied by strong winds and thunder storms on Saturday morning. Homes in low lying areas and those near river banks and vulnerable to flooding, have been most affected. SABC  Meteorologist, Mduduzi Mthembu says despite other provinces receiving more rainfall, Gauteng experienced flooding due to the high number of concrete buildings as they prevent water from penetrating into the soil. Watch for more:  The city’s poor stormwater drain system has also been attributed to the cause of the flooding.  Certain roads in Alexandra, Diepsloot, Soweto and the city centre are flooded and causing traffic delays.  Emergency Management Services spokesperson, Nana Radebe has urged road users to be vigilant on the roads and to keep a safe following distance.
