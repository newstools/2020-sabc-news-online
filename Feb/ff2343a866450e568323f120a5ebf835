President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged German and South African businesses to explore cooperation in the fields of clean and renewable energy. Ramaphosa chaired the South Africa-Germany Business Roundtable along with his German counterpart Angela Merkel in Pretoria on Thursday.  Germany plans to exit coal-powered energy in 2038. Ramaphosa says South Africa can learn a lot from German technology… “Our collaboration is critical as we strive to meet our obligations under the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, low carbon growth that is climate change resilient is a fundamental ternate of our Nation Dev Plan and we look forward to enhanced collaboration between local companies and their counterparts in Germany in rolling out appropriate tech in pursuits of this important objective.”
