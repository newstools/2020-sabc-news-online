Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says people assisted with an aircraft and drones in the search for missing Parktown Boys learner, Enock Mpianzi, whose body was found in a river at Inyathi Lodge near Brits in North West. He had apparently drowned during a “water activity”. Mpianzi and fellow learners were attending a school camp. Lesufi was speaking during a media conference at the school, north of the Joburg CBD. He says the family was devastated when the boy’s body was located and he was confirmed dead. “There was a light aircraft organised. I don’t know who organised it because it was not coming from the police. The owner of that aircraft started to search the fields with people that brought their own drones. We had to go brief the family and it was one of the most difficult exercises. Member of the family cried uncontrollably, devastated. We just have to provide all the relevant support and counselling.”
