President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for a speedy resolution to the tensions between the United States and Iran. He told his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani in a telephonic engagement, that South Africa wants to see a peaceful and just resolution that will restore peace in the region. South Africa’s principled view is that conflicts should be resolved through political dialogue rather than the use of force. Tensions between the two countries have been escalating since US President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike on Iraq last Friday in which Iran’s military commander, Qasem Soleimani was killed. President Ramaphosa took time out from his hectic schedule in Kimberley in the Northern Cape and called his Iranian counterpart. It’s where the ANC celebrates 108 years of existence. South Africa’s role as a Non-Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council and incoming Chair of the African Union sparked President Ramaphosa to intervene on the issue. In a statement, Ramaphosa says he hopes the conflict will soon be a thing of the past. Related video click below:
