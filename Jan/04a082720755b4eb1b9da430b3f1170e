Police Minister Bheki Cele says they will only take action once investigations have revealed who fired the fatal shot that killed Alexandra resident Samantha Radebe. He was responding to calls for the suspension of a police officer believed to be the one who fatally shot the woman. The 28-year-old Radebe was shot and killed allegedly in a crossfire between police and suspects on Wednesday in Alexandra. The incident sparked protests in the township. Cele says an investigation is being conducted to determine which of the three firearms that were used in the shooting killed Radebe. Cele met with community leaders at the Alexandra Police Station earlier on Sunday before visiting Radebe’s family. “We’re requesting 24 to 48 hours so that the investigation gives us the direction which we must take on that score, because it would be very difficult, we don’t know who dispatched the firearm on that particular day. I’m told that the witnesses say they saw but is an investigation that will tell us because we still have to act legally, but we have requested everybody involved to move with speed,” says Cele.
