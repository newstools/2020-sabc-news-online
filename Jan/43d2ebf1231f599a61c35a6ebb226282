The wage strike by members National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) continues on Wednesday at the Hisense Factory in Atlantis outside Cape Town. Workers are demanding a 15% wage increase and want back-dated bonuses. Numsa says striking members have been locked out of the factory since the strike began 13 days ago. They also protested outside the premises on Tuesday and were joined by the local community. There’s been no response from Hisense management. Numsa Regional Secretary in the Western Cape Vuyo Lufele says they will continue with their strike action and until their demands are met. Lufele says, “There will be a picket line and I am sure they are there already in their numbers, they will stand firm until their demands are met. Strike continues indefinitely and the community are fully supporting the strike. We feel they are making sure that as a community, the strike must be intensified and support those workers until this employer feels it’s necessary to come around the table.” The Hisense factory makes television sets and refrigerators amongst other things.
