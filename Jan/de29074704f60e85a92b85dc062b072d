President Cyril Ramaphosa has appealed to the country to be patient with Eskom as load shedding continues. He’s promised that the power problems facing the country will be resolved soon. The President was addressing residents of Roodepan, outside Kimberley, in his capacity as African National Congress (ANC) president. This was part of his visits to communities in the area ahead of the party’s 108th birthday celebrations. Some energy analysts have been calling for the government to allow independent power producers – including private homes – to be allowed to feed power from solar and other sources back into the national grid. President Ramaphosa says other power alternatives will also be considered, “We also have now agreed that Yes those companies that want to generate their own energy should be given permission to do so. Therefore there will be self-generation. We need to add capacity to what we’ve got in Eskom.” Stage 2 outages returned to South Africans on Saturday. @POWERALERT 1
