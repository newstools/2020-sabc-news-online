The South African Policing Union (Sapu) wants Police Minister Bheki Cele to ensure that police officers gain promotion at work in order to keep them motivated.   Sapu president Mpho Kwinika was speaking at the National Police Day celebrations on Sunday at the Gelvandale stadium in Port Elizabeth. “As the organisation we want to make a plea to the minister that he should make sure that things that motivate the police officers such as promotions are taken care of. These are things that would really make them to work and even perform beyond the performance we have seen in December,” explains Kwinika.
