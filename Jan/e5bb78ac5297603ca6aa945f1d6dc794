Transport minister, Fikile Mbalula says the festive season traffic statistics will be released towards the end of this month. He says the stats will give his department an indication of what more needs to be done to curb road fatalities. Minister Mbalula was speaking at the De Hoek plaza toll gate, near Heidelberg in Gauteng.  He says drinking and driving is still a major concern. “All the provinces we will sit down, evaluate the statistics; announce them. But equally what the statistics are telling us is what we will consolidate into law to ensure that we exert pressure to those who break the rule of law. Drink and driving, reckless driving, unroadworthy vehicles that lead to road fatalities, how do we deal with that.” ‘Harsher punishment for reckless drivers’ The Department of Transport has called on the National Prosecutor Authority (NPA) to impose harsher punishment for reckless and negligent drivers. Mbalula says many motorists also do not obey other rules of the road and even try to bribe traffic officials. “The behaviour of the drivers, drinking and driving obviously top – reckless driving, unroadworthy driving. And it is a crime to be found driving above the speed that you need to be driving in a defined zone,” says Mbalula. The holiday season is over and motorists are heading home after their holiday. Moderate to high traffic volumes are expected throughout the week with more people driving into the city. About 1000 vehicles per hour are passing through de Hoek Toll Plaza. Halve of these vehicles were stopped during a law enforcement blitz.
