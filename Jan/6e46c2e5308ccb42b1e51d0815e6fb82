The African National Congress (ANC) Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan needs to be supported by the whole National Executive Committee (NEC) in running state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The ANC held its NEC meeting over the weekend with SOEs and the expropriation of land without compensation topping the agenda. The party’s Lekgotla continues on Monday and will discuss government’s programme of action for this year. Mabe says Gordhan has called all members of the party to action. “He needs to be supported by the entirety of the national executive, even at the level of government. I think we should be supporting the Department of Public of Enterprises and not be swayed into any other narrative,” says Mabe. Various unions and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are threatening to disrupt President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address should the president fail to axe Minister Gordhan.
