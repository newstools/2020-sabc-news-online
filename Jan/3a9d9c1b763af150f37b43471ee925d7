African National Congress (ANC) deputy president David Mabuza says an internal shake-up of representatives and a change of policies will see an improvement in service delivery at the local government level. He was speaking during engagements with community members in Keimoes in the Northern Cape. Mabuza has been deployed to the area to drum up support for the party ahead of its 108th-anniversary celebrations to be held in Kimberley this weekend. He has promised government intervention in cases in which basic services are not being delivered. “So, it’s a society that got a lot of challenges, but given the right assistance, I think we can get out of these problems. There are a number of issues that this model will try and curb.”
