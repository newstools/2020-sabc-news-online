Eskom has denied that it has applied to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) for R1.8 billion to pay performance bonuses as reported in a Sunday newspaper. Eskom says the application included a provision for an annual bonus for the three year period, which is equivalent to a 13th cheque. Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae says no performance bonuses have been paid to employees in the past two years. “We have not applied to the energy regulator for any performance bonuses. In fact we haven’t paid performance bonuses in two years so those are the facts. In terms of our MYPD4 application for the three year period we do not include any application for performance bonuses. The application included a provision for an annual bonus for the three year period so this is equivalent to a 13th cheque which forms part of the Eskom basic conditions of service and cost to company.”
