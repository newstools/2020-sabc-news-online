Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba have visited the scene where an intern doctor was found killed inside her room at the doctors’ residence at the Mankweng Hospital outside Polokwane. The body of 24-year-old Shongile Nkhwashu was discovered on Sunday. A suspect known to Nkwashu has been arrested and will appear in court on Wednesday. Mkhize has met with other intern doctors at the hospital. One of the doctors has expressed shock. “I don’t feel safe anymore. You never know what’s gonna happen. Another thing is because it’s someone that I went to the same school with, and then we came here together. We were not that close, but you know when someone is your classmate. It kinda feels very close to me. It’s very painful and then yeah, with the allegations that she died in the hands of her boyfriend, it’s also something else, more especially with everything that has been happening in the country with gender-based violence.” Nkwashu’s death has again brought to the fore the scourge of femicide in South Africa, with the hashtag #RIPShongileNkwashu trending at number one on South African Twitter trends on Tuesday afternoon.
