A 16-year-old boy and a man who tried to help him have drowned in a stream in Bluegumbosch, Qwaqwa, in the Free State. The boy and his friends were swimming in a stream when he disappeared under the water. The stream is close to the river where seven-year-old Mosa Mbele drowned on Saturday. “A group of boys were playing and were swimming in the quarry and eventually, one of them drowned and other group went out and tried to get some help. There was a man in his thirties who was passing and he came to rescue the one who was drowning and he slipped into the quarry himself and drowned as well. Both bodies were retrieved and were taken to a government mortuary. We have opened inquest dockets so that we get to the bottom of what could have been the cause,” says Police Spokesperson Montantsi Makhele. Watch the video below for more on the story:
