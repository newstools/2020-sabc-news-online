Nine people have been critically injured in a collision between two vehicles on the R34 between Dundee and Vryheid near Blood River in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The crash comes after Sunday night’s tragic incident in which 10 people were killed when a minibus taxi and a light motor vehicle collided in the same area. “This follows yesterday’s (Sunday) collision involving a car and a minibus. This afternoon (Monday), there was a crash involving two light motor vehicles and nine people sustained critical injuries in this crash. Paramedics have treated the patients at the scene and have transported them to local health institutions for continued medical care. The exact cause of the crash is being investigated by the police,” says Emergency Medical Services Spokesperson, Robert Mckenzie.
