Political Analyst Sethulego Matebesi says President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s January 8 statement has failed to inspire public confidence. Ramaphosa delivered the statement at the Tafel Lager Stadium in Kimberley in the Northern Cape on Saturday. The statement, which outlines the African National Congress’ (ANC) programme of action for the year, was part of the governing party’s 108th anniversary celebrations. The crisis at Eskom overshadowed the celebrations after Deputy President David Mabuza said the power utility had misled Ramaphosa on load shedding and the subsequent resignation of Eskom board chairperson Jabu Mabuza on Friday. Matebesi says even the people that Ramaphosa was addressing did not seem to be interested in his speech. “I was very fortunate, I was in Kimberley yesterday and one thing that was surprising is that, even though it was thought that they would be too overblown, the majority of the people were outside. If that happened at the stadium, the question is that the message of the African National Congress delivered did not inspire hope unfortunately. I do not believe that it inspired hope,” says Matebesi. Watch a related video below:
