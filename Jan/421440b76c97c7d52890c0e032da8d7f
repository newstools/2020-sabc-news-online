Gauteng premier David Makhura says some schools in Gauteng are dysfunctional. Makhura was addressing parents at the newly built Noordgesig Primary School in Soweto, where he said drugs are destroying young people and this was spilling over into schools. The new primary school was opened after protests by the community in 2015 forced it to be closed due to health risks related to the old asbestos school. Makhura said the purpose of building the school is to bring facilities closer to communities. He said, “The schools are not functioning properly. Our children are getting destroyed by drugs, we have many problems… So in 2015 when I left here with councillor Parks Tau, I said to you it may take some time but we heard you.”
