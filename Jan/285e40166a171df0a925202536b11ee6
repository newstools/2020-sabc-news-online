The Federation of Governing Bodies of South Africa (FEDSAS) says load shedding will have a negative impact on schooling. Learning is expected to resume on Wednesday for the 2020 academic year. Load shedding was implemented again last week after it was suspended over the festive season. The Federation’s Paul Colditz says up to 2000 people can be negatively affected by load shedding at schools… “Obviously load shedding disrupts schools, particularly those with hostels if they do not have generators. Load shedding at a private house with 4 or 5 people that are affected. It can be 1500 to 2000 people at a school negatively affected by load shedding and the suddenly disrupts the education process.” Meanwhile, Eskom says it expects no load shedding on Monday as the power system is showing some improvement after it was forced to implement blackouts. The power utility says additional capacity was brought online from the return of generation units that tripped earlier and lower demand over the weekend which have allowed it to replenish its emergency reserves.
