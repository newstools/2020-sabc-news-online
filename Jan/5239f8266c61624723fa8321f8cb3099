The Automobile Association says the 2019-2020 festive season road fatality statistics should be treated with caution. One-thousand-617 fatalities occurred from 1390 crashes. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said when releasing the figures on Thursday that the number of road fatalities and injuries over the past festive season had dropped by 10% compared to the previous year. The majority of road users who died were pedestrians with 40 %, passengers 34 %, drivers 25 % and 1% cyclists. “So I think our first concern will be these preliminary numbers. Look at the preliminary figures that were briefly announced last year, was 1612. It has increased by 177 by the final count. So the number we got now is 1789. And today we’ve got a number of 1617 deaths and this is a preliminary figure. We don’t know how is that going to jump when the final count is audited when we get these figures next year,” says Automobile Association’s spokesperson Layton Baird.
