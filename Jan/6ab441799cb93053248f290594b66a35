The Gauteng Education Department has changed its policy on school outings following the death of 13- year-old Enock Mpianzi. The Parktown Boys’ High School learner drowned last week in the Crocodile River in Brits while attending a Grade 8 orientation camp at the Nyati Bush campsite in North West. Lesufi says schools are now expected to seek authorisation from the department if learners are to participate in physical activities. “School outings that have boat activities must be authorised at head office where we check their proper safety measures in place. But remember the consent forms are a product of the parents themselves not the department. It is parents at the schools that formulate the consent forms so if parents are not happy with consent forms; they must convene SGB (School Governing Body) meetings and amend or change them.  It is the power of the department, it is the power of the SGB to formulate and change those consent forms.” Click below for more on the story:
