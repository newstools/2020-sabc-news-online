Eskom Chief Operations Officer Jan Oberholzer says the power generation is slowly picking up after load shedding was implemented over the weekend. Eskom said no load shedding is expected for Monday after it was suspended at 11pm on Sunday night. Oberholzer says the power utility has managed to conserve diesel at their open cycle gas turbine generators. “I think what is extremely positive. This morning we successfully returned Koeberg unit 1 that was out on refuelling and general overhaul successfully this morning. So the 920 megawatts will be available towards the end of the week,” says Oberholzer. He added saying, “So we will ramp up slowly to get to that, so that was a significant milestone as well.”
