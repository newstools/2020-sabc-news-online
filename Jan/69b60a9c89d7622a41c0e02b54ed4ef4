The Freedom Front Plus says it disagrees with GunFree South Africa that the South African Police should allow for the submission of unwanted or illegal firearms on an anonymous basis to encourage more people to come forward. The FF-Plus says this will benefit the criminals and destroy evidence of crimes that were committed. The amnesty on unwanted or illegal firearms is granted currently only after ballistic tests show that they were not used in criminal activities. FF-Plus Leader Pieter Groenewald says: “What I say is as far as GunFree South Africa is concerned to say that people should be able to hand in their firearms on an anonymous basis, I say that will enhance crime in South Africa because criminals will  use that situation to get rid of the evidence.” “If they don’t know the firearms, from whom it was handed in, then it is a very good opportunity to get rid of evidence and therefore I say that it will enhance crime in South Africa.”
