Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to act immediately to help boost economic growth. The call comes ahead of the organisation’s Business Economic Indaba starting on Tuesday. Ramaphosa is expected to be a guest at the indaba on Tuesday. South Africa is facing slowing economic growth which can be attributed partly to problems at power utility Eskom. BUSA president, Sipho Pityana, says the indaba will give them an opportunity to engage with government on the economy. “It gives us an opportunity to engage with government on what urgently needs to be done to reposition the economy. That conversation is critical because it happens right in the build-up to what the president might be saying around the State of the Nation Address and what the minister of finance will be saying around budget.” Pityana says they believe that the president can make a change in the economy. “The president has enormous powers in the constitution and the authority to take critical decisions that can shift the envelope.” FOR MORE, LISTEN TO SIPHO PITYANA’S INTERVIEW ON SAFM’S SUNRISE BELOW: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/800252">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
