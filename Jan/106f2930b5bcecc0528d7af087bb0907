The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation says calls for Eskom to be placed under the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy is an attack on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s leadership and weakens his arsenal in the fight against state capture and corruption.  This follows calls by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and others, for Ramaphosa to fire Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. There are also reports that there has been calls for SOEs to go to various other government departments at the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) meeting, currently underway in Pretoria. Executive director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Neeshan Balton, says they have also called on Ramaphosa and the ANC not to relent to threats by the EFF to disrupt next month’s State of the Nation Address if Gordhan remains in office. “The attack really, is seen as an attack on the President given that he has placed Minister Gordhan in that position and has given him a particular mandate to execute. Minister Gordhan has been one of the key backers of Ramaphosa and therefore getting rid of him in our and the view of the veterans, weakens the President. Substantially, the overall fight against state capture and corruption in this country,” says Balton.
