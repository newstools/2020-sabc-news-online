Details about how Eskom was captured are expected to be revealed at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Thursday when the power utility’s former chairperson, Zola Tsotsi takes the stand.  In 2017, Tsotsi told Parliament’s Public Enterprises Committee inquiry into Eskom how he was forced to shed top executives at the parastatal who did not toe the line. He also told that inquiry how one of the Gupta brothers threatened to have him fired and find someone else for the job because he was not assisting them. The former chairperson is expected to shed more light on how and when Eskom was captured.  Eskom was amongst one of the State Owned Entities and the centre stage for corruption and state capture. Tsotsi in his previous testimonies has claimed that he was merely taking orders from above and that he was a victim of circumstances. The former chairperson is likely to give damming details of the extent of the rot at the power utility-and how involved the Gupta brothers were. Meanwhile, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture deputy chief Justice Raymond Zondo is expected to brief the media on Thursday on the commission’s application to extend its work until the end of the year. The commission lodged an application at the High Court in Pretoria at the end of last year for an order to extend it to 31 December this year. It was expected to finalise its hearings at the end of next month. The commission was established by former President Jacob Zuma following a High Court ruling which ordered him to comply with the Public Protector’s remedial action. Click below for more:
