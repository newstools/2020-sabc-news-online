Cape Town police say the possibility of more arrests in connection to the robbery of 11 tourists in Khayelitsha cannot be ruled out. A 26-year-old man has been arrested and two suspects have been taken in for questioning regarding the incident. The tourists, from the USA and Russia, were visiting a school in the area with a local tour guide when five armed men robbed them of their valuables. Police spokesperson, Novella Potelwa says “The arrested suspect is expected to appear in court on Monday on a robbery charge. As the investigation unfolds, the possibility of more arrests being effected cannot be ruled out.” Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato, has condemned the robbery.  “Mayor Plato rejects the selfish nature of this act as each instance of crime has a negative impact on job creation opportunities and limits communities who need employment. The South African Police Service remains the primary law enforcement body but we all need to play our part to keep residents and visitors safe. Mayor Plato calls on SAPS to arrest those responsible as soon as possible,” says Mayoral spokesperson, Lyndon Khan.
