The future looks bleak for over 1000 employees of Prasa’s bus company Autopax which operates Translux and City to City buses. They’ve been paid only half of their salaries this month as the company has fallen deep into financial trouble. A constant fixture on South Africa’s roads for many years but now the future is uncertain. Lately, the company has been struggling to pay salaries on time, culminating in the current predicament. The financial situation is so bad the company is unable to tell the workers when the other half of their salaries will be paid. Workers say it all comes as no surprise as mismanagement and corruption is rife at the state company. To make matters worse, the parent company Prasa itself is no different. It was recently placed under administration by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula who described it as a broken organisation. Management is due to meet with the unions SATAWU and NUMSA to discuss the way forward. Related video click below:
