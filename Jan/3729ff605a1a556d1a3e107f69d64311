City Power says power has been fully restored to several areas in Johannesburg. The areas were left without power after Fordsburg substation tripped on Saturday morning. The Johannesburg Central, Braamfontein, Newtown, Mayfair, Kibler Park, Alvida, Devland, Olifantsvlei, Eldoradopark, Brixton and Westdene are some of the suburbs that were affected by the power outages. In a tweet, City Power has emphasised that the power cuts were not due to load shedding â€“ saying it will leave updates on its social media pages on further power disruptions.
