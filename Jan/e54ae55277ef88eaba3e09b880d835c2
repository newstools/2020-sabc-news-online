The Department of Social Development has opened its Gender-Based Violence Command Centre (GBVCC) to matriculants who may be anxious about their examination results. The matric class of 2019 will receive their results on Wednesday and reports of depression and suicide tend to be on the increase during this time. The department urges matriculants and their parents to make use of the Command Centre to receive counselling and support from trained social workers. It also appeals to parents to look out for any signs of depression from their children and seek help early. Deaf callers can also interact with the centre using Skype. They will need to add ‘HELPMEGBV’ to their contacts and a social worker will accept the invite and call them back. Calls to the Command Centre are free and the number is 0800 428 428. Callers can also request a social worker from the centre to contact them by dialling *120*7867# (free) from any cell phone. The Social Development Department has meanwhile also wished well all the 596 720 social grants beneficiaries who sat down for their matric examinations last year. “The Department wishes to remind the grant beneficiaries who will pass and be accepted at institutions of higher learning that they will no longer be means tested by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) when they apply for financial assistance,” it says in a statement. The department is encouraging those would fail their matric exams to take advantage of Basic Education Department’s Second Chance Matric Support Programme. “This is available to support learners who will be wishing to use the second opportunity to sit for exams. We encourage learners to register at their schools or district offices.”
