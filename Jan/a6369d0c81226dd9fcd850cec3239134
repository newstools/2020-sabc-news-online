South African entrepreneur and property developer Dr Richard Maponya’s memorial service has been moved to Friday. It was supposed to take place on Wednesday at the Rosebank Union Church in Sandton, north of Johannesburg. Family spokesperson Mandla Sibeko says the business mogul will be laid to rest on Tuesday, the 14th of January. The exact details and location of the funeral service is expected to be announced soon. Dr Maponya died in hospital on Monday after a short illness at the age of 99. He has been hailed as a pioneering entrepreneur, who defied apartheid’s oppressive laws to establish and grow his businesses. The business icon started small grocery stores in Soweto in the early 1950s, which led to various businesses including a butchery, a car dealership and filling station. His R65 million Maponya Mall in Soweto is one of the achievements, some believe, he will be best remembered for. Maponya’s career highlights include being a trustee of The Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund as well as the Founder and first President of the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce (Nafcoc).
