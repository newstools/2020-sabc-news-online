The absence of the Gupta brothers as witnesses at the State Capture Inquiry does not jeopardize the process. That’s according to Commission Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. He was briefing the media on the extension of the lifespan of the commission. Zondo said this would be the final year of the commission. Responding to media questions, Zondo said the commission’s work was unaffected by the absence of the Guptas. “We would have preferred to have their evidence. They chose that they are not going to give us their side of the story and, just because they are not going to give us their side of the story, we will not stop this important work. We’ll hear from everybody and make findings.” WATCH THE STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY MEDIA BRIEFING BELOW:
