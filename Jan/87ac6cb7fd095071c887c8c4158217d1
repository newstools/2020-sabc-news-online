Several events have been organised to mark the African National Congress’ (ANC) 108th anniversary in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of the ANC’s first Secretary-General Sol Plaatjie. He will do the same at struggle veteran Mittah Seperepere’s graveside, before cutting the cake at the Galeshewe Multi-Purpose Centre to mark the governing party’s 108th birthday. Walkabouts, town hall meetings and sectional engagements are some of the activities planned for the week to mark the anniversary. Ramaphosa will deliver the party’s annual January 8 statement on Saturday, which ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has said will be about reviving the hopes of South Africans who are unemployed and living in poverty.
