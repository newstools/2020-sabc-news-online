The African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Tshwane have submitted a petition for a special council meeting on Wednesday where they will bring several motions of no confidence in the leadership of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the city. This after the Speaker and Executive Mayor were removed in a special council meeting in 2019. The High Court in Pretoria later suspended the resolutions taken at the specific council meeting after the DA took the matter to court. ANC leader in Tshwane Kgosi Maepa says the court ruling does not prevent them from continuing with council business. A total of 114 councillors from the ANC and the EFF signed the petition. Maepa says the Speaker must call the meeting according to the rules and regulations of the council. Watch the video below for related news:
