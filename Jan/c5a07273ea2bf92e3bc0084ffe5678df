Condolences are pouring in after the passing of businessman Richard Maponya. Maponya passed away this morning after a short illness at the age of 99. Trade union Cosatu has called on all South Africans to copy his life and work hard to change their lives. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Phamla says Maponya triumphed during hard times and defied apartheid. “At the time when young people are discouraged and seated at home and unemployed because of the difficult circumstances, we hope that they will take inspiration from him and realise that even in dark circumstances, in difficult situations you can triumph and succeed only if you work hard and you are dedicated because that’s what Ntate Maponya did.” Meanwhile Former City of Joburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba says he is devastated by the passing of Maponya. Mashaba who is a businessman himself, says Maponya has contributed immensely to the person he is today. He says his passing is a great loss to the black community. “We are going remember him for being a shining example to us when times were hard, when times were dark in our country. As black youth, it is possible to go into business against all odds. That is something that will live with some of us forever. We will always remember him for the role he has played indirectly because he was not aware of people like us as we were growing up, but we were watching him and did everything possible to follow on his footsteps.” Click related video below:
