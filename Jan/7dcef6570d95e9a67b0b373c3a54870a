The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says its teams, that have been deployed to foreign countries, are not in danger of being exposed to the deadly coronavirus. The outbreak started in China, where it has claimed more than 130 lives. Major-General Michiel de Goede says forces that are on missions are safe. “Anything currently related to the virus, those must be diverted, not to the Department of Defence, but to the Health Department. However, the SANDF and the South African Health services have proven themselves in the north east of the DRC to ensure that our deployed forces there are not introduced to the deadly Ebola virus.” While there have been confirmations of infection in several countries, there’s been no confirmed cases in Africa. In Sudan, however, two people are undergoing medical checks following suspicions they might be infected. The pair had been in the region of the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.
