The 12 National Defence Force members accused of stealing 19 R4 assault rifles from the SANDFâ€˜s Tek Base in Lyttelton have been released from custody until they appear again in court on 10 March 2020. The men applied for bail in the Military Court sitting in Thaba Tshwane, Pretoria, late in December. They were released on Friday after their matter was postponed earlier to allow for investigations to continue without interference from the accused. SANDF spokesperson, Sphiwe Dlamini explains that the accused were released from custody, rather than on bail. Dlamini says this is due to the internal court processes that the accused are being taken through. The 19 semi-automatic R4 rifles have not been recovered. The case is expected to resume on March 10.
