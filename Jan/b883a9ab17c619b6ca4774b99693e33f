In his weekly letter, President Cyril Ramaphosa has spoken of the pressing need to build a capable state. The President says such a state starts with officials and managers who possess the right skills. He says government will end the practice of poorly qualified individuals being parachuted into positions of authority through political patronage. He has warned that officials will suffer consequences if they do not do their jobs. President Cyril Ramaphosa says several glaring instances of service delivery failures relate to some areas having a small revenue base but also elected officials and public servants have neglected their responsibilities. As part of building a capable state, state owned enterprises need to fulfil their mandates effectively and priority will be given to appointing experienced and qualified boards and managers and providing them with a clear mandate to execute. Ramaphosa has also urged citizens to participate and advise government on the standards of public services in communities.
