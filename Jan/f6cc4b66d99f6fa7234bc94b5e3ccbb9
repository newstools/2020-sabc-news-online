The SABC says it has not been served with court papers relating to a R14 million defamation case involving a former employee. Former Head of Legal at the public broadcaster, Nompumelelo Phasha, allegedly filed a case in the Johannesburg High Court two weeks ago arguing that SABC CEO, Madoda Mxakwe and Head of News, Phathiswa Magopeni defamed her in several interviews with the corporation. Phasha alleges that a statement issued last year about her dismissal stated that she was facing charges of misconduct and conflict of interest after she failed to recuse herself from a procurement process that involved a relative. The statement also said Phasha was also allegedly involved in a fraudulent trade exchange deal amounting to R8 million. Reports say she has asked the court that the pair pay from their own pockets as the statement was wrongful, malicious and unlawful and has tarnished her reputation. SABC spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo, “The SABC can confirm that it has not received any court papers relating to a defamation case, therefore we are unable to make any further comment.”
