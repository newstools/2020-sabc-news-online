The build-up of the African National Congress (ANC) activities across all five regions of the Northern Cape has gained momentum. Party president Cyril Ramaphosa and several ANC National Executive Committee members have been traversing the province to encourage party members and the general public to attend the ANC 108th anniversary celebrations.  The ANC leadership says it’s all systems go for the hosting of the party’s 108th anniversary on Saturday. For the past few days, the top six officials and other NEC members conducted door-to-door visits, walkabouts and community meetings mobilising people to attend the historic event. So far President Cyril Ramaphosa is confident their message has found resonance within communities. Organisers are expecting at least 25 000 people to attend the rally with 600 journalists having shown interest to cover the event. Click on the video below:
