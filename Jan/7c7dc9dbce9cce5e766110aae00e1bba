Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille says she is concerned about continued death threats against the National Administrator that is deployed to the corruption-plagued North-West department, as a national intervention. Over 150 contracts are under review and have been handed over to the Special Investigative Unit, while many others are with the Hawks. The administrator has confirmed that he was threatened with guns at the offices and a case was opened. De Lille is visiting the province to assess progress in her intervention. “There will be push back because people want to loot and steal but we have to just bite the bullet and we have to make sure we continue to clean up government. I am worried about him, he has a clear track record and we just have to give him the necessary protection,” says De Lille.
