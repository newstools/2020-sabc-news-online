The Director for African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. John Nkengasong says the World Health Organisation (WHO) is helping the continent to take precautions. “We are preparing as quickly as possible in a coordinated fashion with the World Health Organisation. We just conducted a meeting with all member states from the AU to check with them how prepared they are. We continue to provide them support in areas of laboratory testing, in the areas of enhanced airport screening and monitoring and also in the areas of infection, prevention and infection control especially the hospitals.” Watch video below:
