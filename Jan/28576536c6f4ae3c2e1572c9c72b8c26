Autopax employees will receive the rest of their salaries from Tuesday. Workers union Numsa says this was agreed on at their meeting with the organisation’s management. Autopax employees including translux and City to City drivers were paid half salaries this month following a financial crisis at the company. The company is a subsidiary of the embattled Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa which is under administration. Numsa says it’s concerned that Autopax will not be able to resolve their financial trouble in the near future. In a statement, the union says management repeated the same promises they made last year. It says the situation at Autopax has caused anxiety among employees because this is not the first time salaries have been delayed. The union has called on the Transport ministry to pay attention to the issues of mismanagement and corruption their members have raised.
