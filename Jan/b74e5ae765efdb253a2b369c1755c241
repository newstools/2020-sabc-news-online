The trial of a group of people accused of the murder of 28-year-old Thoriso Themane is expected to start on Monday in the High Court in Polokwane in Limpopo. Two men and nine teenagers aged between 13 and 17 were arrested for the murder. The adult suspects are 36-year-old Chuene Maleka and 37-year-old Alfred Mothapo. The group, which included school children, attacked Themane in Polokwane on 23 February 2019. His mother Maria Themane says they do not want the trial to drag on. “We are always anxious every time we have to go to court. But we understand that legal processes must be followed. We wish the case could be concluded quickly because it has been long. We will not find closure for as long as the case continues.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
