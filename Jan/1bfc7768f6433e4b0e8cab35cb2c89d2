Some parts of Johannesburg are without power. City Power has attributed the power outages in central Johannesburg to a trip in the Fordsburg substation. In a tweet, City Power says the power cut includes areas around Johannesburg Central, Braamfontein, Newtown, Mayfair, Kibler Park, Alvida, Devland, Olifantsvlei, Eldoradopark, Brixton, Westdene, among others. It says technicians have been dispatched to work on power restorations.
