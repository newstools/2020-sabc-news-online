The former speaker of the City of Johannesburg, Councillor Vasco da Gama says Gauteng Cooperative Governance MEC, Lebogang Maile has been on the city’s case since he came in last year. This after Maile rescinded da Gama and Tshwane’s current speaker, Katlego Mathebe suspension saying he will provide reasons for his decision on Tuesday.  Last week, Mathebe and da Gama were placed on a six-months and three-months suspension without pay, respectively, for allegedly breaching the code of conduct for Councillors. Da Gama says legal action should be taken against Maile for labeling him and Mathebe constitutional delinquents. Speaking on Morning Live he says: “The reasons are quite clear, that the MEC was either wrongly advised by his legal advisers, or he was playing politics and trying to play a power game to ensure that both Tshwane and Johannesburg fail.” He says there is no way that Maile can prove that I am a constitutional delinquent. “He doesn’t understand the constitution and that is why he took the action that he took. That is why it is important to set an example. You cannot override local government,” says da Gama.  Mathebe added that the is nothing within the law that constituted their suspension. She says: “Maile misinterpreted the law and he failed to give any provision of the law as to why he is suspending us.” “The is nothing within the law that empowers him to do this” Meanwhile, Maile has said will not deal with the merits or demerits of rescinding their suspensions on Monday but will address a media briefing on Tuesday in Johannesburg.
