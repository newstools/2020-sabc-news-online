Former director-general in the Presidency the Reverend Frank Chikane, who was also detained at the notorious John Voster Square Police Station is expected to testify at the inquest of anti-apartheid activist Dr Neil Aggett on Thursday. On Wednesday, former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan concluded her testimony in which she explained how she attempted to commit suicide after being severely assaulted during an intensive interrogation at John Voster in 1981. Hogan testified at the inquest in the High Court in Johannesburg. Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the station in Johannesburg on February 5, 1982. Aggett’s family disputes the claim of the apartheid security branch that he committed suicide. Hogan says she hopes justice will be served. “The reopening of the inquest is very painful for virtually everyone sitting here, but it’s timely and I have just spoke of the terrors that I faced, (that) many people faced. I just want thank everyone who was involved. Neil and everyone who died in detention under these terrible circumstances need to be heard and have justice done,” explains Hogan.
