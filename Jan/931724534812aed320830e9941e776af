City of Johannesburg Mayor, Geoff Makhubo has joined acting Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi in condemning the shooting incidents that marred New Year’s celebrations. In Melville, at around one am, at least two people were killed and six were wounded, two critically, in a drive by shooting. The shooting appears to have followed an altercation. Police are searching for the suspects. Around two hours later 11 people were wounded in a shooting at Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown in the Johannesburg CBD. Police have yet to released details on the exact circumstances around the shootings. Acting Mayoral Spokesperson, Nkhensani Makhobela says: “They are recovering. Fortunately, they were not seriously injured. However, we continue as a City to condemn such barbaric acts. It’s currently under investigation and the SAPS and JMPD are working around the clock to really get to the bottom of this issue. What we have gathered so far is that it did not happen from the Mary Fitzgerald Square itself. The shots seem to have come from the M1 from the highway instead.”
