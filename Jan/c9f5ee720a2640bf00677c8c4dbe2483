Medical experts at Stellenbosch University say there’s no need to panic following the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. Head of Virology at the Faculty of Medicine Professor Wolfgang Preiser says researchers in China have already established that the virus spreads easily, but is not as deadly as the SARS outbreak in 2013. Preiser says they are prepared to treat and manage patients in South Africa. “Luckily here in South Africa we are well prepared. Of course there is no absolute guarantee; I mean cases I suppose will arrive at some stage, but we are quite well prepared to find them early, to identify them, to test them and if necessary to nurse and to care for them under isolation so that the infection is not transmitted any further.” Watch video below for more:  Meanwhile, the government of Botswana has reported its first suspected case of the coronavirus.
