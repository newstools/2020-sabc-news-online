Eskom says no load shedding is expected on Saturday despite a constrained and vulnerable power system. The power utility says it is experiencing high levels of breakdowns at its generating plant. Eskom teams are working around the clock to ensure that the risk of load shedding is minimised as South Africans return to work from Monday. The power utility says officials are working on returning some generating units to service during this weekend, including Koeberg Unit 1, which will start feeding into the grid. Emergency reserves will be used to supplement capacity if necessary. On Friday, the power utility warned South Africans of a high load shedding risk for next week because of unplanned breakdowns and increased demand for electricity as most South Africans are expected to return to work after the festive season. Eskom Deputy Spokesperson Dikatso Mothae confirmed that breakdowns had reached levels of above 9 500 megawatts on Friday. The country last experienced load shedding before the festive holidays,Â  when the power utility implemented stage four and for the first time stage six load shedding. Watch related video below:
