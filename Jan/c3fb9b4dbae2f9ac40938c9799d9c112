Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago says team South Africa plans to demonstrate to potential investors what progress government has made to implement structural reforms. He was speaking at the World Economic Forum which started in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. Some of those attending are using the forum to seek private investment and make business deals. Kganyago says positive structural reforms matter to potential investors.  “South Africa has got excellent tourism assets inspite of our previous efforts in which we made it difficult for tourists to come to South Africa. We have made it easier for tourists to come to South Africa through relaxing the visa regulations. We have seen government talking about this and it is part of the structural reform programmes and the work that has been done from the treasury side small as they might look like – actually would raise the potential of South Africa’s economy,” says Kganyago.
