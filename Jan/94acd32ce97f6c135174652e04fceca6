The University of Johannesburg has reduced the registration fees for new applicants in attempts to accommodate deserving students. Spokesperson Kinta Burger says not all students receive funding from government and the university has taken a decision to help those who are in need. In terms of space availability – the university will only take 10 500 new applicants. Burger says, “The students need only to pay the first portion of their registration, an administration fee at UJ around about R3 800 for the first payment. Now students that get Nsfas state funding and high percentage do get that they don’t pay anything. So for many of the students, it is a huge relief that if you don’t have Nsfas, some parents will struggle to get that together.”
