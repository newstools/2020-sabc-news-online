Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize will on Friday address South Africans on the coronavirus outbreak, which has been declared a global health emergency. The media briefing will be held in Johannesburg at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD). It comes hours after the World Health Organisation (WHO) reversed its decision to hold back acknowledging that the virus represents a risk beyond China.  WHO confirmed 7 736 infections in China alone and 98 cases in 18 countries outside that country. These include eight cases of human-to-human transmission in the United States, Germany, Vietnam and Japan. Most of those infected are people who have travelled from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began in December 2019. Watch related video below:  There are at least 35 South Africans known to be in that city. But there have been no reports of any of them being infected. Coronavirus has claimed 170 lives so far. On Wednesday, Minister Mkhize assured South Africans that the country is adequately prepared to deal with the deadly disease. Every province in the country has a designated hospital to deal with the virus, with Gauteng allocated three health facilities. See map below for designated hospitals:   Special screening measures have been put in place at the OR Tambo International Airport for travellers flying in from China.
