ANC MP and former Northwest Premier Supra Mahumapelo has vowed that the party will not support the DA’s motion to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane from office. Mahumapelo says the governing party will use its majority in Parliament to block Mkhwebane’s axing. He was speaking outside the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court, where he had went to support fellow MP Bongani Bongo, who is facing a corruption charge. Mahumapelo says the ANC has not taken a decision that Mkhwebane be removed and is adamant that she’s staying put. National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise recently approved a Democratic Alliance (DA) motion to initiate proceedings for the removal of the Public Protector. The DA believes Mkhwebane is incompetent and unfit for office. But Mahumapelo disagrees, saying the Public Protector is in fact doing a sterling job. “Very soon to release what some of us have done as an analysis about the performance of the office of the Public Protector; factual reasons why the Public Protector cannot go. Because she has done very well…” The former North West Premier says the fact that the Constitutional Court found advocate Mkhwebane to have been dishonest doesn’t mean she must be shown the door.  “It doesn’t matter…it is part of law in the Republic. You being found guilty doesn’t result in you having to be necessarily remove from your position.”
