Acting Gauteng premier and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi will on Friday afternoon visit Tokelo Secondary school in Evaton on the Vaal which was gutted by fire.  Several classrooms and learner material were destroyed in the blaze in the early hours of Thursday morning.  The loss is estimated at around R4-million. This comes in just less than two weeks before schools open for the new academic year. The Education Department says arson is to blame for the fire. Spokesperson Steve Mabona says the MEC will assess the extent of the damage to the school before meeting the residents. “So we wish to call upon the members of the community who might have witnessed or who might know something about this incident to interact with the police so that they can apprehend the suspects. It is quite disappointing to find ourselves in this situation.”  Click on the video below:
