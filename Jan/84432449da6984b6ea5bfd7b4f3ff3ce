Several events are organised on Wednesday to mark the African National Congress (ANC)’s 108th anniversary in Kimberley. President President Cyril Ramaphosa leads a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of the ANC’s first Secretary-General Sol Plaatjie and at the graveside of struggle veteran Mittah Seperepere before cutting the cake at the Galeshewe Multi-Purpose Centre at noon to mark the party’s birthday. A representative from Solomon Plaatje has thanked the government for being patient with them during the preparations of the wreath-laying at his grave. There has been a feud between the two Plaatje family factions – with one faction accusing the provincial government of not involving them during the preparations of the wreath-laying. The faction went as far as removing what they referred to as a ‘cage’ that was erected by the government ahead of Wednesday’s event. The family representative, Obakeng Plaatje who spoke just after President Ramaphosa laid a wreath on the grave says they are happy for the honour of their father. “With all the drama that has happened amongst the family, we did not give up. We stood together. We made the promise that the Plaatje family will be united and we will afford the ANC the opportunity to respect our father and we will all join them in doing so. Solomon Plaatje does not belong to us, he is a world icon and the father of the ANC,” says Plaatje.  Walkabouts, town hall meetings and sectional engagements are some of the activities planned for the week to mark the anniversary. Ramaphosa will deliver the party’s annual January 8 Statement on Saturday, which ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has said will be about reviving the hopes of South Africans who are unemployed and living in poverty.
