Police minister Bheki Cele says limiting the number of firearms per person and curbing the issuing of firearm licences are some of the amendments government will propose to the Firearms Act. Cele was addressing the media at the Linden Police station, north of Johannesburg, where he gave an update on the Firearm Amnesty on Tuesday.   An arms dealer on Tuesday handed in close to 300 guns and about 3 000 rounds of ammunition at the Linden police station. Over 2 000 guns and more than 30 000 rounds of ammunition have been surrendered in less than 50 days.   Cele says major changes to the Firearms Act are being proposed. “One thing that we are trying to put there is that individuals should not have firearms. But it will be wonderful to have a country where individuals are not issued firearms. That is linked with the safety of the citizens which means that the government especially the agencies like police and others will have to pull up their socks … if people are not armed but must be safe,” explains the minister.
