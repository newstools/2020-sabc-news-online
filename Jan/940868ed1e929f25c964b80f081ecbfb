The National Teachers Union (NATU) has commended the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education for the security measures that are in place at the Buhlebethu Primary School in Inanda Newtown north of Durban. Four robbers who shot a teacher and robbed others have been positively identified through CCTV footage at the school. It is believed that a group of seven people gained access to the premises posing as parents who wanted to enrol a learner at the school. NATU president Allan Thompson says the society has a responsibility to secure schools. “This is very disappointing situation because we believe that schools are the institutions that are supposed to be safe, because that is where the future of the country is. But we are grateful also that in this whole situation the school is having other devices that are assisting to improve the security. I’m talking about the cameras that are in school. I’m talking about the security that is in school hence we are getting a report again that the police were able to arrest some of the perpetrators.  This should send a strong message to the department of education. That’s another thing that needs to be considered by the department, is to have the metal detectors in each and every school gate so that we are able to tell if a person is coming inside the school environment with any form of a weapon.” Teaching and learning has been suspended at the school until Monday to provide psychological assistance to traumatised learners.
