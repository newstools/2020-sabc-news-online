The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has heard about corruption in the KwaZulu-Natal Police Services through the testimony of retired Colonel Johannes van Loggerenberg. At the centre of his testimony is how politically-connected businessman Toshen Panday evaded prosecution despite strong evidence of fraud and corruption between him and supply management officials at the SAPS. Van Loggerenberg told the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that Panday was accused of charging inflated prices for police accommodation as well as goods and services during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Then KZN Police Commissioner Mmamonyane Ngobeni allegedly ordered the dropping of charges against Panday amidst allegations that the businessman paid about R30 000 for her husband’s birthday. In 2013, bribery charges were withdrawn against Panday by the National Prosecution’s Authority Advocate Moipone Noko. Click video below for more:
