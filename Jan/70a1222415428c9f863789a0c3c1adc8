Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, has called on the Elsburg community, east of Johannesburg, to assist with any information on the murder of a 15-year-old girl, Laticia Jansen, in Germiston. The Grade 9 learner, from Graceland Education Centre, reportedly went missing last Wednesday before her body was found on Friday in an open veld in Elsburg. Jansen’s body was found stabbed, raped and burnt. Lesufi was speaking after visiting the Jansen family. He labelled the rape and murder as barbaric. “We can’t have a barbaric act like this and the community is business as usual. We are coming here for a community meeting tomorrow and we have to find a way to deal with this situation. The reality is that sometimes we protect vultures because they are soft targets. The reality is that there is a monster that has killed this child and that monster lives amongst us. If someone has the determination to rape, kill and burn, what kind of safety plan will stop that? This person is barbaric.” Lesufi, has given Graceland Education Centre in 2PM on Monday to provide reasons why they did not assist the family of Jansen, after being notified that the Grade 9 learner was missing. He says heads will roll if he does not get answers. “I started at the school, no one could give me answers about why the learner was not at school on Wednesday to Friday and the school is not aware. The parent comes there to say ‘I have a missing child’ and you just say go to the police station. You don’t assist the parents or make a follow up on Friday when the learner is still not there. You can’t provide the transport times; a communique is sent but does not have a time when the transport will change. So we don’t have answers and I have given everyone a deadline of 2Pm today. If I don’t get the answers by 2PM today, at a minute past two, heads will roll because we can’t continue to have this kind of situation.” WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
