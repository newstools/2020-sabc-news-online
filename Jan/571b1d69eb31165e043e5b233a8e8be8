The African National Congress (ANC) says it will not be discussing the future of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan at its current National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Pretoria. Congress of South African Trade Unions is among those calling for Gordhan’s resignation following the load shedding that took place before 13 January. President Cyril Ramaphosa had said last year that load shedding would not occur before that date. Eskom Board Chairperson Jabu Mabuza quit following the resumption of load shedding this year. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says State-Owned Enterprises are indeed being discussed and they will be getting a report from Minister Gordhan on the progress made. “The National Executive Committee has never sat and discussed individual deployees, we don’t do that. It is the prerogative of the President to deploy members of the executive. We have got full confidence in all our comrades we deploy that serve in the NEC. We still believe in their ability to implement our resolutions as of the elective conference.” Click below for more on the story:
