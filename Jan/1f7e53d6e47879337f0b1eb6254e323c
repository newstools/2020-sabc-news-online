Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Basic Education has encouraged those who have failed matric not to see it as the end of the road. Over 600 000 full-time learners and more than 100 000 part-time candidates sat for the examinations. Committee chairperson Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba has wished the 2019 matriculants well ahead of the release of the results of their exams on Tuesday. “We are wishing them well. We trust and hope that they have done well they have given their time for their exams. Now is the time for results and we hope that they have done well and to those that did not make it, we are saying failing is the first attempt in learning, so it should not be the end of the road because there are many avenues they can repeat their matric and of course they will pass,” says Mbinqo-Gigaba.
