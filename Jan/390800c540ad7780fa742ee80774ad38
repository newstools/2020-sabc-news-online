Residents of Block X in Mabopane, north of Pretoria, say their patience is waning thin after more than two months without electricity. They say Eskom refuses to fix a transformer that blew up in November 2019. Area Councillor Tshepo Motaung is accusing the power utility of holding residents to ransom. “Eskom is saying to our community that all of them they must pay before they bring the transformer – illegally or legally, they must pay at least 70% of them. That is what Eskom is saying now.” Residents say the stalemate is having a severe impact on their lives. Eskom’s Daphne Mokwena on the other hand says transformers in the area keep on blowing up because they are overloaded. Mokwena blames residents who by-pass their electricity metres for this.
