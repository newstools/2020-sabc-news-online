The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture continues on Wednesday with evidence relating to law enforcement agencies. Retired colonel Johannes van Loggerenberg will take the stand at the state capture commission. On Tuesday, the Commission dealt with the April 2013 Waterkloof landing of the Gupta plane. Former Air Force employee Lieutenant-Colonel Christine Anderson told the commission that it was not her job to question who the passengers were on the Airbus 330, which had received the necessary official clearance to land there. She said she believed her responsibility was to simply ensure that the flight had authorisation and the necessary documentation from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco). Anderson was placed on special for two years following the incident and has subsequently resigned. She says that she was one of the officials whom then Chief of State Protocol Bruce Koloane admitted to the commission when he testified in July last year to have put pressure on. Click video below:
