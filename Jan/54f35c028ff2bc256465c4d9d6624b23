The meeting of the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) has concluded in Irene, Pretoria. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule says a number of issues were discussed, including the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), land reform and the economy of the country. The party’s Lekgotla will take place from Sunday until Monday. The ANC Lekgotla is an annual gathering of the governing party held twice in a year.  It meets to identify urgent priorities requiring attention and it helps to guide the work of ANC officials deployed in government in the year ahead. The gathering will be attended by ANC deployees in government, including ministers and their deputies, directors-generals, and mayors among others. The Lekgotla will expand the discussions on SOEs and the party’s mandate for the year. Magashule will also present feedback on the report on SOEs presented to the NEC by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Dysfunctional Municipalities are also high on the agenda of the Lekgotla. The Party’s NEC Lekgotla will deliberate on methods to fast-track service delivery and implement 2017 conference resolutions. The outcomes of the NEC and the Lekgotla will feed into the president’s State of the Nation Address scheduled for the 13th of next month. Watch video below:
