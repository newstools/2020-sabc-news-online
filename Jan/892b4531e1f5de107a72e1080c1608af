Political analyst Ralph Mathekga has called the threat by the EFF to disrupt the State of the Nation Address (SONA) political profiling that has no substance. EFF leader Julius Malema over the weekend vowed that his party will disrupt SONA next month if President Cyril Ramaphosa does not fire Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Mathekga says the EFF has become skilled at what he calls “targeted politics” and that the party sees Gordhan as an easy target. He says: “The EFF is very good when it comes to targeted politics. They can be credited for the removal of Zuma as the president of the Republic and now they have actually realised that Pravin Gordhan is the weakest point of Ramaphosa’s leadership and even within the ANC, they realise that Pravin is under siege.” “The deputy president of the ANC David Mabuza cast aspersions on his (Gordhan’s) leadership at the president and by implication it means that the deputy president does not believe or has got no confidence in Pravin. This actually makes him a very soft target.”
