The National Institute for Communicable Diseases((NICD) has reassured South Africans that measures are in place to detect and keep people safe from the coronavirus. This after health authorities said they are on high alert to detect the coronavirus. The death toll from the new strain of coronavirus spreading across China has climbed to 106. There are over 4 500 infected cases in China with dozens also reported abroad. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. Medical epidemiologist at the NICD, Dr Sibongile Walaza says: “It is spreading to other countries and what we have done is have systems in place for surveillance so that we can pick up any communicable diseases.” “In response to this we have strengthened that surveillance so that we are able to rapidly detect cases and respond. We have updated protocols to help the people on the front lines so they can easily and quickly identify cases so that we can respond.”
