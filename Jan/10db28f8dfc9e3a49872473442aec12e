The future of the suspended Democratic Alliance (DA) mayor of Tshwane Metro, Stevens Mokgalapa is yet to be decided as the party’s disciplinary process is still under way. Party leader John Steenhuisen told this to journalists during his site visit to the closed down Kempton Park Hospital in the east of Johannesburg. The party embarked on the first leg of what it calls the “real state of the nation tour”, which started in Gauteng. Steenhuisen said that the Federal Legal Commission of the DA recommended that the matter goes for a full hearing. “We are a party of due process which will allow Mokgalapa as well as Nicker to have a fair hearing where they will be able to put their side of the story that will then be brought back to the Federal Executive where a final decision will be made of the future of both these individuals.” Mokgalapa made headlines when an audio clip surfaced in November 2019 which suggested that he was engaged in an intimate act with then Transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge. During the 30-minute audio, the pair is also heard talking about toppling some government officials. Related video click below:
