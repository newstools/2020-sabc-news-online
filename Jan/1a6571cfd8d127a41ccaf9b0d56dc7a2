The Amathole District Municipality says recent rainfall in the Eastern Cape has brought much-needed relief to the drought-stricken area. The rainfall has resulted in the Gcuwa Weir and Hogsback Dam being full to capacity. The municipality says it is working around the clock to ensure the distribution of water to communities. However, it says this may take approximately a week as the system has been off for months due to the drought. Municipal Spokesperson, Noni Madikizela-Vuso has urged residents to continue using water sparingly. “What we are doing right now is to prepare our plants, so we can start pumping water to communities. However, we are appealing to communities to continue to use water sparingly, because we do not know if this rain is going to come again and for Butterworth we want to stress that – communities must note – we want the overflow of the Weir to stop. We will have to put restricting measures so that we can stretch the limited supply that we have.”
