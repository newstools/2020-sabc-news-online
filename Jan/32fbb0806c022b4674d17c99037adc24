Executive staff at the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) health and local government departments collaborated to inflate prices and forged documents related to tender for the supply of water purification and oxygen plants. The State Capture Commission continues to hear testimony from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forensic auditor Trevor White. White has told the commission that no due diligence was followed for the tenders worth R10 million. He also said there was no need for a water purification project something that the KZN health department created a need for. White is expected to wrap up his testimony on Wednesday. “Correct chair if one just looks Dr Nyambezi didn’t care because she is personally manipulating the procurement process. She didn’t care because she was already instrumental in asking quotations from the supplier that she wants to win the work.” White has accused various politically-connected business people and politicians in KwaZulu-Natal of corruption and fraud. Former KwaZulu-Natal MECs and former treasury boss Sipho Shabalala allegedly benefited millions of rands through kick-backs from tenders. They relate to the supply of the water purification and oxygen plants. White says Shabalala also allegedly donated some of the kick-backs to the ANC. Click below for more on the story:
