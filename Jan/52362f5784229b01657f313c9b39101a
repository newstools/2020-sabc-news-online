The South African Human Rights Commission and the family of Enoch Mpianzi, will on Tuesday go to the lodge in Brits where their son drowned. The Mpianzi’s family has threatened to sue both Parktown Boys’ High School and the Gauteng Department of Education. The Human Rights Commission says it will provide legal assistance because such an intervention is needed due to a number of parties that are allegedly implicated in Mpianzi’s death. The 13-year-old learner drowned during a school orientation camp last week. SAHRC Gauteng provincial manager, Buang Jones, says the family has requested a full probe into their son’s death. “The family believes there may be more to the story. That is why we have asserted in very strong terms that we will pressure other role players. These are not limited to the lodge and the individual educators who were in charge of this camp. We will be going with the family to Brits today and the family would want to ensure that those who are responsible are criminally prosecuted,” explains Jones.
