A 17-year-old suspect has appeared in the Seshego Magistrate’s Court, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Thoriso Kgomo. The victim was attacked and stabbed several times at Seshego zone 3 last Thursday. The grade 12 learner succumbed to his injuries three days later. The 17-year-old suspect, whom police say does not attend school, was arrested on Sunday. He cannot be named because he is facing a separate rape charge, for which he was out on bail at the time of Kgomo’s killing. He also has another case of assault that was allegedly committed in Lebowakgomo. He remains in custody and will appear again in the Seshego Magistrate’s Court on 22 February.
