The Democratic Alliance (DA) has confirmed that it has submitted an urgent application to the High Court to suspend Gauteng COGTA MEC Lebogang Maile’s decision to suspend City of Tshwane speaker, Katlego Mathebe, and former City of Johannesburg speaker, Vasco da Gama. Maile suspended the two, for six and three months respectively without pay, for breaching the municipal code of conduct after they suspended and postponed special council meetings. DA Gauteng chairperson, Mike Moriarty, says Maile’s decision places at risk the effectiveness of service delivery in the two cities. “The arguments are very simple actually; what the MEC has purported to do is act in terms of the code of conduct in the municipal systems act. But what he has ignored is that that code sets out a process and part of that process is for him to get a council resolution and for the council to say, ‘MEC we need you to terminate or suspend or whatever action you need to take against these individuals.’ He has bypassed all of that and has acted in an authoritarian manner. That is extremely prejudiced to individuals and placed service delivery in Johannesburg and Tshwane at risk.”
