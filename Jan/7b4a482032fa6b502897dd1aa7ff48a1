The mother of the Grade-7 learner who drowned at a school in Magaliesburg says she suspects foul play in his death. 13-year-old Keamohetswe Shaun Seboko drowned in the swimming pool at Learskool Bekker on Wednesday. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi will on Sunday visit the family in Eldorado Park, South of Johannesburg.  Police investigations into the drowning incident are underway. Lucia Seboko says her child was a very capable swimmer and she doesn’t understand why he had numerous bruises on his body. She says the explanation given to her by the school does not make sense. “They said there was a caretaker by the pool taking care of the kids which I don’t understand because I would think there is supposed to be a swimming instructor or a lifeguard and apaprently there were 60 kids in the pool.” “How does one child drown without anyone seeing anything,” she asks. “From the age of five my son has been swimming, there is no way that he could have drowned.” She questions the bruises found on his body.  “How does somebody have bruises on his lip, neck and on his back and then he drowned. Where do the marks come from. His underwear was also off. If somebody drowns how do you lose underwear,” says Seboko.
