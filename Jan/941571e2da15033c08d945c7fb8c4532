The Oudtshoorn Municipality in the Little Karoo has issued a warning of severe heat conditions in the area this week. Municipal spokesperson, Ntobeko Mangqwengqwe, says temperatures are expected to be around 38 to 47 degrees until Thursday. He says residents must also be aware of a total fire ban. “We also want to inform the public about a total fire ban that is in effect for the greater Oudtshoorn Municipal area during this time that they must please be careful with making open fires.” “No controlled burning is allowed during this week including refuse areas on farms as the predicted weather conditions may lead to runaway veld fires.”
