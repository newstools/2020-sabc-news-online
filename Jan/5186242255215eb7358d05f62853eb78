A 23-year-old woman who was allegedly raped by a pastor from George in the Western Cape is being accommodated at a safe house. The incident allegedly happened at the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church in Thembalethu two weeks ago. The 33-year-old Malawian pastor appeared in the local magistrate’s court on Monday where the matter was postponed to Monday next week. It is alleged that the incident took place after the woman was invited for a prayer meeting. The pastor has denied raping her, saying the incident was consensual. The woman whose identity cannot be revealed alleges that the pastor forced himself on her. “I tried to push him away, but then he overpowered me. He then started kissing me and raped me on the couch. After he was done he kneeled in front of me and told me the reason he was not speaking to me in church he knew he would fall in love.” -Report by Sphiwe Hobasi
