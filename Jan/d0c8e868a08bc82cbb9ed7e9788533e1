Congress of the People (COPE) says it will definitely vote for the removal of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane when the time comes. The party is calling for Mkhwebane to resign to save her the embarrassment of being voted out of office. This follows National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise’s decision to approve a motion to institute proceedings to investigate Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. The motion was tabled by the Democratic Alliance (DA). The party claims that Mkhwebane is unfit to hold office, citing damning court judgments against her. COPE’s national spokesperson Dennis Bloem says: “This is long overdue, for the past two years we have been calling for the removal of Mkhwebane. We are saying she was never fit to occupy that office, in fact, she has tarnished the image and reputation of that office. She must be removed as soon as possible.” Related video click below:
