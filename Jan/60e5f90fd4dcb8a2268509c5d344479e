Approximately 85 people have been arrested on Western Cape roads since the start of this weekend. Provincial Traffic Chief, Kenny Africa, says 50 of the arrests are for drunk driving. During several roadblocks held across the province, 26 undocumented people were arrested in Laingsburg and Beaufort West in the Karoo. Africa says they also arrested eight people for reckless and negligent driving in Caledon, Somerset West, Worcester, Beaufort West and Laingsburg. “Four drivers were arrested for bribery. We also arrested two drivers for displaying false licence disks on their vehicles. Three drivers were arrested for being in possession of false documentation. Then we arrested two people for resisting arrest and two drivers were arrested for assault. One driver was arrested for crimen injuria and one person for failing to comply with the instruction of a traffic officer,” says Africa. Meanwhile, Western Cape traffic authorities say they have issued fines with a collective value of over a million rand this weekend. The provincial department together with law enforcement officials have roadblocks at identified speeding hotspots every weekend. These routes include the N1, N2 and several municipal roads. “We also tested the speed of several motor vehicles and prosecuted 286 drivers for exceeding the different speed limits. The highest speed recorded in the Western Cape province was 162 in a 120 zone in Brackenfell,” says Africa.
