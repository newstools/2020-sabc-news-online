President Cyril Ramaphosa has called late businessman Richard Maponya 99, a doyen of black business, following his death on Monday morning. Ramaphosa says Maponya paved the way for the racial transformation of the country’s economy. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko says, “The president says that from Dr Maponya’s life we will learn that sometimes to get to the top you need to start at the very bottom.” “The president also called on businessmen and women, all black and white, to emulate the examples Dr Maponya has set,” added Diko. Condolences have been pouring in after the death of the businessman at the age of 99. Earlier condolences were sent to the Maponya family from businessman Herman Mashaba and trade union Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu). Former City of Joburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba says he is devastated by the passing of Maponya. He said, Maponya contributed immensely to the person he is today and says his passing is a great loss to the black community. Maponya started his business career in the 1950’s when he and his wife opened a milk distribution company in Soweto.
