An Ivory Coast high court on Friday ruled that ex-rebel leader and presidential candidate Guillaume Soro could face trial, allowing state prosecutors to continue their investigation into a coup plot they allege Soro was behind. As a former member of parliament, Soro was immune from prosecution unless a court ruled otherwise. He has rejected the allegations against him as politically motivated and remained abroad since a warrant was issued for his arrest in late December. In response to the latest court decision, Soroâ€™s lawyer Souleymane Diallo said they would consider an appeal.
