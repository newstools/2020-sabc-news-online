A bomb exploded at a busy junction in Mogadishu on Wednesday, wounding at least 11 people, the head of the rescue service in the Somalia capital has said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which happened near buildings, housing and government offices. The dead of Aamin Ambulance Services Abdikadir Abdirahman told Reuters that three of the wounded were women. There was no immediate comment from the police. At least 90 people were killed in Mogadishu last week in a bomb attack by militant group al Shabaab, the deadliest in the country in more than two years.
