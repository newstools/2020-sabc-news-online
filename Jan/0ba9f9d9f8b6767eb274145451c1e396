The rape and murder case against Aubrey Manaka who is accused of killing Precious Ramabulana has been postponed to next Tuesday at the Morebeng Magistrate’s Court near Botlokwa in Limpopo. The prosecution announced that there was an instruction by the Deputy Director of Prosecutions (DPP) for Manaka to plea at a higher court. Magistrate Lebo Nchabeleng-Raburifi says: “One of the instructions by the DPP is that you must plead before the district court in terms of Section 199 of the Criminal Procedure Act.” Nchabeleng-Raburifi read some of the charges against Manaka. “You are facing a charge of rape where it is alleged that you raped a minor child. You are going to face another charge of housebreaking with intent to rape.” “The fourth charge you are facing is robbery with aggravating circumstances and the last charge is that of murder.” Related video below
