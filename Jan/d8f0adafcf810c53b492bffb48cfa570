The body of a 15-year-old girl has been discovered in a bush near Elsburg in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. The grade nine learner from Graceland Education Centre reportedly went missing on Wednesday last week before her body was found by her grandmother and community members on Friday. Laticia Jansen’s body was found stabbed, raped and burnt. The Gauteng Education Department says Jansen’s grandmother reported her missing at the police station but no action was taken. Department Spokesperson Steve Mabona says they will deploy a team to the school to provide counselling to the school community and family. “According to information at our disposal, the girl learner didn’t come back home from school, subsequently the grandmother panicked and started checking in the neighbourhood to no avail. The next morning she then reported the matter to the police station but was informed to bring a photograph of the child, unfortunately, no action was taken. The grandparent, went to the school to report the case to the principal. It was confirmed that the child was not at school. It is also concerning that the school seemed to have not assisted the grandparent.
