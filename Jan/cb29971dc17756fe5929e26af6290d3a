Representatives of five families whose members died in a bus accident on the R81 at the Sekgopo hill near Modjadjiskloof have identified their bodies at Kgapane hospital in Limpopo. Six people, including the bus driver, died after the bus overturned. They were going to attend the African National Congressâ€™ (ANC) 108-anniversary provincial celebration when the accident happened. The deceased, including the driver, are all women and were from Steilloop in the Waterberg district. It was an emotional scene at the hospital where the families were identifying their loved ones. The lives of ANC supporters Magret Lamola , Thapelo Ngoepe, Elizabeth Seanego, Seja Hlako, and one only identified as Seabi were cut short. Little did the bus driver Rosinah Matlala know that the Sunday trip was her last. She has been a bus driver for years and many women are proud of the job she was doing as it was previously a male-dominated industry. Spokesperson of the Great North Transport bus company, Patrick Monkoe says Matlala was nominated for best female bus driver of the year award last year. Monkoe says the bus was checked before the trip and it was found to be roadworthy. Spokesperson of the bereaved families Jacob Lamola says now that they have identified the bodies and visited the crash site, the bodies will now be relocated to Mokopane. Psychologists have been sent to the bereaved families. Twenty-three others sustained injuries and were taken to various hospitals. Some have already been discharged. Government and the ANC are assisting the bereaved families in burial arrangements.
