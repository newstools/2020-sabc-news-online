The Roads Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) says it is not true that the planned points demerit system is another way for government to make money out of motorists. The Aarto Act passed by President Cyril Ramaphosa last year, will see the introduction of the system which may lead to bad drivers losing their drivers’ licenses. The Act has been met with resistance from institutions such as the Automobile Association and the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse, OUTA. RTIA demerits manager, Kwazi Ncobo says the system will work as planned to ensure that the country’s roads are safer. “What will happen is that you will accumulate points based on the nature of the traffic violation that you commit. So there will be more points for more serious traffic violations and fewer points for less serious violations. For example, drunk and driving you can accumulate six points. For driving without a license is four demerit points.”
