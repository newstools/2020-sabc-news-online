Former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela has paid tribute to anti-apartheid activist, Ben Turok – who passed away last month at the age of 92. The family had requested a private burial. Aside from his activism, Turok was an Economics Professor and a former Member of Parliament. He served as a legislator from 1994 to 2014, during which he co-chaired the Joint Ethics Committee on Members’ Interests and also served in committees on finance and trade and industry. Speaking during the memorial service of Turok in Cape Town on Saturday, Madonsela called on the younger generation to pick up where Professor Turok left off. “Think about someone who was born in 1929 still being relevant as a leader to young people in 2019 and why was his leadership timeless? It was the kind of leadership that is ethical, purpose-driven and committed to serving. Now it’s our time to take the baton and move forward from where he left us.” WATCH BELOW:
