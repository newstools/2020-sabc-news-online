The ANC has expressed concern about Telkom’s intention to retrench at least 20% of its workforce. The move will affect around 3 000 workers. Telkom SA says the job cuts will affect its wholesale division Openserve, the consumer unit as well as its corporate centre. In a letter to unions, Telkom says the planned job cuts will be managed in phases, with phase one starting now until April. ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe says they hope consultations with the unions will yield positive results. “It’s a bit of a concern for all involved. However, we are quite encouraged by what Telkom themselves have said that whatever decision or solution that they come up with would be mutually beneficial for all parties and we are hoping that in everything else that they do, they will also make sure that they put the interest of the workers first. Remember, that in everything else that our revolution is about to make sure that we protect jobs.”
