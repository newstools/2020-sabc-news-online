The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Parliament has hit back at Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, accusing her of a poor understanding of the law. This comes after Mkhwebane told a media briefing on Tuesday that the rules, adopted by the National Assembly in December last year for the removal of a head of a Chapter Nine institution are unconstitutional and unlawful. Last week, Parliamentary Speaker Thandi Modise, approved a motion submitted by the DA to establish an inquiry into whether Mkhwebane should be removed from office on the grounds of alleged misconduct, incapacity and incompetence. Mkhwebane says she has written to the Speaker to bring the many deficiencies of the rules under her attention. “I have further requested an undertaking from the Speaker that this grossly unfair process be temporarily suspended until all the issues I raise above have been adequately addressed amicably.” “I wish to stress the point that I am not against scrutiny. All I am asking for is fairness. This office and that of the Speaker of the National Assembly too are the guardians of fairness and should be exemplary,” adds Mkhwebane.
