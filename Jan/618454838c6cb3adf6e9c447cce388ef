An eThekwini Metro Police Constable, who is the prime suspect in the murder of his ex-girlfriend, is expected to apply for bail in the Umbumbulu Magistrate’s Court, south of Durban on Monday. The 30 year old Constable, Ndumiso Khumalo, who is attached to the city’s multi-operational response unit, has been accused of murdering 29-year-old Zinhle Muthwa. Her body was found on New Year’s Day next to a road in the Ndaya area of Umbumbulu with a gunshot wound to the head. Khumalo is facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Muthwa was buried at the weekend. Meanwhile, a group of Inkatha Freedom Party members is protesting outside the uMbumbulu magistrate court where the police officer is appearing.
