Voting in the by-elections at the Mamusa Municipality, in the North West, is in full swing. 28 000 people registered for the election. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) says it’s a significant increase compared to previous elections. It’s an indication that more people are using their democratic right to vote. The IEC says it expects the by-elections in Mamusa Municipality to go on without any disruptions. Voting stations opened at 7 o’clock Wednesday morning. The IEC provincial electoral officer Dr Tumelontle Thiba says Tuesday’s special votes also went on without any incident.  Various political parties – including the ANC, DA and EFF and Forum 4 Service Delivery as well as one independent candidate – are battling for control of the troubled Mamusa Local Municipality.
