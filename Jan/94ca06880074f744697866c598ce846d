The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) says the authority and power to fire the Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan, ought to be left to President Cyril Ramaphosa alone. Party MP, Mkhuleko Hlengwa has made the comments while presenting their Parliamentary strategy for 2020 in Cape Town. This comes amid calls in certain quarters for action against Gordhan following the earlier than expected return to load shedding. Hlengwa says, however, there should be an entire performance assessment of cabinet ministers, not just a knee jerk reaction to an individual minster. “As a matter of principle, the appointment of ministers is the presidential prerogative and we need to uphold that system of checks and balances and we believe that the president when he appointed these ministers he had interacted with them. He signed contracts with them and in the absence of those contracts and agreements, the public, we do not know what level the ministers are held to.”
