The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has signed a three-year settlement agreement in the Motor Industries Bargaining Council (MIBCO). Mibco represents workers in the motor sector, including in component companies, petrol stations and car dealerships. The South African motor sector also employs about 306 000 workers. Numsa secured an 8% increase for garage workers as well as dealership employees and a 7.5% increase for component manufacturers. Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says this round of wage talks was extremely tough because of the challenges faced in the economy. She says: “Despite this we managed to secure higher wages in particular for garage workers who are the lowest paid in the sector. We want to thank our officials for working tirelessly to secure these increases and we urge them to continue to serve our members to the best of their abilities.”
