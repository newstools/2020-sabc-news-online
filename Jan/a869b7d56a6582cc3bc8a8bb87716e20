The Western Cape Health Department says it is ready to act if any coronavirus cases are reported in the province. No cases of the virus have been reported in South Africa and the rest of the continent. Department Spokesperson, Maret Lesch, says surveillance systems are in place to rapidly identify and detect cases in South Africa. She says these systems include the screening and monitoring of anyone with a relevant travel history. “Together with the National Department of Health, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) has developed and distributed clinical guidelines and case definitions for doctors and nurses in both the public and the private sectors to better detect, identify and respond to possible 2019-nCoV cases.”
