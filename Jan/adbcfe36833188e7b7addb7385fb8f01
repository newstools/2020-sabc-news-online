Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he will be acting against Parktown Boys’ High School within 48 hours. The school has been under pressure following the death of 13-year old Enoch Mpianzi at an orientation camp in Brits. Lesufi says information that has implicated negligence by the school has emerged. This comes as Mpianzi’s family has heard from an eye witness, who is also a learner at the school, about the last moments before his death. It also appears that learners notified school staff present that Mpianzi had been swept away, but this information was ignored. Lesufi says they are waiting for the police to verify the information. Lesufi adds they have moved that learner from the school to ensure his protection. “We felt that we needed to protect that child and on that basis, we took the family of this child to the family of the late Enoch Mpianzi so that that information must not end up with us as a department so that the family may know what happened. That child was narrating the last moment they had with Enoch, on the basis of that information, we moved the child to another school.” Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says they are assisting Mpianzi’s family with obtaining compensation for his death.
