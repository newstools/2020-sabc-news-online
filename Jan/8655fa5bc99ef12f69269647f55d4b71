The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has been ordered to apologise and pay a fine for its comments that journalists Anton Harber and Thandeka Gqubule worked for the apartheid government. In 2018, the EFF’s Spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, referred to them as Stratcom agents. This was shortly after the death of African National Congress (ANC) veteran, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Ndlozi had cited a video clip as evidence. In the video, Madikizela-Mandela is alleged to have made false accusations against Gqubule and Harber. The two took the matter to court and the High Court in Johannesburg ruled in their favour on Friday. “It was ordered that the statements were in fact false and defamatory. It was ordered that the EFF must remove the statement from all of their online platforms and wherever they were published immediately within 24 hours and that the EFF has 24 hours to remove the statement from the Twitter account and any website. They are being interdicted from publishing any further defamatory statement of this nature against our client,” says lawyer Pooja Dela.
