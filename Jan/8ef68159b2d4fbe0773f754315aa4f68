Former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan says the last time she saw anti-apartheid activist Dr Neil Aggett alive was in early January 1982 at the then John Vorster Square Police Station in Johannesburg. She says he gave her a big smile and the Amandla salute, but she noticed that his shirt was torn. Hogan is testifying at Aggett’s inquest in the High Court in Johannesburg. She says she last saw Aggett as she was being transferred to Heidelberg from John Vorster. “And one morning Deeklifs arrives, and said that I have to go to John Vorster Square. A newspaper van drove past us, and it had a headline, a poster which said detainee’s death creates a furore, and I said to Deeklifs, ‘who have you killed?’ He turned around to me and said it’s someone you’re close to. So, I was taken to John Vorster Square. My sister was there with my parents. My sister immediately said, ‘have you  heard about Neil?’ I screamed at her and said she may not speak any further.” Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the John Vorster Police Station on 5 February 1982. Apartheid era’s security branch claimed he had committed suicide, but his family disputes that.
