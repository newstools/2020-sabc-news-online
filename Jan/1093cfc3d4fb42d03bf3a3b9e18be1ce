Western Cape Metrorail says it has received Eskom’s notification of intent to cut the power supply due to unpaid bills. Prasa owes the power utility millions of rands, but neither Prasa nor Eskom has confirmed the amount. Trains are the most popular mode of public transport in Cape Town. Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott, says at this stage commuters are not affected: “Metrorail Western Cape acknowledges receipt of Eskom’s invoice where we also confirm that it has been elevated to the highest authority within Prasa. And we remain confident that arrangements will be made timeously to settle matters satisfactory as Prasa is committed to meet its financial obligations. At this stage it has no effect on customers and we will make contingency arrangements should it come to that.”
