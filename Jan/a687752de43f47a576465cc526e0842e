Students have taken to social media to call for the re-opening of applications for the National Students Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The students, organised under the hashtag #OpenNSFAS, have started an online petition that wants President Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande to intervene. They have been posting their individual experiences about being accepted at institutions of higher learning, while they lack funding. “We have been assisting students in our personal capacity from different institutions with late registrations, with walk-ins and they would now call and say I have been accepted at this institution but I do not have funding. I understand as well that NSFAS was open for a good 3 months but it still excludes a lot of people. And I mean if you are going to allow people to apply in January and February, surely the logic should be that also funding should be made available for those people,” says Phiwaba Madokwe, petition organiser. Madokwe adds that they will be consolidating the list of signatures on Monday before sending the petition to the Presidency. “We needed the conversation being driven on social media because that is where conversations about things that affect the country are held and our target was that we are able to get traction on Sunday Twitter, which has happened. We’re trending but the trending is not just to trend but to see what the general feel is.  We have a lot of people that say I am also experiencing this thing. So we are waiting for it to get as many signatures by the end of today so that we can send it to the presidency,” says Madokwe. Meanwhile, NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo has referred queries regarding the petition to the Higher Education Ministry.    Watch a related video below:
