Parliament says one of the important milestones for the year 2020 will be the 30th anniversary of the late former President Nelson Mandela’s historic release from the Victor Verster Prison on 11 February 1990. This is reflected in the New Year’s message on behalf of National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise, NCOP Chairperson Amos Masondo and the rest of the presiding officers. They have wished South Africans well for the New Year while reflecting on the year 2019 in the national legislature. Parliament’s Spokesperson is Moloto Mothapo says 2019 was a busy year. “The presiding officers of Parliament wish all South Africans a happy and successful New Year. As we close the year 2019, we are reminded of all the many successes, challenges and victories we registered as a country and parliament. It has been a very busy year also at Parliament. A new democratic parliament was ushered in following the free and fair elections. And the sixth parliament together with the structures and new generation of MPs was set up.”
