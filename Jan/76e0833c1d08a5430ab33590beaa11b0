Instead of the usual fireworks display, the town Plettenburg Bay in the Southern Cape welcomed the New Year with a spectacular laser light show. The event at central beach attracted scores of revellers. Local Tourism spokesperson, Patty Butterworth, says the laser display was held in the interest of fire safety and to protect wildlife and pets which are sensitive to the discharging of fireworks. “We think it’s a bold move because traditionally South Africans really enjoy the fireworks displays. But with the area also being a high fire zone, I think it’s important that communities like Plett and other places who are also in high fire risk areas find alternative methods to fireworks.”   Meanwhile, Cape Town law enforcement officers say they’ve confiscated several bottles and cans of alcohol at Muizenberg Beach in the south peninsula. Scores of people have descended on various beaches to mark the start of the New Year. Mayor Dan Plato has also visited Muizenberg to assess the safety plans put in place to protect beachgoers. He says he’s received a report of a near-drowning in the area. About 360 lifeguards have been deployed to protect Cape Town beaches on Wednesday.
