Former Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, says a new political party is likely to emerge. This after Mashaba and former DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, launched what they call the People’s Dialogue – a platform which they say would be used to discuss how to forge a better future for South Africa.  Mashaba says citizens have until the end of February to make their submissions based on what they believe are South Africa’s future possibilities… “So far the indications are overwhelming to indicate that we need a new political formation. With millions of contributions or submissions already received, South Africans and I have the same fears. But in the middle to end of February 2020, we will release a public document and form a political party. If I have to close the submissions today, it is enough to form a political party, however, I have committed to run this process until the end of February.” Click on the video below:
