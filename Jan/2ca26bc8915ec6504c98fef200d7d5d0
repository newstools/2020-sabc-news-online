Nehawu is concerned about the safety of health workers in hospitals and other health institutions. Provincial chairperson in Limpopo, Jacob Adams was speaking after the body of 24-year-old medical intern, Shongile Nkhwashu was found at the Mankweng hospital on Sunday. The 25-year old man arrested for the incident is expected to make his first appearance at the Mankweng magistrate’s court this morning. Jacobs says the Department of Health must ensure proper access control at health facilities. He says: “We think that the department must take control over security services in all our health institutions because we believe that it has now reached crisis point.” “It is unacceptable, we can’t have a system which is not controlled by the owner, that is the department of health. We are appealing that the department of health must in-source all those services.”
