Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) General-Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali says matriculants should consider enrolling in technical colleges to acquire scarce skills that can guarantee them jobs. Ntshalintshali says while the outlook on jobs in South Africa is at its weakest, getting the right skills at a technical college can help young people to secure jobs. This after Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga announced that the 2019 DBE matric class had breached the 80 percent threshold for the first time. Bheki Ntshalintshali says universities are not the only viable option for students to pursue a higher education. “The mentality of our young ones is that they need to go to university, that is not where we need people most.  We need people most in the technical field, in the colleges. People who have qualified and chosen the right careers in colleges are being absorbed by the economy. In fact, there’s a deficit in that so we’ll appeal to students to think quite carefully that university is not the end by itself, but the technical one is where we need skills.” Click below for more on matric results:
