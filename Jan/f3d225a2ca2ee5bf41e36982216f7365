Limpopo traffic authorities say the collision, which claimed two lives on the N1 near Mokopane,  Limpopo, happened after one of the vehicles had a tyre puncture. Both vehicles were heading towards the south. Traffic spokesperson Tyron Maluleke says one of the vehicles which was pulling a trailer overturned after a puncture and was hit by another coming from behind.  Four people were injured and taken to the hospital. Maluleke says the road had to be closed for hours as Emergency Services personnel used the jaws of life to remove the trapped bodies. “ The vehicles were travelling from the direction of north of Polokwane to south, it is where the land cruiser which was in front of the Toyota Yaris lost control because of a tyre burst.  The Toyota Yaris slightly hit a trailer which was being drawn by the land cruiser, then the Land Cruiser lost control and started rolling whereby we lost two lives.”
