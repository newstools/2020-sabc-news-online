Train commuters will have to wait until September 2020 before a limited train service from Mabopane to Pretoria is made available. Prasa stopped the service two months ago due to safety concerns caused by severe vandalism. Prasa Administrator Bongisiwe Mpondo says the rail agency full operations will resume between April and May 2021. He says an integrated programme for the recovery of the line will focus on infrastructure development and improved security. “Key to that is also the fencing or the walling of the line. So, we will be putting up a concrete wall, about 80 kilometres between Mabopane to Pretoria. The other element is to ensure that our security plan, which walling is a big part off, as well as different types of equipment, CCTV cameras, drones and so forth.”
