Free State Police are investigating the possibility of a syndicate operating in the provincial Department of Health that steals and sells antiretrovirals (ARVs). A 33-year-old health official and another suspect have been arrested in Bloemfontein after they were allegedly found in possession of R1,2 million worth of drugs. It’s alleged that the ARVs were meant to be delivered to a clinic in Zastron in the Free State. Free State Police, Roads and Transport MEC Sam Mashinini says more arrests are expected. “We are expecting more arrests because there is a lot of information that is outstanding that we still have to get. I thank community members people who assisted us to be able to make arrests.”
