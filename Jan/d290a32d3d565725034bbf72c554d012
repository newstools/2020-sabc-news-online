An education expert says South Africa needs to change its education system. The comments comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that he backed plans to implement the policy that will see learners being allowed to leave school at the end of grade nine. The plan forms part of a strategy to have a three stream schooling system. Education expert and retired lecturer in Educational Psychology at Wits University, Dr. Meshack Ndebele, says SA should consider changing the curriculum. “It looks like we really have to consider changing our curriculum; the time has come for South Africa to change its curriculum. Given the unemployment and socio-economic challenges facing South African youth today, it is time that we reconsidered South Africa’s curriculum. This curriculum needs to respond urgently to the socio-economic demands of South Africa.” Dr Ndebele says SA also needs to consider learners’ backgrounds. “We have young people who come from diverse backgrounds. The socio-economic demands in our country differ from place to place. I think that is what curriculum planning is about; not just to ignore some of those realities to which our children are exposed.” FOR MORE, LISTEN TO DR MESHACK NDEBELE’S INTERVIEW ON SAFM’S SUNRISE BELOW: <a href="https://iono.fm/e/800253">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
