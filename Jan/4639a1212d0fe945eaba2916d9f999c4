Supporters of the family of murdered Cape Town horse rider, Meghan Cremer, have expressed shock at what they say is the lack of remorse shown by her three alleged murderers during their appearance in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Twenty-seven-year-old Jeremy Sias, 39-year-old Charles Daniels and 34-year-old Shiraaj Jaftha, each faces a charge of murder. The case has been postponed to the 30th of March for outstanding DNA results. Family supporters had this to say: “The one was a bit annoyed when he was told it’s remanded to the 30th of March, he just walked out, when the other two followed they were blowing kisses and smiling at the family, definitely no remorse of what they have done at all. All they deserve now is life imprisonment, so we are all heartsore for the family, ” says one supporter. “There is absolutely no remorse in those three people that appeared this morning, that is what I saw, no respect for the courts.  The one just walked off before the magistrate was even done,” said another.
