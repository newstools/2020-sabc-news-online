Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande has warned learners about the risks of enrolling at fly by night colleges that are more concerned with profits than education. In a statement, Nzimande said learners and parents must make sure that institutions are registered with the department of higher education. Nzimande’s spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi also advised students to check online or call a toll free number to verify the institution’s status. “Check the registration status of such private colleges with the department through its toll-free number 0800-872-222.” Alternatively, students can log on to the website of the department where the ‘Register of Private Colleges’ is published and updated on a regular basis. The website is www.dhet.gov.za/resources/registers.
