Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has assured South Africans that she is a law-abiding citizen, who pays her taxes. She was responding to a South African Revenue Service (Sars) investigation into her tax affairs dating back to 2011. Advocate Mkhwebane says she will cooperate with the probe as she has nothing to hide. “I am, however, concerned about what appears to be an abuse of state institutions to settle scores. It is a well-known fact that I have conducted and continue to conduct investigations that have not gone down well with certain sections of society. Some of those matters involve Sars. In addition, I am litigating against that institution in a matter involving the former President. I trust that this investigation into my tax affairs is in good faith.” The Public Protector has previously investigated allegations of a so-called rogue unit within Sars and made adverse findings against the tax collector.
