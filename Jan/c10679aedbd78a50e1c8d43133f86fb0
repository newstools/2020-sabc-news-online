The African National Congress (ANC) says it’s all systems go for the party’s January 8th celebrations to be held in Kimberley. This year’s celebrations will be taking place at the Tafel Lager Park stadium in the Diamond City. The party addressed the media, outlining the build-up activities ahead of the birthday celebrations on Saturday. It’s the third time the province is playing host to the ANC’s January 8th celebrations. Northern Cape ANC Secretary-General Deshi Ngxanga says, “January 8 presents the ANC and the nation with an opportunity to take stock of the progress.  We have registered and to reflect on the road that still lies ahead. It is a moment to rededicate ourselves to the unity and renewal of our movement and to intensify our pursuit of radical socio-economic transformation. It is not an opportunity for bashes or display of opulence and crass materialism.” More than 25 years into democracy, the party says it’s still mobilising to eradicate the ripples of colonialism and apartheid. Meanwhile, the party says they’ve met with the family of the ANC’s first Secretary-General Solomon Plaatje. This after angry family members removed a cage erected around his grave by the Northern Cape Department of Arts and Culture, ahead of this week’s celebrations. The family said they were not consulted. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to lay a wreath at the gravesite on Wednesday. ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte says, “We have met with the family and the president will lay the wreath on Wednesday.” A number of activities will be taking place throughout the week ahead of the big event on Saturday.
