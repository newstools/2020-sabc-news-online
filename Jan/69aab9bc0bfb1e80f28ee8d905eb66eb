Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi says Accounting may not last long as one of the subjects in school. His views reinforced by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga who also raised concerns about a decrease in the number of learners who are taking Mathematics and Accounting. But one accountant disagrees and says getting rid of the account would not be a good idea. In his tweet, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says Gauteng alone had over 35 000 learners taking accounting in 2008. And now ten years later that number has dropped to 14 7000. The University of Johannesburg Lecturer, Karabo Kekana says there needs to be a collaborated effort between universities and high schools to make the accounting curriculum more practical and interesting to learners. “This is an opportunity to assess what the impact would be if we remove accounting completely from the syllabus.” Minister Angie Motshekga, on the other hand, says poor foundation in Primary Schools fuels the lack of interest in mathematics. She says there is a need to strengthen Maths and Accounting skills in the phases of education. She reckons this will help pupils to cope better with these subjects at high school level. Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga says “Experts agree that  making Accounting a part of the curriculum in Primary School could help to sharpen the skills of learners and most likely lay a good foundation for high school and tertiary level.”
