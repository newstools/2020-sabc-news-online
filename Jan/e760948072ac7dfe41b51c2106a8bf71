African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, has reiterated that the party should take a position against the privatisation of Eskom. Eskom has been struggling to meet electricity demand in the country. Its debt stands at over R450 billion. Magashule says the power utility must remain under state ownership. He was delivering the keynote address at a rally to celebrate the ANC’s 108th anniversary at Ugu Sports Stadium in Port Shepstone on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. “(To) the people of the ANC, stand and say to the governing ANC to not privatise Eskom. Eskom must still be under the ownership of the state, and we want a developmental state. Let us not lose sight of the freedom we fought for. We got political freedom, but we didn’t get economic freedom.”
