The Democratic Alliance (DA) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) will have a meeting on Thursday in Johannesburg to discuss the power battle at Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga has confirmed that he has met with the UDM regional leadership at their request and discussed the future of the metro and a possible cooperation. He says he has approached DA national leadership, John Steenhuisen and Helen Zille, to facilitate a meeting with UDM leader General Bantu Holomisa to discuss their relations in the metro. “We have agreed that the most stable government ideologically and practically will be with the UDM, because we don’t have fundamental differences with the UDM. Therefore we have spoken to the leadership of the DA, Helen Zille and also John Steenhuisen to speak to General Bantu Holomisa and we are happy that there will be such discussions very soon,” says Bhanga. Holomisa says it’s ironic that the DA helped in removing the UDM in the metro, “We will wait to hear from them as to what has changed their minds of wanting to work with the UDM after they, together with the ANC decided to chase away the UDM in the municipality.”
