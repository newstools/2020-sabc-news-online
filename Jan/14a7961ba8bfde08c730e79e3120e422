The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department has committed to relocating Mthwane High School in Umzimkhulu in the south of the province, after a tombstone was erected inside a classroom. Learners returned to school in 2020 to find a tombstone in a Grade 12 classroom. It is believed that it was erected by a local family that is claiming the land. There are several other graves outside the classroom. Department Spokesperson, Kwazi Mthetwa, says the new site will be fully functional in less than a month. “We are going to relocate the school to a new site and as we speak, there is work that is already being done. We have provided mobile classrooms and we are just dealing with logistical arrangements to ensure that there is water and sanitation within that new site. In the next two weeks, the process will have been finalised, and teaching and learning won’t be affected. It’s just one class that has a tombstone inside and all other classrooms are functional and teaching and learning is continuing as normal,” says Mthetwa. Watch a related video below:
