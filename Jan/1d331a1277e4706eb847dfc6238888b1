The Department of Higher Education and Training has warned students to check if private learning institutions are accredited before they enroll. Higher Education officials on Thursday inspected the Durban Central Business District for bogus private colleges. The number of private colleges in the Durban CBD has increased significantly over the years. Higher Education director for Private Higher Institutions Dr Shaheeda Essack says many private colleges offer programmes that are not accredited. “We visited about 15 private colleges so far and what we have discovered is that some colleges put programmes that are not accredited, if you look at the flyers and their prospects you would discover that they are advertising something like 15 programs from the 15 programs 10 are approved 5 are not approved. That’s the big challenge, a lot of them as register in anticipation of accreditation.”
