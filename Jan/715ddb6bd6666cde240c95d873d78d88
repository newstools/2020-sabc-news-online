Police have used rubber bullets to disperse protesting residents of QwaQwa in eastern Free State. The angry protesters are demanding reliable water supply in QwaQwa, Kestell and Harrismith. Police have arrested 34 protesters for public violence after a municipal vehicle was set alight, several shops looted and roads barricaded with litter. Earlier, the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality condemned the stoning of water trucks, saying such actions would worsen the already dire situation in the area. Angry protesters have vowed to take more drastic action if the authorities fail to address their demands. They are also calling for the current mayor to step down. Residents have threatened to render the area ungovernable until their demand for reliable water supply has been met. Their anger has been sparked by the tragic death of eight-year-old Mosa Mbele who drowned on Saturday while fetching water in a river. Traffic hasÂ  also been brought to a standstill, frustrating several truck drivers and motorists. Click related videos below:
