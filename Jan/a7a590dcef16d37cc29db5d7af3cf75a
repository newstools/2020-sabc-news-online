International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor has warned that the Southern African region is not as stable as generally perceived. Speaking to South Africa’s Heads of Mission in Pretoria today, Pandor pointed to a proliferation of rebel and extremist groups on the continent, bolder linkages between transnational organised crime and violent extremists in Africa and the Middle East as well as a rise in the frequency and scale of riots and protests. “Attacks by militants affiliated with the Islamic State and Daesh in the northern Mozambique province of Cabo Delgado have raised concerns about an Islamic State presence in new territories where it has drawn allegiance from local militant groups. We should be worried – given that the attacks on Mozambique point up the presence of IS in the SADC (Southern African Development Community) region and why we always view SADC as a stable, calm region we should not rest on our laurels.” Watch video below for more:
