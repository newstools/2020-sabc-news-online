Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has called for the legalisation of cannabis in order to collect more tax revenue. He made the announcement on Twitter, saying he would put the idea to cabinet. His office declined to further comment on the matter. In the tweet, the Minister says, “the majority says: LEGALIZE IT.” “I will put the proposal to the Cabinet Lekgotla this January. The people have demanded it!”. The minister tweeted a photograph of the plant saying he found it growing on his farm and wondered how it got there. He says “should we just legalize this thing once and for all? I can see the responses! Say it”. In a subsequent tweet he says a neighbour found the plant growing on his land too “The economy of Lusikisiki and Tzaneen is waiting for legal growth of the stuff!! R4bn plus!! Tax money!!” Despite a recent Constitutional Court decision that permits home use and cultivation, the sale of cannabis on any scale remains illegal. See Mboweni’s original tweet below:
