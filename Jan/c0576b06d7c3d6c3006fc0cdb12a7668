Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu says talks at the Cabinet Lekgotla that’s under way in Pretoria will focus on the country’s State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and the economy. The meeting is being held at the Presidential Guest House and ends on Friday. Eskom’s power generation difficulties and the financial crisis at South African Airways will top the agenda. Government says it believes that it cannot successfully grow the economy if the country does not have a reliable energy supply. In an attempt to lessen the pressure for Eskom to provide electricity, the ANC Lekgotla last week approved plans for municipalities to procure their own energy, paving the way for the independent power producers’ programme. “Because we are the government, there are gaps in our SOEs, in the structures of the government at national level, at provincial level, at the municipalities. What we need to do to is arrest the capacities that seem not to be there in many of our state entities and of course in government broadly.” Cabinet will also receive reports on the state of the fiscus and the global economic outlook from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni.
