Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) General-Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to urgently deal with the crisis at Eskom. He says it does not make sense for the power utility to continue to subject South Africans to load shedding as a result of what he terms incompetence. Ntshalintshali says the Presidential committee that sits at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) under the stewardship of President Ramaphosa must do so twice a month until the problems at Eskom are addressed. Ntshalintshali was speaking at the Avalon Cemetery in Soweto during the 25th commemoration of the death of former South African Communist Party National Chairperson, Joe Slovo. “We are no forensic experts, but we know what’s wrong in Eskom. We must fix it. We are confident comrades, that the Presidential Working Committee working in Nedlac, which is chaired by the President, that sits once a month, now must sit twice a month and it must start to bare results comrades.” Watch the video below for more on Eskom:
