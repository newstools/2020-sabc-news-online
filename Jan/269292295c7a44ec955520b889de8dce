Roads have been opened to traffic in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, following Thursday morning’s violent protests in the area. Residents took to the streets blocking roads with burning tyres, rocks and rubbish bins.  They are angry over the death of 54-year-old police officer, Oupa Malatjie who was shot and killed allegedly by a foreign national who was wanted in a case of attempted murder and house robbery. The R511 linking Fourways with Centurion and Hartebeespoort has been re-opened to traffic following the violent protest. Schooling was disrupted and several spaza shops looted.  Residents are protesting against the high crime rate in the area, claiming undocumented foreign nationals are to blame. On Friday, Detective Matjie was killed while tracing suspects wanted in a case of attempted murder and house robbery. It’s understood that two foreign nationals have been arrested in connection with his murder. Police continue to maintain a strong presence in the area.
