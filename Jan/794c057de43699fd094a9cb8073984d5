Gauteng Police Commissioner Elias Mawela has condemned the shooting incident in Melville that occurred in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Mawela says the incident has marred what started off as peaceful celebrations by revellers to welcome in the New Year. He has urged police to ensure the suspects are found and brought to book. At least two people were killed and six others injured in the apparent drive-by shooting on a popular restaurant located on 7th Avenue.   Two of the injured are in critical condition. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters urges any witnesses who have information that could lead to the arrests of the suspects to report to the police. “It is reported that a BMW SUV approached from 7th Avenue and suddenly, multiple shots were allegedly fired from the BMW at patrons who were sitting outside the restaurant. Eight people were shot, two of whom were declared dead on the scene, while six were rushed to nearby hospitals with two of the six in a critical condition. Both the deceased were women aged between 30 and 40. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspects is urged to report to the police by calling the crime stop number 08600 10111 or by giving a tip-off on the MySAPS app, anonymously if they so choose.”
