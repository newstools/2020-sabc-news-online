The North West government has requested former head of the provincial Health Department Dr Thabo Lekalakala to return all its property after firing him on Wednesday. The property includes a laptop, office keys as well as a cell phone. The provincial government suspended Lekalakala in November 2018 after he allegedly paid Mediosa, a medical company that is linked to the Gupta family R30 million before it provided any services. In August in the same year, Lekalakala was arrested for fraud and he appeared before the Mmabatho Regional Court. He was released on bail of R20 000. Lekalakala was also previously arrested along with former Health MEC Finance Wendy Nelson for allegedly being an irregularly appointment to the position of head of the department in 2014. It is alleged that he lied about his qualifications and did not qualify for the position.
