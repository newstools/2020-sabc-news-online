International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor says would-be investors, especially mining companies attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos Switzerland, continue to show concerns about South Africa’s energy supply challenges. She says there is, however, appreciation for the interventions that government is taking to address the problems. Pandor says some people also shared their frustration about the time it takes to obtain a South Africa visa, especially professionals transferring to work in international companies that are operating locally.  “Certainly, on energy, there’s a lot of worry, especially from companies that are big energy users; the mining companies that are here. They are invested in South Africa and they are concerned, but they are pleased with the government’s policy decisions, which are looking at more independent generation and creating room for that. They are also happy with renewables and the IRP (Integrated Resource Plan) which has recently been published.”
