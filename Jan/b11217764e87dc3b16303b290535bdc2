Workers union, National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in the North West, says it supports the move by the provincial health department to appoint an independent team to probe allegations of nepotism at the Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital Complex. This after a list of more than 20 people, who were allegedly appointed through nepotism, started making the rounds on social media platforms. Nehawu Provincial Secretary, Patrick Makhafane, says six of their local union leaders have been incriminated and as such, they will also do their own internal investigations. “We will do our part as the trade union, to do our own internal investigations in so far as the names of our Nehawu shop stewards are concerned. Nehawu does not approve of any acts of corruption and we support any move to act harsh on any irregular behaviour by anyone,” says Makhafane.
