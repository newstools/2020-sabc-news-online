Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi says there is no insurance in place to fix schools that have been vandalised. He says this is a costly exercise for his department. There have been fires at three Gauteng schools in the past week.  In the latest incident, a storeroom at Protea South Primary School in Soweto went up in smoke. Lesufi believes there is an organised group behind the fires. He has appealed to communities to look out for those responsible and to look after their facilities. He says: “If a school is vandalised by the community, our position is clear. The cost will be zero, we will pay nothing.” “If the vandalism was caused by acts of nature or arsonists or things like that then the department will step in. But it is a long process because we need to bring structural engineers, we need to bring service providers to make an assessment and on the basis of that then we will determine how much it is.”
