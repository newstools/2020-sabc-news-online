Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed met with President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Sunday. Ahmed has urged President Ramaphosa to get involved in the dispute between his country and Egypt and Sudan over a dam project on the Nile River. Egypt is blaming Ethiopia for the failure of the latest round of talks on the construction of the dam which is a critical issue for Cairo that wants to protect its main source of freshwater for its large and growing population. President Ramaphosa is to take over the chairmanship of the African Union. He has been asked to intervene in that capacity. Ethiopian Prime was received at the Union Buildings during an official visit to the country. “With regards to Ethiopia’s interests to create sustainable cooperation with the Nile basin countries Ethiopia has always been and is committed to capitalisation of Nile water for all the Perian countries during your AU Chairmanship I hope this kinds of the issue within Africa will be somehow managed or intervened under your leadership.” Watch his media briefing on the live stream below:
