The World Health Organisation says smoking could significantly increase the risk of post-surgery complications. The organisation says new evidence reveals that smokers who quit approximately 4 weeks or more before surgery have a lower risk of complication; and health outcomes could improve by 19% due to improved blood flow throughout the body to essential organs. This also aids in surgery recovery. The WHO further adds that patients who quit smoking are less likely to experience complications with anaesthesia compared to regular smokers. Medical Officer at WHO says toxins in cigarettes lower the body’s recovery. “So we did a review of the available literature and science on this subject and we found that if people stop at least four weeks in advance of a surgery, they can reduce their risk of surgical complications. Cigarette smoking reduces the immunity of the body and you need a very strong immune system for the wounds to heal. So the risk of bacterial infections for example of the surgical wound is much higher for people that continue to smoke.” Read the full WHO Report on Tobacco and Post-surgical Outcomes below:
