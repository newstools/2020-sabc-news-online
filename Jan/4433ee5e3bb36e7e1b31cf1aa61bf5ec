Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says more work is needed to ensure that the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) delivers on its mandate. He says the agency has lost billions of rand in the past three years due to vandalism and train crashes. Mbalula has acknowledged the work of the War Room appointed in 2019 to help to understand some of the challenges Prasa is facing and to improve its performance. Prasa was placed under a administration in 2019 following years of mismanagement and poor service to commuters. Mbalula was briefing the media in Johannesburg. “Leadership at Prasa has been affected by many things over the years, boards that were dysfunctional or boards in conflict with management even the ministry so you need to clean the space hence the administrator to bring stability.” Related video click below:
