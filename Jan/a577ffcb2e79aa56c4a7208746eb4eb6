Over 100 undocumented foreign nationals in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg have been taken in and handed over to immigration officers from the Department of Home Affairs who have been deployed in the area. The officers are among the integrated team from law enforcement agencies patrolling the area. Last week, the township was rocked by violent protests against foreign nationals after the death of a police officer. Residents called on the Department to process all foreign nationals in the area to ensure that those who commit crimes can be apprehended quickly. SAPS Spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters, says police will continue monitoring the area until stability has been restored. She says: “An integrated team comprising of members from the SAPS Tactical Response Team, the Operational Response Service and the K9 units arrived Monday morning in Diepsloot and together with the police from Diepsloot, immediately embarked on patrols in the area.” “Police visibility has also been heightened since incidents of violence erupted last week Wednesday.” Related video below:
