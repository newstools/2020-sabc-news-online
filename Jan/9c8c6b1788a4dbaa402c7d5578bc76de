Former Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane, says he’s not targeting members from any specific political party. Maimane who resigned as party leader in October last year met a handful of community activists in Chatsworth, south of Durban on Saturday.  The aim of the meeting was to engage them on the launch of his new Movement for Change.  Maimane says his envisaged movement intends to hold public officials accountable. “I’m mobilising South Africans who believe in non-racialism, who believe in one South Africa, who believe that in fact we can fight for jobs we can fight for justice, who believe that we can work together to hold our public representatives accountable. Therefore these are people from different parties. I’m not sitting here targeting one party or targeting,  we are targeting all South Africans.”
