The University of Johannesburg says out of 200 000 applications, it will only be able to take 10 500 new applicants for the 2020 academic year. The university says space is very limited and not every student will get an opportunity to study with the institution. UJ’s Kinta Burger says the registrations will close at the end of January. Burger says, “In terms of our plan, UJ’s plan for new first time entering fresh from the school – we can take in 10 500 and we’ve got close to 200 000 applications. So, you can see how difficult it is to actually get a space. You need really to perform above what is just a minimum requirement.” There are no walk-ins for applications at the university, only registrations.
