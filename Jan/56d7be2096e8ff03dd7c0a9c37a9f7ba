French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit South Africa in the first half of this year. The French Embassy revealed that President Cyril Ramaphosa extended the invitation. Co-ordination for the state visit is now under way. In June – France will host African countries in the first Africa-France summit to be held in Bordeaux. French Ambassador Aurelien Lechevallier, says business investments, climate change and peace and security in Africa will be high on the agenda. “Since South Africa is now a member of the United Nations Security Council and will be chairing the African Union from next February, so certainly we have a lot to discuss a lot to work on in terms of the situation in Africa, in the Sahel for example in Libya, in the eastern DRC but also on global challenges like climate change, biodiversity. So we will focus a lot on that.’’
