The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to use his address at the African National Congress (ANC) birthday celebrations to address the drought crisis in the Northern Cape and other parts of the country. Party interim leader John Steenhuisen says: “This is a simple reality that the government can no longer afford to ignore for a single moment, and which surely has to be addressed by the President in his January 8th Statement on Saturday. The drought is not something that happens far, far away that affects somebody else.  The impact on our food security as a nation is something that will touch each and every South African and always it will be the poor of our country who will suffer the most.” For more on this story watch video below:
