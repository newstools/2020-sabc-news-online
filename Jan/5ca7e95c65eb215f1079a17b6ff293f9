Prospective students have started forming queues to register at the University of Venda in Thohoyandou in Limpopo. On Thursday the SRC halted registration. This was over free registration and temporary accommodation for prospective students who do not come from the area. Two of the prospective students say they started queuing since three o’clock this (Friday) morning. “From the first time I came on Tuesday and then they said the registration will start on the 6th January but nothing happened but even today is 10th January things are tough we don’t know what will happen,” says a student. “We came here then they chased us, they say we mustn’t enter the campus. I have arrived here at about pass five, I just think that their registration won’t go well, I don’t have any hope,” adds another student.
