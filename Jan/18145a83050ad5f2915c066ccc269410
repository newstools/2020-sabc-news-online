The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) says fathers who might have impregnated two wives or two women who will give birth in the same year should understand that they are not entitled to 10 days paid parental leave for every newborn baby. The FF Plus says it, however, welcomes the amendments made to Basic Conditions of Employment Act and other laws that make provision for fathers to be entitled to 10 days paid leave as compared to the three days they were previously entitled to. FF Plus leader Pieter Groenewald explains, “You can’t say that according to the Basic Conditions (of Employment) Act that you have the right of ten days for each and every newborn in a year. It’s only 10 days annually. If they have more than one wife and they know that there is going to be more than one baby in one year, they will have to make a choice. Practically what can happen is to say okay if you have two wives and there are going to be two babies in one year, you can take five days for one and five days for the other one,” explains Groenewald.
