South African National Parks (SANParks)  rangers have arrested seven suspects in an anti-poaching campaign in the Kruger National Park. The first group of three suspected poachers was arrested in the Skukuza area of the park. Four more suspects were arrested less than a week later in different areas of the park. SANParks’ spokesperson, Isaac Phaahla, says the rangers recovered heavy calibre hunting rifles, ammunition and poaching equipment. Phaahla says the suspects have been handed over to the police to face poaching charges.
