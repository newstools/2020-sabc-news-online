Former President Kgalema Motlanthe says the life and death of ANC MP, Ben Turok is a reminder of how one should live for your beliefs. Speaking at Turok’s memorial service in Cape Town on Saturday, Motlanthe said he remained a role model and a constant ethical leader. Turok died last month at the age of 92. The family had requested a private burial. Motlanthe called on others to be like Turok and remain on the right side of history. He says: “Today’s memorial meeting and the moving tributes are attributes of a man who proved to be nothing less than a great role model, a consistent moral leader of our time.” “This memorial service offers us a chance to become like Turok and be on the right side of history.”
