The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has warned the public not to fall for misleading information that internship opportunities for 2020 are available. The public broadcaster’s spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo says the SABC currently does not have any running internship programmes. She says it has not advertised that application processes are open. “The SABC has noted a website, which has published misleading information regarding SABC internship programme for the year 2020. Whenever the SABC has got internships, the public will dually be informed and then these internships will be advertised on the SABC’s platforms,” says Seaponelo.
