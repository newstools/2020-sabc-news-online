City Power says it has suspended execution of planned maintenance during periods of load shedding. Planned maintenance is performed to keep the electricity network functioning at its optimum level and to detect hotspots to prevent future outages. City Power says load shedding has already caused an inconvenience to customers and it would be unfair to subject customers to both load shedding and planned maintenance which will result in power interruptions. It has urged Joburg residents to ignore the memo informing them of maintenance tomorrow [Saturday] and on the 26th of this month.
