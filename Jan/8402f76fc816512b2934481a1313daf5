Photo journalist Shiraaz Mohamed has broken his silence following his return from captivity in Syria. He returned home in December 2019 after being kidnapped by ISIS militants for three years. Mohamed was captured in January 2017 after traveling to document the suffering of Syrians under war. He says he will share his story soon, but has requested time with his family for now. “I thank everyone that stood with my family trying to secure my release, for comforting my family, everyone for the support they have given. It’s good to be back in the country; it’s good to be back with my family. With regard to the money that was collected there is a process in which the money will be returned to everyone. The process has started.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
