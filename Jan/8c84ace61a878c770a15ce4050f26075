A 12-year-old girl who was reported missing in Grassy Park in the Cape Peninsula on Wednesday has been found dead in Phillipi in the early hours of Thursday morning. Police say the girl’s mother reported her missing at the local police station. Spokesperson, Brigadier Novela Potelwa, says a 48-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the girl’s death following a search involving various role players. Potelwa says vital information was followed up that led to the suspect pointing out where the body was. The suspect has subsequently been charged with murder and is expected in the Wynberg Magistrates court on Friday. A postmortem will soon be conducted to determine how the girl died and whether any more charges could be added. Western Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lt General Yolisa Matakata has expressed shock that yet another child has died in such a horrific manner. She thanked those involved in the search and reiterated that the perpetrator deserves a very harsh sentence. “While this will not bring back the life lost. The lengthy incarceration of the perpetrator will ensure the communities of Cape Town are much safer”, says Lt General Matakata.
