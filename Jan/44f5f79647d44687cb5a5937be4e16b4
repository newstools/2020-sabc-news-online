Bad roads exacerbated by heavy rainfalls in the province are now expected to be a thing of the past.  This, as the Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia De Lille unveiled a multi-million rand yellow fleet equipment. De Lille says her department’s main priority is to fix and tar roads, particularly in the country’s rural areas. In the North West, a stretch of more than 15 000 kilometres of road is to be prioritised. 25% of those roads are gravel.   De Lille unveiled new road construction and maintenance equipment in Mahikeng worth R28 million.   “We realised that there was not enough equipment to service all four districts, the main cities and towns. So before, we used to lease and rent equipment. We then decided to spend R28 million to buy extra equipment. So this is what we are handing over [to] the province,” says the minister.
