City of Cape Town health officials say they are still uncertain about a reported outbreak of chickenpox inside the Central Methodist Church building in Green Market Square housing foreign nationals Health officials were denied access to the building by some foreign nationals on Thursday. Mayoral Committee member for Community Services and Health, Zahid Badroodien, says they’ve been trying to follow up reports that two children had been diagnosed with chickenpox inside the church. “Efforts to investigate have been unsuccessful thus far as our officials were denied entry into the church on the basis that the group leader was not available. On the attempted visits, city health officials were informed that there are no sick children in the church. As an alternative, health officials made it clear what health services are available in the vicinity in case of need. Chickenpox is not a serious condition. There also no specific treatment recommended for the condition.” Watch video below:
