The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) says it is investigating an incident where a young woman was shot and killed in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The woman was allegedly shot and killed during crossfire between the police and suspects. Another bystander was shot and wounded. Community members blame one of the police officers as it is not the first time he is said to be involved in the killing of innocent civilians. On Thursday, angry residents marched to their local police station to demand answers and have accused the police of protecting the person, who they say, is responsible for Wednesday’s fatal shooting. Alexandra resident Keith Mereothle says, “What seems to be the greatest shock of all is that people of Alexandra township are not angry at the law. They are angry at this one individual who continues to take the law and make the law about himself…” “The community of Alexandra township is not worried about what the law has to say, they respect the law, they understand the law and procedure. They are just upset at this one individual who continues to kill residents and innocent people around Alexandra township, has an assassin hiding in police uniform,” added Mereothle.
