Hundreds of learners from six schools in the Eastern Cape are disappointed after the Education department withheld their results. This is due to allegations of matric exam cheating. The six schools are alleged to have cheated on subjects that include Mathematics and Physical Science. There are two in OR Tambo Coastal, two in Chris Hani East and two in Buffalo City. Disgruntled Grade 12 learners at Phangalele Senior Secondary School say parents are heartbroken and this is a traumatic experience for the learners. “We have not been sleeping many times and our parents are very much heartbroken because of this. The teachers are not giving us something that we can rely on. We keep asking them questions but they are not answering they are saying we must wait for the department on Monday to ask these questions,” says a Grade 12 learner, Lihle Toliki.  Emotions are escalating but ambitions are gradually fading out and Mbasa Hlathi knows this very well. “We do not know what is going on with us, we are watching other learners from other schools being happy and enjoying themselves and others are going to the universities whereas we are in the dark. The government must help us.” Sisa Sipeta is a concerned parent and believes such allegations will tarnish the schools’ integrity. “These learners are traumatised and the government must help us release their results with immediate effect. We don’t know when are they’re going to unblock the results. But what we are saying is that we need results now.” Sadtu provincial secretary, Chris Mdingi, has expressed frustration about the suspension of their members without formal charges. “We would await any move from the employer’s side to lay formal charges because the issue of the suspension without being accompanied by formal charges to us it’s a serious matter and needs to be sped up.” It’s a long wait for now for both learners and parents.
