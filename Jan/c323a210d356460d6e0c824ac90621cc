The Polokwane Municipality in Limpopo says it has dispatched a team to maintain roads that have been damaged. A number of roads in Polokwane have developed potholes due to rainfall and excavation projects around the city. Municipal spokesperson Thipa Selala has urged members of the public to inform them of damaged roads. “The municipal teams are currently deployed in various areas to fix the roads permanently. There is sufficient budget set aside every financial year to enhance the operations and the maintenance of stormwater infrastructure. Members of the public are urged to contact the municipality in case they notice any road-related defects,” adds Selala.
