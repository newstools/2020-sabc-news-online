The Democratic Alliance (DA) will conduct a site visit to the abandoned Kempton Park Hospital in the East of Johannesburg on Monday. The party leader John Steenhuisen, will be embarking on the first leg of what the party calls the “real state of the nation tour” around the country. The visit comes after years of indecision on the part of government whether to renovate or demolish the hospital that closed its doors 23 years ago. The party is also expected to conduct a door-to door campaign in Tembisa. The party has called on Health MEC, Bandile Masuku to make a decision as a matter of urgency as the Tembisa Hospital is struggling to service people from Kempton Park and neighbouring suburbs. Numerous promises over the years to reopen the facility amounted to nothing. An investigation commissioned by the health department in 2015 at a cost of R12.8 million into the structural integrity of the hospital, recommended that the hospital be refurbished and operated as a district hospital. This contradicted the department’s intentions to demolition the hospital at a cost of R127 million.
