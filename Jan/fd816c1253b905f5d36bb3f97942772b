Gauteng MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Lebogang Maile has called former Speaker of Johannesburg Vasco Da Gama a ‘constitutional delinquent’. Maile said this was the reason he was suspending him for three months without pay. Da Gama along with City of Tshwane Speaker Katlego Mathebe have been suspended as councillors without pay. Mathebe’s suspension will extend to six months. Both the City of Johannesburg and Tshwane recently lost their mayors with Tshwane descending into chaos. Addressing a media briefing, Maile said he gave the two sufficient time to provide compelling reasons not to be suspended but they failed to do so. Watch the media briefing below:
