Newly-appointed Western Cape Police Commissioner Yolisa Matakata has outlined her vision for policing in the province. She was speaking at a meeting with Premier Alan Winde and provincial Police Minister Albert Fritz. Matakata says police will focus on the main generators of serious violent crimes such as drugs, alcohol and illegal firearms. In her view, boots on the ground are key in addressing crime, but dealing with socio-economic factors that impede policing initiatives are also crucial. Matakata says her list of priorities includes collective leadership. “It is a fact, it’s known that there is an issue around leadership in this province and it is really incumbent of me, for us to achieve policing and the service that needs to be rendered in the province. It’s necessary that we have cohesion as a team,” says Matakata.
