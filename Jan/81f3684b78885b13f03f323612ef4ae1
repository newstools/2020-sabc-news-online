Former Johannesburg Executive Mayor, Herman Mashaba, says he is happy with inputs that South Africans made during consultations on the party he is going to launch later this year. He says the inputs will be used to ensure that the party represents the aspirations of all communities. “We are now so happy down the line that the sole purpose of people’s dialogue was to engage ordinary South Africans to communicate and give us input on the type of South Africa they want. So with the input received so far we are now convinced and satisfied that by June this year, we will form a political party, a political party to contest the 2021 local government elections,” says Mashaba.
