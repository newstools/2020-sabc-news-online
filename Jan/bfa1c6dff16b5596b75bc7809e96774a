The family of 13-year old Enoch Mpianzi says all it wants is to see justice being served for the boy’s death. On Tuesday, the family together with the South African Human Rights Commission went to the Nyati Bush camp site in Brits in the North West to conduct an inspection. However, they were denied access to the facility and were forced to enter the premises, by jumping over the gate. The Parktown boys high school learner drowned in the Crocodile River while attending a grade 8 orientation camp at the facility last week. It’s understood that Mpianzi was swept away after the makeshift raft he built together with other learners capsized during an activity. Mpianzi’s father Ekhila Guy says he’s devastated.  “It’s very painful. Very painful, even you, I don’t know how you will feel if they brought you to see where your son or your brother or your relative dies in such a condition, how will you feel, it is very painful. We are seeking for justice, we are seeking for justice.”   Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) Gauteng Manager, Buang Jones, says they want the police to issue a warrant of arrest for the owner. “The owner has not granted us access, the gate is still locked. We are told by the manager that the owner is consulting her lawyers. We have asked the SAPS to consider issuing a warrant of arrest because they have obstructed and interfered with our lawful investigations as a Chapter 9 body. The conduct of the owner amounts to a criminal offense from the proper reading of our act.”
