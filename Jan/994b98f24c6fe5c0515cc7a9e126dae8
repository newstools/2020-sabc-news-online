African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says land reform will be conducted according to the party’s 54th elective conference resolutions. On Monday, he told the media in Irene, Pretoria after the ANC lekgotla that women would be in the fore-front of the implementation process. Ramaphosa says land reform should be considered a business in which many can benefit economically through a partnership between government and other stakeholders. “The advancement of women in land reform and women must be considered especially in communal land and regards to ownership of land. And women of our country, must be at the centre of the land debate. Trade agreements with other countries should also prioritise black emerging farmers.”
