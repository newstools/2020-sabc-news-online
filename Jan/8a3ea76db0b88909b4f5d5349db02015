A week long wage strike by over 4 000 Unisa workers at the institutions seven regional campuses across the country continues amid talks between management and the unions. Prospective students have been advised by the university to apply and register online amid the on-going strike by the university staff. The university has now extended the closing date for the first semester registration to 1st February 2020. Workers, mostly members of NEHAWU and Association for Professional Workers Union of South Africa, are demanding 9% salary increase while the university is offering 6%. UNISA spokesperson Dr Mbusani Netshitomboni says: “We are mindful of the fact that there’s a strike that is on going which also makes it difficult for students to register at our campuses. “They should register online though its still too early to make a full assessment of the potential impact at the registration level.” “If it goes beyond the anticipated time, its gonna have an impact on our operation. As of Wednesday we had in excess of about 225 000 completely registered students and we are looking at just around 375 000 students. NEHAWU spokesperson Khaya Xaba says their strike action will only cease once UNISA management has acceded to the workers demands which include the in-sourcing of all workers. He says: “CCMA is looking over the negotiations between us and the management and we hoping that maybe by the end of Thursday we will be having an outcome. We are giving them a chance.” “Having said that, the strike will continue until the employer listens to us. Our demand is 9% salary increase. The in-sourcing of all out-sourced workers and the issue of compliance to occupational and health standards.”
