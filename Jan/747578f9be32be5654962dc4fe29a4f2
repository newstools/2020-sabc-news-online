The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants both the national and the Limpopo provincial governments to take urgent action against an alleged cover-up of rigged tenders and unlawful payments in the Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. DA Shadow Deputy of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Cilliers Brink says the party is in possession of damning documents against some municipal officials. He says they reveal how the municipality awarded two tenders to Turnkey Capital Projects in June and July 2019, without following a competitive bidding process. Brink says one of the projects was for the refurbishment of the Namakgale Stadium, while other was for the installation of storm water culverts in various areas. He says the documents can be made available to both governments on request.
