A memorial service for businessman Richard Maponya has taken place at Winterveld outside Pretoria. Plot owners and residents are honouring a plot owner, a neighbour and a farmer who mentored many young people in farming. Maponya passed away last week Monday, aged 99. He will be buried on Tuesday in a special official category two funeral. Among his successes is Maponya Mall situated in Soweto. Memorial service organiser Julia Maselela says: “We are honouring a life lived well. We are honouring a community member, a neighbour and a farmer in the area of Ten Morgan Winterveld, Richard Maponya. “ “Maponya mentored many lives here. We have a community group called Maropeng Goa Boelwa. Maponya played a very big role together with Motsuenyane and the late Kgosana. Maropeng exists because of their wisdom and their support to us.” Click video below:
