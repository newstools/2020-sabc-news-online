The Student Representative Council (SRC) at the Buffalo City Campuses of Walter Sisulu University (WSU) has accused the institution of introducing a flawed digital registration system, which disadvantages the poor. The students’ leadership stopped registration as thousands of students reportedly struggled with the system. SRC President Sipho Sizani says not all stakeholders are familiar with the new system. “The problem with the registration is that not all stakeholders involved or included in the registration are familiar with this process of registration with this new system.” “Finance is not familiar with the system NSFAS is not familiar with the system seemingly only admission is familiar with the system hence we find ourselves in this.”
