The Northern Cape Department of Agriculture says the R300 million pledge for drought relief in the province by Minister of Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu, will be used for funding alternative water sources such as drilling boreholes in drought stricken areas. 60% of the province has been declared a drought disaster area. Provincial department spokesperson Zandisile Luphahla explains how the money will be used. “The money will be used for funding alternative water sources, such as drilling of boreholes and water technology in farms across the province. This intervention will enable us to mitigate the devastating impact of the drought on the economy of the province and food security.”
