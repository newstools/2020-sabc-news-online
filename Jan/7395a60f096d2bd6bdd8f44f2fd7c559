Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) General-Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali has expressed concern about the no show of the ANC leadership in Soweto for the 25th anniversary of former SACP National Chairperson, Joe Slovo’s passing. Ntshalintshali says this is against the spirit of Ubuntu and Africanism. He says it is disappointing that out of the 19 leaders at the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee, not a single one bothered to attend. “You can’t come to a grave and make commitments you can’t keep. The ANC has got 19 leader comrades, 19 leaders in the NEC. If they can’t send not even one leader here… then our movement is in danger comrades, it can’t happen that way,” added Ntshalintshali.
