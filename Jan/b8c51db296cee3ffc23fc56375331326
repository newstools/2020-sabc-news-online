The Nelson Mandela Municipality in the Eastern Cape has conveyed its condolences to the families of the four children who died after consuming a toxic substance at an illegal dumping site in Motherwell on Sunday. The deceased were members of two different families. They are ten-year-old Zintle Mqawu and her three-year-old brother Alunamda as well as three-year-old Alizwa Rhwayibana and his sister, ten-year-old Asive. A seven-year-old boy, Asiphile Grootboom, survived the ordeal. Municipal spokesperson, Mthubanzi Mniki says illegal dumping sites are a challenge. “We need to intensify awareness to our people about the dangers of these illegal sites. This incident forms part of the dangers of illegal dumping. We have always tried to make our people understand, so as a municipality we will intensify our campaign.”
