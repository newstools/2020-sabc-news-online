Descendants of the first secretary-general of the African National Congress (ANC), Solomon Plaatje say they are relieved that the cage erected around his grave has been removed. Plaatje family members from across the country called a press briefing at Sol Plaatje museum at Kimberley in the Northern Cape. They said the erection of such a cage was an insult not only to the family but to Sol Plaatje himself. One of the descendants Richard Plaatje says they are happy and relieved, now that the cage has been removed. “As a family, this cage actually made us feel as if we were also in a cage, so you can imagine when this thing has been removed Sol Plaatje himself can feel free. We do not need a cage for people to come and honour Sol Plaatje, this has not been one of the most pleasant festive seasons for us. We have been pleading with the authorities requesting them that please respect our rights and to remove this thing. You cannot cage Sol Plaatjie, you cannot cage any person in the grave you can only put a prisoner behind a locked cage,” says Richard Plaatje. Watch video below:
