Police are conducting a raid in Kliptown, Soweto, following the murder of a man last week in an apparent mob justice incident. The victim, believed to be 19 years old, was allegedly set alight by angry residents. They accused him of being part of a group of young people, involved in robberies, murders and even selling body parts. No one has been arrested in connection with the murder.  Dalipkumar Balinath from the Kliptown police station says the raid is a response to the community’s pleas. “This visibility will continue. We have all the units from the provincial office, especially the TRT.  That community was crying out … that we show high visibility patrols so that we can look for the alleged gang members. The community spoke about the drug dealers, as well as unlicensed liquor premises that will be closed and shut down,” says Balinath.  Police will be implementing security interventions in various schools around Soweto to curb gangsterism. Frustrated residents in Pimville Zone 3 say they have also had enough. Community leader Sam Ndlovu claims that gang members gather at this park to plan their next hit. Ndlovu says most members of the groups are minors, making it hard to apprehend and detain them. Police say they will be in talks with community leaders to organise community policing forums near hotspot areas. -Additional reporting by Nosipho Mncube
