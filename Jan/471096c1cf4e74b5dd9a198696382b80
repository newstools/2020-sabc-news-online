The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it will soon write to Parliament to request that Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe appear before it as soon as possible. this follows the mass resignation of board members at the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa (NECSA). The DA has called on Mantashe to account for the situation at NECSA. The party blames him for not being willing to engage with them and also being unresponsive in matters relating to the entityâ€™s deep financial problems. NECSA has reportedly been insolvent since 2016 and is asking government for a R500-million bailout. In a statement, the DA says it notes the developments at NECSA with great concern.
