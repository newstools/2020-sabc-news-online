Many Iranians have voiced support for the retaliatory missile attack against the United States after the latter killed the influential Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in airstrike. Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) on Wednesday fired over a dozen of surface-to-surface missiles on the US bases of Al-Asad and Harir Camp to the north of Erbil, Iraq. “This is a response to the crime committed by the US It is necessary to let them know that they cannot bully us. We do not accept their threat and oppression,” said a Tehran resident. “We are happy to see the retaliatory attack against the US We are not combative but we have to fight back,” said another resident. Soleimani, commander of IRGC Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq’s paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces, were killed Friday in a US airstrike near the Baghdad Airport. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the main reason for the Iranian retaliation against the US is that American forces must be expelled from the region forever.
