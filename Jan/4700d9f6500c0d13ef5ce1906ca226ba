A large contingent of emergency workers have gathered in Friemersheim near Mossel Bay in the Southern Cape, following Thursday’s light aircraft crash. The Cessna Citation aircraft, operated by the SA Civil Aviation Authority, took off from the George Airport shortly on Thursday morning with three crew members on board. It disappeared from radar 10 minutes later. The bodies of two men and a woman were recovered on Thursday afternoon. A helicopter is busy ferrying emergency workers to the crash site in the mountains near Friemersheim, not far from the Robertson Pass that links Mossel Bay and Oudtshoorn. The wreckage is said to be strewn over an area equivalent to a rugby field. Bad weather conditions prevented any sort of rescue mission on Thursday, but today’s weather is more favourable. The 33 year old plane was on a calibration mission which means it was testing aviation instruments to ensure airport safety. Meanwhile, The Civil Aviation Authority is hosting a media briefing in Midrand, Johannesburg on Friday following the incident.
