One suspect was shot and wounded when trying to allegedly hijack a man at his home on Kenilworth Road in Overport, Durban. It is believed that the man, who was in his driveway when a car with four suspects pulled over and opened fire, returned fire and wounded one of the suspects, who was later treated on the scene. The other three suspects fled the scene. PT Tactical Unitâ€™s Dhevan Govindasamy says the suspects are still at large. The four suspects were travelling in a white Toyota Etios. The suspect who was wounded was transported to the nearest hospital. Bullets were exchanged between the homeowner and the suspects who fled towards Mariannhill.
