The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Chief Whip in Parliament, Natasha Mazzone, says they welcome National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise’s decision to accede to their demands for an inquiry into the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. According to the DA, Mkhwebane is not fit to hold office. The party made the initial request nearly two years ago but it fell away when the term of the fifth Parliament ended. After the issue was revived after last year’s elections, Parliament adopted rules to make the removal of the head of a Chapter Nine institution possible. Mazzone says the party is relieved that the matter will be given consideration. “This has been long time coming and we have finally reached a stage where Parliament has adopted rules that allow for the removal for the head of a Chapter Nine institution. We are finally going to see accountability for what has been a disastrous tenure for this particular PP,” says Mazzone.  Watch a related video below:
