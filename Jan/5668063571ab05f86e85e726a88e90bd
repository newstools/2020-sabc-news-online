The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has dismissed claims that its bank account has been frozen due to non-compliance with a Labour Court order. The party was responding to claims made by its employee Brain Tawana, with whom it is involved in a bitter labour dispute that dates back to 2015. The party’s National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says they have met all their financial obligations for January. “The accounts of the EFF are fully functional including all our financial obligations that relate to salaries and any other matter for this month end has been sorted out including bonuses. We are meeting all our financial obligations, are above board and therefore there are no account problems in the EFF.  The matter relates to a labour dispute which will be heard and ventilated in court next week Tuesday.” According to Tawana, he was targeted and unfairly dismissed shortly after the party’s first National People’s Assembly because he did not share party leader Julius Malema’s views. He says since winning the dismissal case at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in 2015, the party has failed to comply with every order.
