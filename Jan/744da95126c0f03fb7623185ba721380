Acting Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi says the number plate on the vehicle used in the New Year’s Day shooting in Melville, in Johannesburg, was cloned and the registered owner was nowhere near the area when the incident occurred. Two people died and six others were wounded in the drive-by shooting at a restaurant in Melville. Lesufi says he has received reports on the progress of both investigations into the Melville and Newtown shootings and he is confident that a breakthrough in the cases will be made soon. “We received an extensive report from the law enforcement agencies, in terms of the Melville attack the police are convinced that they are about to crack that case.” “The car that was involved was a cloned car the number plate does not match the car. In terms of the Newtown case it’s a difficult one because the CCTV footages they were not working and it makes things very difficult but from their information I am confident that they will crack it as well.” Eleven people were wounded in the Newtown incident, which occurred just two hours after the Melville tragedy.
