Scores of students at the North West University’s Mahikeng Campus are picketing at the main entrance of the university. The students shut down the campus since Monday as part of the South African University Student Union’s call for a seven day national shutdown of all public universities. They are demanding the eradication of debt, free registration for the poor and a revision of guidelines for accreditation of student accommodation. The Campus remains closed as students are picketing at the entrance. The students have vowed to continue with the shut down until their demands are met. They have defied an instruction by the management to vacate the campus by three o’clock Tuesday afternoon. Students were instructed to leave the premises after allegations that some students were assaulted and university property damaged on Monday night. The university staff has again returned home.
