The ANC has called for investigations into all historical contracts impacting negatively on South African Airways. This after SAA was placed under voluntary business rescue, ahead of the arrival of a R2 billion cash injection from government. The airline has cancelled at least 30 domestic flights between Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban and ten return flights to the city of Munich in Germany. The airline says it cannot rule out further flight cancellations. Speaking during a media briefing at Luthuli House in Johannesburg, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule delivered the outcomes of this weekend’s NEC meeting and NEC Lekgotla. “We need to ensure there is improved performance. We investigate all historical contracts impacting negatively on SAA including the lease of airplane and contracts. The socio-economic mandate of Public Enterprises needs to be strengthened and government oversight structures should be streamlined and respond more rapidly to challenges as they arise. Business models of Public Enterprises should be reviewed and those under financial pressure should be prioritised.”
