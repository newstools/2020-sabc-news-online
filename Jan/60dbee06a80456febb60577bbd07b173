ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has assured South Africans that the government is working to restore stability at Eskom and ensure its capability to deliver energy. He was addressing the ANC gala dinner on Friday night ahead of the ANC’s 108th anniversary celebrations and his delivery of the party’s January 8 statement in Kimberley in the Northern Cape on Saturday.  Ramaphosa says the ANC leadership is not divided on its views about Eskom. This, after party deputy president David Mabuza accused Eskom board and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan of misleading Ramaphosa about load shedding. Ramaphosa says the party stands united. Ramaphosa accepted Eskom board chairperson Jabu Mabuza’s resignation and thanked him for his short stint at the helm of the cash-strapped power utility. Mabuza resigned on Friday after failing to keep his promise that there would be no load shedding before January 13, 2020. Speaking at an ANC gala dinner, Ramaphosa said Mabuza has apologised for his failures. WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:  Watch ANC gala dinner on Friday:
