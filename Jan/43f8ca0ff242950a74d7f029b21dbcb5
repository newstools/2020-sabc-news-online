Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has strongly cautioned the State Capture Commission’s legal team to ensure that witness testimony complies with the inquiry’s terms of reference. This was at the outset of the testimony of Hawks boss Godfrey Lebeya. In his affidavit to the Commission, Lebeya alleges that former Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega ill-treated and sidelined him despite him being one of her Deputy Commissioners. He says she did this because of his investigation into irregularities at crime intelligence and his involvement in the inquest against former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli, who was being investigated for his involvement in the death of a lover’s partner, amongst others. In 2014, Lebeya ultimately hauled Phiyega before the courts for seeking to forcibly move him to another department. Zondo questioned if much of the claims made by Lebeya fall within the scope of the Commission’s work. “The way that doctor Lebeya was treated as reflected in the statement can it be said that it falls within the terms of reference. Was it corruption, was it fraud, was it state capture or could it be that maybe she just did not like him for whatever reason which would be wrong itself. But not everything that is wrong falls within the terms of reference of the commission,” says Zondo. Click link below for more on the story:
