Management of the North West University has convened a meeting with parents of students at the Mahikeng campus for this coming weekend. This as students had shut down the campus, as part of the South African University Student Union’s call for a seven day national shutdown. The Union of Students is demanding the scrapping of historical debt, free registration for the poor and the funding of post-graduate studies among others. The University’s Vice Chancellor Dan Kgwadi, says they are worried about the situation on campus as some students and workers are intimidated by striking students. He says next week the Potch and the Vaal campus will be starting with their Academic programme, the worry now is that Mahikeng will be left behind. “These three campuses are on aligned programmes. We will not be in any way ready to postpone academic programme because of the disturbances that are going on and for that reasons. I am inviting parents for Saturday 1st February at 10 o clock so that we can update them on the situation on campus,” says Kgwadi.
