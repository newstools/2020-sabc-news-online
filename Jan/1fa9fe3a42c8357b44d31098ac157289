Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has sent his condolences to the families of the seven people who died in a taxi crash in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday morning. The six women and a man were among the 22 people who were travelling in the minibus taxi which rolled down an embankment on the R102 between Umhlali and Salt Rock.  It is believed that the taxi was overloaded and the driver might have lost control of the vehicle.  Thirteen other people sustained moderate to serious injuries. Mbalula has wished them a full and swift recovery. “The Minister has also called on those who will be making their way home in the next coming days maybe returning from holiday destinations to please drive safely and please make sure you arrive alive,” says Mbalula’s spokesperson Ayanda Allie Paine.
