Tensions are high at the North West University’s Mahikeng campus. The students shut down the campus since Monday as part of the South African University Student Union’s call for a seven day national shutdown of all public universities. They are demanding the eradication of debt, free registration for the poor and a revision of guidelines for accreditation of student accommodation. University management has deployed Tactical response teams to beef up security as the SAU national shutdown of public universities reaches its 4th day. The students have vowed to continue with the shut down until their demands are met. Meanwhile, out-sourced workers at the North West University’s Mahikeng campus risk losing a portion of their salaries amid a shutdown at the university. Workers have been unable to report for duty since Monday. This is as students had shut down the campus, as part of the South African University Student Union’s call for a seven day national shutdown over registration, student debt and student accommodation on campus. A representative from the National Association of South Africa Workers, at the university, Fanon Moema says the impasse is impacting them severely. He says some workers arrive between 3AM and 4AM only to be told not to access the campus. They end up in the streets. He says: “In the process of ending up in the streets, their lives are in danger, they are being intimidated to leave and go back home.” “When the manager arrives they are told you were not at work on this particular day which means they can’t get their salaries.” Come month and the employees are not given full salaries, we are going to fight, gloves are off,” says Moema.
