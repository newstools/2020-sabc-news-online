The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has warned of the possibility of protest action if Telkom fails to follow proper processes on the retrenchment of workers. Telkom and unions entered into a consultation process on Wednesday over the telecommunication company’s plans to retrench 3 000 employees. Telkom has over R11-billion worth of debt and is struggling with declining performance in fixed voice and data services. The firm says they require less staff as they embark on modernising technologies. But CWU Secretary-General Aubrey Tshabalala says Telkom needs to use new technologies to create job opportunities. “Six months ago they consulted with workers and gave a roadshow saying the company is stable. They said that with the intention of workers not to demand the bonuses that they were due to give them. So at this point in time, we have to mobilise workers and go to the streets if the processes in terms of the Act are not satisfactory. We believe that the current executive has dismally failed in terms of turning the company around and responding to new technology demands,” says Tshabalala. The CWU briefed the media on Wednesday afternoon and expressed concern over looming retrenchments. Watch the media briefing below:
