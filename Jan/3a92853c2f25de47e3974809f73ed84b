The event was held in the troubled Northern areas, known for gang violence. The community also weighed in on the event calling for more police visibility. Khoi and San activist Christian Martin says: “The fact that they happy that the police are commemorating fallen hero’s but the fact remains the area they live in needs more visible policing because the gang violence is killing innocent children and men.” Police Day is celebrated to reflect on the previous year and to appreciate serving members as well as to pay homage to fallen heroes.
