Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has encouraged South African businesses to invest in his country. Ahmed, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, last year for ending a decades-old stalemate with Eritrea, was in the country on a 2-day official visit. He briefed the media following a bilateral and diplomatic relations meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Sunday. “Ethiopia is now opening up to private capital in telecommunications, energy, logistics and other industries which South African investors have great experience on these fields we also discussed the way in which we could boost our trade volume between our two countries considering the great potential that exists particularly through the opportunities that the African continental free trade area provides for bilateral and intra-regional trade.” Click on the video below:
