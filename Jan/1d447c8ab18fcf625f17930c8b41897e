Power utility Eskom says thereâ€™s a high possibility of load shedding Thursday evening. This is due to the power grid being under immense strain. The power utility says they were forced to use diesel generators on Wednesday night to meet demand. Eskom says that while they have adequate emergency reserves to supplement capacity during the day, they may need to implement load shedding in the evening. This will be done in order to augment diesel and water at their open cycle gas turbines and pumped storage schemes.
