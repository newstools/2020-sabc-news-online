Newly-appointed Eskom Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha, has defended his latest position, saying he has an opportunity to serve the nation. The power utility appointed the veteran journalist last week, citing its intention to improve its public image following recent bouts of load shedding and allegations of financial mismanagement.  Mantshantsha, who is due to begin his duties on 1 February, says government needs to allow professionals at Eskom to work towards making the power utility sustainable. “This is an opportunity to serve South Africa in a different capacity. I did that for the past 15 years in the media, now you turn around and say that we have had some positive changes in the management team and the board over the past two years. Can we work with this institution to make it work for the people of SA? If government does not step back and allow the management and professionals on the board of Eskom and the team to do what they need to do, we will have a new CEO again. We have had 13 CEOs in the past 10 years; that cannot continue.” FOR MORE, WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
