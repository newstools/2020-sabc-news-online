Africa’s largest privately-owned airline, Airlink says it will operate under its own “4Z” flight code on services operated with effect from 11 June 2020. In a statement released on Thursday, the airline has described the change as new era in the long-standing commercial agreement with SAA. Airlink and South African Airways (SAA) have redefined their partnership by replacing their franchise agreement with a new commercial arrangement from 11 June 2020. Airlink says it expects the new transition to have minimum inconvenience to customers. The company CEO and Managing Director, Rodger Foster has described the move as an exciting period for the airline. “Marketing and selling flights under our own 4Z code is an exciting development for Airlink as we propagate our business and take advantage of new market opportunities.  At the same time, we will be able to strengthen our vital partnership with SAA.”
