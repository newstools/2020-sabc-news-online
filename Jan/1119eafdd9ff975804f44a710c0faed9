DA leader John Steenhuisen embarks on what is being called “The Real State of the Nation Tour” in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal.  The party says the tour will engage with communities across the country on some of the most pressing issues that affect them daily. The party says it wants to engage with South Africans on bold alternatives to the very serious challenges such as unemployment, safety and the rising cost of living. Steenhuisen is expected to visit several communities in the greater Durban area on Friday, starting at the city hall and travelling to Clairwood, Phoenix and Verulam.
