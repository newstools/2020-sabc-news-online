The family of 29-year-old Zinhle Muthwa, who was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend a Durban metro policeman, is demanding that the case be transferred to another court. The family has expressed their concern about the delays. This follows Monday’s postponement of the bail application of the accused because the presiding magistrate was absent from work. The family of the deceased has been left with more questions than answers. Zinhle Muthwa’s body with bruises, head injuries and a gunshot wound to the head was found in a nature reserve in the south of Durban. The accused is believed to be the last person seen with Muthwa before her disappearance. He is also a metro cop officer and it’s alleged he may have used his service pistol to commit the crime. The accused has been charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice. The victim’s brother Mbongeni Muthwa says: “There is definitely something going on here. The accused is a policeman. This is why we want the case to be transferred to another court.” Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters also attended court proceedings. They have called for a special court for gender-based violence cases to prevent unnecessary delays. IFP woman’s brigade Phumzile Buthelezi says: “We wish we had a special court for the case. We are told there is one magistrate and there are different cases, even minor cases. These cases must have a special court and a special magistrate that attends to these cases.” The case has been postponed for a bail hearing on Friday in the same court.
