The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in KwaZulu-Natal has expressed deep concern about what it says is a lack of security at the provinceâ€™s public hospitals. The party has called on Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu to come up with a well-detailed plan with clear time-frames and tangible solutions on how she intends to improve security at provincial hospitals. The call comes after two armed men stormed past security at Clairwood Hospital in Mobeni on Friday evening, killing a patient in full view of hospital staff and other patients. The suspects allegedly forced their way out of the hospital by pointing guns at the hospital guards.
