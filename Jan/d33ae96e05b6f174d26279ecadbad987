An emotional former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede says months after her arrest, the state has failed to indicate what charges link her to the Durban Solid Waste R389 million tender. She addressed hundreds of her supporters outside the Durban Magistrate’s Court after the case was adjourned to 16 April.  Gumede again maintained her innocence. “We thank you for your support comrades; initially I did not want to discuss what happened inside the court. I will try and be strong as a Christian. We did not join the struggle to be abused, like when someone wants the position I am occupying, they should go as far as playing dirty just because you want the position. Inside the court, it is almost a year, until today they are unable to formulate charges against us.  Let’s remain calm because everything happens for a reason.”
