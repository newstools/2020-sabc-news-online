China‘s National Health Commission has warned that the ability of the coronavirus to spread is getting stronger and infections could continue to rise. More than 2000 people globally have been infected and 56 people in China have died from the virus. Speaking at a media briefing, China’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei, said knowledge of the virus is limited. Ma says the incubation period for the coronavirus can range from one to 14-days, and that the virus is infectious during incubation. This was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS the coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800-people globally in 2002 and 2003. The new virus has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France and Canada.
