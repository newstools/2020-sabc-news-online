Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane has agreed to step down and retire from his position. This comes after his party, the ABC and the opposition coalition applied pressure on him to vacate office. Thabane and his wife, Maesaiah, are linked to the murder of Thabane’s first wife. President Cyril Ramaphosa sent former minister, Jeff Radebe, as the special envoy to Maseru to facilitate transitional talks. Radebe says the coalition government will shortly announce steps towards Thabane’s retirement. “We are very optimistic as a special envoy, myself and Deputy Minister, Zizi Kodwa, about what we heard as the coalition partners and they were telling us about how the next few days would be unfolding.”
