Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane has been interviewed by the country’s Deputy Police Commissioner. The South African Broadcasting Corporation has reliably learnt that Thabane was interviewed at his home in Maseru to assist the police with the investigation into the assassination of his former wife Lipolelo Thabane in 2017. Lipolelo was gunned down two days before Thabane’s inauguration. Another coalition leader Keke Rantso and Minister of Small Business Chalane Phori were seen at the police headquarters vicinity. Allegations surfaced that they were also asked to appear to assist police with investigations. On Tuesday, the leader of the Basotho National Party (BNP) also appeared before the Deputy Commissioner for questioning. The much-anticipated protest march intended to petition the Prime Minister to retire was expected to resume at lunchtime on Wednesday.
