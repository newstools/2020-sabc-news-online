Power utility Eskom has appointed one of its former senior project managers, Avin Maharaj to head up their Kusile power station construction project in Mpumalanga. Maharaj was appointed as projects director for the Kusile project, effective from the January 23, 2020. In 2017, Maharaj left Eskom to work at the Redondo Peninsula Energy Company, in the Philippines. Eskom says the Kusile power station will be the fourth largest of its kind in the world.  Eskom spokesperson Dikhatso Mothae says, “He comes with a lot of experience, having worked at Eskom. He left Eskom for the Philippines and we have recruited him back to Eskom to head up Kusile.” “As you are aware, Kusile currently has one commercial unit operating and two have been compromised and we look forward to completing that project. We are sure that Avin will work in terms of that by 2020.”
