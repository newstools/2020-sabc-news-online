Gauteng Premier David Makhura has ordered that all school indemnity forms be revised as they are currently being used to protect one party. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi revealed this during a media briefing about the steps the department has taken following the death of 13-year-old Enock Mpianzi. The Grade 8 learner died last week during a water activity at the Parktown Boys’ High School camp in Brits in the North West. Lesufi announced that the school principal and staff at the district office have been suspended pending investigations into the incident. This after it emerged that the trip to the camp was not authorised. Lesufi says Gauteng Premier David Makhura also wants the authorisation of all water-related trips to be escalated. “All indemnity forms need to be appropriately revised, explained and where there is confusion, clarity or a guiding document be formulated. The premier is of the view that these indemnity forms are used to exonerate those that don’t execute their mandate. All water-related trips should get authorisation immediately from head office and no longer at the school or district level.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
