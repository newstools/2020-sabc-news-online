The Competition Commission has warned that schools that do not comply with the new school uniform guidelines might be prosecuted. The Commission has been in talks with School Governing Bodies to push down school uniform prices. One of the recommendations is to make the uniforms as generic as possible. Commission’s spokesperson Sipho Ngwema says they will be assessing schools this year to determine if there has been compliance. “People who do not comply with the Competition Act we will take them to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution and if they are found guilty, the Competition Tribunal imposes remedies that include large fines so the Act is specific in terms of the signs that must be imposed.”
