Charges of raping a minor and housebreaking have been added to the charge sheet of Precious Ramabulana’s alleged killer, Aubrey Manaka. The 28-year-old appeared in the Morebeng Magistrates Court, in Limpopo, for a second time on Thursday. The case was postponed to next Tuesday following an instruction from the Deputy Director of Prosecutions (DPP) for him to plea at a higher court. “One of the instructions by the DPP is that you must plead before the district court in terms of Section 199 of the Criminal Procedure Act,” said Magistrate Lebo Nchabeleng-Raburifi. “You are facing a charge of rape where it is alleged that you raped a minor child. You are going to face another charge of housebreaking with intent to rape.” Manaka is also accused of raping and stabbing 21-year-old Ramabulana, who was a Capricorn TVET College student, 52 times. He was nabbed four days after the 21-year-old’s body was found in her rented room. For more on the story watch video below:
