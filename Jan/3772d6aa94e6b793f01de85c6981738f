Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu will on Tuesday visit the Vaal Intervention Project, in Vereeniging, on a fact-finding mission regarding the progress made in the project so far. The project, lead by ERWAT (Ekurhuleni Water Care Company) seeks to clean up the Vaal River of pollution accumulated over the recent years. ERWAT came in after the army pulled out of the clean-up and rescue mission at the end of November last year. Aging infrastructure and lack of maintenance on the purification plants on the river have contributed to the less than ideal conditions. See some of the affected areas on the map below:  In some areas, raw sewage runs directly into the river leaving a health hazard for those with access to the river banks. In 2019 it was reported that the project to clean up was put on hold due to lack of funding. Watch video below for the background story:  Sisulu will be briefed on the project and its successes to date, after which she will then address the media on the project.
