The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Free State has threatened to take a farmer in the province to the Equality Court following allegations of racial discrimination against his farmworkers in Deneysville. It is alleged that workers are often subjected to hard labour as a form of punishment. Free State EFF Secretary Bosanku Msimanga says the situation at the farm needs urgent attention. “There’s a culture there in that particular farm of treating people on the basis of their race. When you commit even a small mistake you are taken to what is called Robben Island where you will wear prisoners’ clothes. You will be taken to destroy stones. Our people are being discriminated against, are being badly treated and they were beaten and even went to doctors. The same thing that has been happening during apartheid they are continuing to practice it. “
