Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will announce the results of the 2019 National Senior Certificate in Midrand, north of Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. Over 790 000 full time and part time candidates sat for the 2019 matric exams nationwide. Motshekga will start by having breakfast with the country’s top 30 achievers from public schools this morning. The class of 2018 achieved a 78.2% national past rate, which is the best since 1994. Basic Education Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says it’s all systems go. “In terms of the logistical arrangements, everything is in place. The top achieving learners are here, they’ve arrived with their parents and the minister is going to meet them to just find out from them how they’ve prepared for the exam because there’s some benefit in sharing some of their tricks and techniques of achieving at this level. The big time will be when the minister unveils the results for the class of 2019 officially on a live broadcast that will take place on SABC.” SABC 1, the SABC television news channel 404 and all radio stations will carry a live broadcast of Motshekga’s announcement of the 2019 matric results.
