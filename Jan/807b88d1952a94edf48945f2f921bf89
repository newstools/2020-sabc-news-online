The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) in the Free State and the Mangaung Metro have joined hands to assist victims of Friday’s flooding in Bloemfontein. One person was killed and several injured when heavy rain accompanied by a strong wind wreaked havoc in in the Manguang Metro. Cogta MEC Thembeni Nxangisa and Mangaung Mayor Olly Mlamleli visited the Caleb Motshabi informal settlement which was the worst affected to assess the damage. Scores of residents have been displaced by the storm and are being housed in community halls in the metro. “Obviously we can’t plan for this kind of rain stress and also the disaster that we find ourselves in today. We understand that some are staying in places that they’ve been told many times that this is a flood line area, please try to relocate but the situation needs us to work together to move forward,” says Nxangisa.
