The Automobile Association (AA) says motorists can expect a drop in the price of fuel in February. In a statement, the AA says the predictions are based on the ongoing decrease in the oil price since the second week of 2020. The AA was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. Oil has dipped to its lowest level since the start of December 2019. The AA predicts that 95 Octane petrol will drop by around 13 cents a litre, 93 Octane petrol and both grades of diesel by 4 cents. Illuminating paraffin by 3 cents per litre.
