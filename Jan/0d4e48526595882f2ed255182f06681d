Johannesburg’s City Power says its customers won’t be affected by Eskom’s load shedding over the weekend. Eskom announced earlier on Friday that it will implement Stage 2 load shedding throughout the weekend until Monday.  City Power says it has extra capacity available to ensure that the lights of its customers remain on. The Johannesburg power utility receives about 90% of its electricity from Eskom with 10% coming from the Kelvin Power Station in Johannesburg. “The extra capacity that City Power has comes from various sources, which include ripple relays. This is technology we use to switch off power guzzlers like geysers remotely without you even noticing. We have extra capacity, we can get through load limiting from your smart metres,” says City Power Spokesperson Isaac Mangena.  WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
