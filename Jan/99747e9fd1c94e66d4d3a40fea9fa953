The Eastern Cape Education Department says it will step up its responses to overcome challenges like the infrastructure backlog, sanitation and scholar transport. The province recorded the biggest increase in its matric pass rate with an improvement of more than six percentage points. No school in the province registered a zero pass rate.  The MEC for Education, Fundile Gade, says the province is heading in the right direction. “To go beyond five percent improvement tells the whole story that the department is turning the corner now and also the systems that have been put in place by our predecessors are beginning to yield outcomes that are desirable for the populace of the province. The school performance took a new turn as well as quintile one schools improving from 69.4 to 75.3 percentage.”
