The corruption case against ANC MP Bongani Bongo has been postponed to February 21 when it will be transferred to the High Court. Bongo made a second appearance in the Cape Town magistrate’s court on Friday morning. He is accused of trying to bribe a parliamentary official to derail a parliamentary hearing into state capture in 2017. Several ANC MP’s were in court to support him. They include former Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, former Northwest Premier Supra Mahumapelo and MP Alvin Botes. Zwane says Bongo has been treated unfairly. “He has been suffering from journalists sometimes not even talking to him in order to put his side of the story, and it is now becoming a norm that he is corrupt. So, we are happy that finally these cases are here and he’ll  get a chance to also put his side of the story and he should not be judged up until the finding is made.” Click on the video below:
