The World Health Organisations (WHO) has commended China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak that’s claimed more than 130 lives. More than 6 000 other people in dozens of countries around the world have been infected. The WHO was last week expected to announce whether the new virus would be made a global health emergency, but officials say they have postponed that decision to gather more data. Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme Doctor Michael Ryan briefed the media in Geneva. “With regards to the expert team that will go that team is still being pulled together but let me stress China is doing the right things and China is responding in a massive way. This team is not going to help China or assist China its to work in collaboration with Chinese experts to come to a common understanding of these issues and to ensure that the lessons being learnt, the science that is being applied and the evidence that’s being gathered is shared with the world.” Meanwhile,  Johnson & Johnson says it’s working on developing a vaccine for the new coronavirus. The company says the vaccine programme will utilise the same technologies used to make its experimental Ebola vaccine, which is currently being administered in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. The company also says it is donating its HIV drug Prezcobixto China for use in research to find a solution against the outbreak.  – Additional reporting by Reuters
