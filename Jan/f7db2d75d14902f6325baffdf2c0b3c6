Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo has called for calm following the deaths of two Lekgolo Primary School learners in Mamaila Kolobe Tona village outside Giyani. The learners died on Wednesday after a school wall collapsed on them after a food delivery truck crashed into it, and two others were critically injured. All four of the learners are from the same family. Angry community members say the wall was a safety hazard as it was cracked. Boshielo visited the school and the family of the deceased later in the afternoon. “We have brought in our social workers and psychologists to come and calm the teachers and tomorrow (Thursday) they will come and talk to the children. As for other things I would say let’s respect the families and make sure that we bury our children with the dignity that they deserve,” says Boshielo.  Watch the video below for related news:
