The State Capture Commission is to hear an application for a summons that could compel former president, Jacob Zuma to return to testify before the Commission by the end of January. The application by the Commission’s legal team for an order to authorise its acting Secretary to issue a summons for Zuma to appear will be heard next Tuesday when the inquiry into state capture resumes in Johannesburg. In a statement, the Commission says it wants Zuma to appear from the 27th to the 31st of January. Zuma failed on several occasions to appear before the Commission as scheduled, citing ill health.
