Gauteng police have arrested three armed suspects believed to have been planning to carry out a robbery at the Mall of Africa in Midrand, north of Johannesburg. The police also recovered unlicensed firearms and ammunition. They say preliminary investigations indicate that the suspects could be linked to two separate armed robbery cases in Alberton and Boksburg, east of Johannesburg. Gauteng Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters says they received information of a planned robbery where unsuspecting victims would be followed from a bank at the mall. Peters says police spotted the vehicle driving out of Mall of Africa and gave chase. He says: “A shootout ensued between the suspects and the police, the suspects’ vehicle ultimately crashed into a wall in Rabie Ridge where police cornered and arrested three suspects.” “Police recovered two unlicenced firearms, ammunition and also seized the BMW 3-series on being utilised during the commission of a crime.”
