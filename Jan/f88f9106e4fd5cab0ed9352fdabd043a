United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa says his party in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape has welcomed the proposed talks about the establishment of a new coalition government. This follows the recent discussions between the leadership of the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the UDM for a possible coalition in the beleaguered municipality. The two parties previously co-governed in the hung municipality after the 2016 local government elections. “This time around we have to have a written agreement which is going to make sure that we are not being bullied by these big parties and that any party that accuses members of the UDM of corruption, people must go to the police station or at least table the evidence in full view of the public if there is such, and that the UDM is not going to be told as to who must serve within the executive if we were to be part of a government,” says Holomisa.
