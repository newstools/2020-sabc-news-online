The Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court in the west of Johannesburg has postponed to January 22, the case of a 60-year-old man accused of the rape of three siblings. The man, who is the husband of the girls’ aunt, is said to have raped the three girls for many years. The youngest victim, who is now 15, is the one who told neighbours about the rapes which led to the arrest of the man. The suspect made a brief court appearance, however his lawyer was not present. The 60-year-old walked up to the dock in a courtroom packed with community members and activists – who kept mumbling in anger at his sight. He has been behind bars since October 2019 and was expected to apply for bail on Wednesday. However, due to the absence of his lawyer, the case was postponed. The state also indicated that they are awaiting DNA results as well as proper consultation with the three girls before the next court appearance, as the alleged rape occurred over a period of 8-10 years.
