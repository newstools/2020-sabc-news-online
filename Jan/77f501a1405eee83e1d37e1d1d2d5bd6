The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs,  Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says the country’s municipal funding model should be changed. This will be to enable smaller municipalities who do not have a revenue base to render services to the communities they serve. Dlamini-Zuma says for local government to work effectively, National Treasury will have to make sure that sufficient funds are given to district municipalities so that they can share all their expertise – including engineers and other critical professionals with smaller local municipalities. She says the recent African National Congress (ANC) Lekgotla has agreed that this must happen sooner. Click below for more information on ANC Lekgotla:
