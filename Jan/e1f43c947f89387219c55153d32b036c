Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) says calls by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and others for the removal of Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, is opportunistic. There are also reports that at the African National Congress’ (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Pretoria this weekend, suggestions of placing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) under various departments have been made. One of the suggestions made is that of Eskom being moved to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. BUSA President, Sipho Pityana, says they are confident that President Cyril Ramaphosa will make an informed and productive decision on SOEs and not act solely on impulse. “We need to be very thoughtful about this. We have had discussions with the president and appreciate the fact that he understands there must be a much more comprehensive rethink of SOEs, not an impulsive approach,” says Pityana.
