The DA says it will take immediate action to suspend the mayor of the George Municipality, Melvin Naik for his alleged involvement in corruption, fraud, maladministration and serious malpractice in the municipality. A report of an investigation by the Western Cape Local Government Minister, Anton Bredell, last week made two serious findings against individuals implicated in a corruption scandal related to the “War on Waste Project”. For nearly two years the Hawks have been investigating allegations of maladministration, fraud and corruption in the municipality. Bredell instituted his investigation in September last year. DA’s Geordin Hill-Lewis says decisive action is needed to restore the integrity of the DA administration in George. “The investigators came to a conclusion that there was serious evidence of maladministration and corruption in the George Municipality and unfortunately there was evidence that shows mayor Melvin Naik was actually involved in some of that wrongdoing, now, of course, this is not a court of law so these remain allegations we feel that the allegations are serious enough and substantial enough that we have to take proactive immediate action now.”
