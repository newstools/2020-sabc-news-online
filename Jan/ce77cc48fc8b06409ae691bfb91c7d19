Health authorities in the Eastern Cape are investigating allegations that a sick man died at Motherwell Community Health Centre in Port Elizabeth soon after he was denied entry by a security guard on duty. Seventy-two-year-old, Lizo Basil Solontsi, who was wheelchair-bound was brought to the centre with difficulties in breathing but his family allegedly stood helplessly outside the locked gate. It’s alleged for an hour his family begged the guard to get help from a nurse or doctor inside. Solontsi’s daughter, Ntombekhaya, says he was eventually attended to but died moments later. “The department is looking into the allegations and an investigation is being conducted. There are two officials that have been sent to the facility from Bhisho to do clinical investigations, check the files of the base and also what happened and also look at all the circumstances surrounding the allegations,” says health spokesperson, Sizwe Khuphelo.
