President Cyril Ramaphosa says the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)  will make Africa the largest common market in the world. Ramaphosa was delivering the keynote address at the South African Heads of Mission Conference in Pretoria. South Africa is to assume the year-long chairship of the African Union (AU) in 2020. President Ramaphosa says the Continental Free Trade Area agreement will help boost inter-Africa trade. “This Continental Free Trade Area agreement will make Africa the largest common market in the world with a population of more than a billion people and a combined GDP of over 3 trillion dollars. The Continental Free Trade Area agreement will boost inter-Africa trade, reignite industrialisation  and where countries have no successes to industrialise – it will help to catapult them to the industrial era. It will also pave the way for the meaningful integration of Africa into global value chains and the global economy.” Watch video below for more:
