The Gauteng Education Department says late registrations for Grade 1 and 8 learners will open on 15 January. Parents who have not applied can use the Department’s APP or go to the district offices to apply. The Department’s spokesperson Steve Mabona says MEC Panyaza Lesufi is currently finalising all admission appeals and parents will receive responses by 14 January. “The process will then close on the 24 January. We will not have any appeal nor objection once you have applied. Automatically, we will provisionally accommodate you in the school that you would have applied to. Only schools that have space or capacity will be availed on the system. Once they apply at an identified school they must know that provisionally, we will then place them but we will then have to wait for necessary documents that they must submit at the schools that they have applied to.”
