The SABC’s case to reverse irregular appointments in the corporation has resumed in the Labour Court. The public broadcaster wants the 28 appointments which it says violated company policy reversed but it has been challenged in court. The irregular appointments are part of former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s legacy. SABC spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo says the matter is scheduled to be concluded on Tuesday. The SABC filed an application at the Labour court on the 20th of August 2019 following the recommendations of the reports of the Public Protector and the Parliamentary Ad Hoc Committee. This matter was heard before the court for the first time on December 11 and 12, 2019 and is scheduled to be concluded January 7, 2020. Click related video below:
