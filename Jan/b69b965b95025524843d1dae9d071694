Community leaders in the Northern Cape’s Lower Orange River region have vowed to intensify their mission to expel foreign nationals suspected of dealing in drugs. A  protest against drugs has already spread to Keimoes and Kakamas. The action started last week, apparently in retaliation to the fatal stabbing of a policeman by a foreign national. Tempers ran high at the court appearance of Emmanuel Okafor who is charged with contravening the Refugee Act, assault, attempted murder and murder. He did not apply for bail and the case was postponed until the 23 March. The community says drugs are destroying them. They say they will continue to go to homes and businesses of foreign nationals to chase them away. Meanwhile, those targeted last week have still not returned to their homes and businesses. Police visibility remains high in the area.
