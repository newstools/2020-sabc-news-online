The Oudtshoorn Local Municipality in the Little Karoo says it is busy with assessments to damage caused to infrastructure and properties following Wednesday’s flash floods. Heavy wind and rain led to power outages and damage to several homes. It was mostly homes in informal settlements that were affected and some residents were temporarily relocated to a community hall. “Our emergency officers are out doing assessments. We had house roofs being blown down. Electricity cables being torn off. We are still doing assessments. We are busy with mop-up operations for the day. We grateful for the rain, but we have had some extensive damage since yesterday (Wednesday),” says Oudtshoorn Mayor Colan Sylvester.
