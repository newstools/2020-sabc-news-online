A taxi driver in KwaNongoma, northern KwaZulu-Natal, is being hailed as a hero after he assisted a woman give birth in his taxi. They were turned away from a local clinic where nurses allegedly examined the woman and told her she was not in labour. The mother and baby are doing well in hospital. KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu wants a full investigation into the hospital matter. Department spokesperson Noluthando Nkosi says they commend the humanity of the taxi driver, Nhlonipho Zuluthe. “The MEC has commended the taxi driver who bravely assisted the woman in labour who had allegedly been turned away from one of our facilities. She’s also requested the HoD Dr. Sandile Shabalala to provide an urgent report that must address the alleged misconduct in this case and indicate what consequence management measures will be applied for all those implicated in this case. The MEC furthermore says all health care practitioners need to always remember that they have a responsibility to save lives.”
