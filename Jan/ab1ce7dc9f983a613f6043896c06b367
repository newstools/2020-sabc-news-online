The University of Stellenbosch says it is serious about tackling incidents of gender-based violence on campus. It has temporarily banned the consumption and trade of alcohol at student residences. They are also not allowed to store alcohol in their rooms. University Spokesperson Martin Viljoen says management also wants to decrease incidents of binge-drinking. He says: “In light of this decision, the resident rules at Stellenbosch have to be reviewed, in particular the sections that deal with use of alcohol at residences.” “We urge our students to help us combat these difficulties,” adds Viljoen.
