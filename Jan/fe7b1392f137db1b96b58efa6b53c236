KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu says the number of schools that achieved a 100% pass rate in the national examinations has increased. He says a total number of 201 schools obtained 100% pass rate in 2019 compared to 121 schools in 2018. Included in these best schools are rural schools and under-resourced institutions on quintiles 1, 2 and 3. Speaking at the Durban ICC where the provincial top achievers’ awards ceremony took place, Mshengu says three schools in the province obtained a 0% matric pass rate.  Departmental spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi has described this as an improvement as none of these three schools were among those that received a 0% matic pass rate in 2018. Last year six KZN schools recorded a 0% pass rate. Mhlambi says: “In terms of 0% schools in 2018 there were six schools and this year we have been able to reduce them to three. When I say reduce them I say that in a context because we wanted 0% of 0% schools but through our intervention, we were able to lift those six that were in 0% in 2018. This year those schools have improved and they are above 30% plus.” Meanwhile, Mshengu says they will go beyond the call of duty to ensure that the schools with 0% pass rate move from this disappointing position. He committed to ensuring that KwaZulu-Natal never has any school that receives a 0% matric pass rate.
