A major power outage caused by an explosion at a small power sub-station in Port Elizabeth has plunged large parts of the city into darkness since Sunday night. The sub-station is said to be in Newton Park, not far from Greenacres Mall. It has resulted in SABCâ€™s Umhlobo Wenene FM being off-air, compounded by a standby generator that failed to kick in.  Radio programmes and news programmes have been affected at the station. Nelson Mandela Bay electricians are working on the line fault while technicians have been brought in to attend to the generator. Programming will resume once the problem has been fixed.
