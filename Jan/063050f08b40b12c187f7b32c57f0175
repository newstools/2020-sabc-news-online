Police Minister Bheki Cele will on Sunday visit the family of Samantha Radebe, who was shot and killed during a shootout between the police and hijacking suspects in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The 28-year old Radebe was on her way home from work when she was hit by a bullet on Wednesday. One of the suspects was also wounded in the shooting. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has not yet determined whether Radebeâ€™s death was caused by the police or one of the suspects. On Friday, the community marched to the Alexandra police station to demand answers and an arrest. Cele and Gauteng Community Saftey MEC, Faith Mazibuko, will also meet community leaders.
