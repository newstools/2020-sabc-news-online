The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West has raised concerns about the safety of learners at schools. The party says it also found no learners or teachers at the Mamoratwa Combined School in Ottosdal during their site visit to check on the school’s readiness. The school was closed by the Department of Education at the end of last year because they said it was not economical to run. DA spokesperson on Education, Gavin Edwards says they found a group of angry parents who say they were not informed that their children will be relocated to another school. “Putting them in a school they did not know or expect, putting them back in a bus and then driving them back to this point, where they get off a bus and get traumatised further by walking home in the dark at 6, 7 o’clock in the evening, these kids are only six or seven years old. I mean this is causing not only stress to the parents but severe emotional trauma to the children as well. (It is) not a great thing to experience.”
