The Abathembu Kingdom has called a mass meeting for Thursday to be attended by the amaDlomo family, traditional leaders and the general public. The meeting, to be held at Bumbane Great Place near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, is set to deal with the return of King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo after he was released from prison. Watch the video below for more on the story:  King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo was granted remission of sentence. Abathembu Kingdom Spokesperson, Minentle Joyi, says the acting King Zanelizwe Dalindyebo will be formally informing the nation about the king’s release and that the acting king will also inform the nation that he is ready to hand over the throne back to his father. “We will have a meeting where His Majesty, the  acting King Zanelizwe Dalindyebo will be informing them that His Majesty and his father, King Zwelibanzi is back from the incarceration and then inform the nation about the process that will follow, and also informing them that he is ready to hand over the throne back to his father.” King Dalindyebo’s Spokesperson, Mthunzi Ngonyama, says the King will not be attending because he cannot be invited by his son. “Yes, we heard about the meeting from other people. There was no letter to the attention of the King to come to the meeting. They have no power to do that. We do not know what the agenda is, so they cannot invite him in the first place and we do not know the agenda. So, for those reasons, we are  not coming to a meeting that we do not know the agenda.”
