The case against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Deputy President Floyd Shivambu has been postponed to February 26. This is to allow for Shivambu’s representations to dismiss the charges to be considered. Shivambu appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning. He is accused of assaulting photographer Adrian De Kock on the grounds of Parliament in 2018.  It is alleged among others, Shivambu grabbed photographer Adrian De Kock by the throat on the parliamentary precinct after the journalist asked him for comment and took a picture of him. Shivambu is one of several EFF leaders facing assault charges following attacks on various individuals. These include party leader Julius Malema, Secretary General Marshall Dlamini and spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Shivambu is also awaiting censure of Parliament’s ethics committee related to the alleged attack on De Kock.
