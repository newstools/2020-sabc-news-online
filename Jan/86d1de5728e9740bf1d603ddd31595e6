Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize, says parents of babies that are born now will be part of the national register that will indicate their eligibility for the National Health Insurance (NHI). Mkhize joined by representatives of several provincial departments, visited mothers at King Dinizulu hospital in Durban, who gave birth after midnight. He says by the time the NHI is operating, the children will be registered at birth. “About the children that are born here already, we would like them to be able to get out of here with their birth certificates. So in a number of hospitals, we are already putting that in place now. What that will mean is that in the time when we situate the National Health Insurance the children will be registered at birth but their parents will be part of a national register that will be able to indicate those who are eligible for the National Health insurance,” says Mkhize.  KwaZulu-Natal has welcomed 66 New Year’s babies into the world since midnight. The provincial health department says 34 of the babies are boys, while 32 are girls. The first baby was born at Ladysmith Provincial Hospital at midnight. The mothers are overwhelmed by the new lives they have brought into the world. The mothers were showered with gifts and hampers of baby care products and plush toys for their little ones by the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department.  -Reporting by Samkelisiwe Litchfield
