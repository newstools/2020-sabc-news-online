Allegations of bribery have surfaced at the Walter Sisulu University in the Eastern Cape. A 19-year-old prospective student has alleged that a students’ assistant at the Buffalo City campus in East London, approached her and told her she could get her admitted. The prospective student says upon exchanging contacts, she was asked to bring at least R3 000 for admission. While the identity of the person who sought a bribe is unknown, she can be heard in a voice note giving instructions to the prospective student. Voice Note: “Other things should not be mentioned on social networks, especially such things. Anyway, yes I’m here at WSU Admin. What we do is, we help students who didn’t apply get admitted at the institution. But you have to bring with you a registration fee and an extra R300 for a cold drink. R150 is mine and the other is for a person at the admin.” WSU spokesperson Yonela Thukwayo has warned prospective students to be cautious of such scams She says: “I just want to re-iterate that our system is 100% online and it is also difficult for anyone to temper with our system. So, anyone that promises you a space by paying money upfront, that is a fraudulent activity.” “The person and the prospective student can be held to account for those types of fraudulent activities,” adds Thukwayo.
