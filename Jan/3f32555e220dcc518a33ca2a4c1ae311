Eskom says the current Stage 2 load shedding is due to an unanticipated conveyor belt failure at Medupi power station. The power utility says the failure resulted in the system being severely constrained and vulnerable. Eskom began implementing the power cuts from  10 o’clock on Saturday night and they are scheduled to continue until 8 o’clock on Sunday morning. They came more than three weeks since South Africans experienced rolling power cuts. While a number of units are being brought back on line, Eskom says, it was essential to implement rotational load shedding. It says its teams continue to work tirelessly to return units back from planned and unplanned outages. Watch related video below for more on the story:
