The Free State Education Department says it will investigate allegations that a school principal assaulted a teacher at Lephola Secondary School in Welkom. This follows a social media post in which a teacher is seen with blood all over his face. The alleged assault is said to have happened in the principal’s office. The department has condemned the incident. “We take this thing in a serious light. We want to send a message that our schools should not be a boxing ring. Our schools should be a center of quality learning and teaching for our children” says Free State Education Department spokesperson Howard Ndaba.
