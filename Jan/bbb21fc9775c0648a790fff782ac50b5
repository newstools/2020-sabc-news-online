Deputy President David Mabuza claims President Cyril Ramaphosa was misled by the Eskom board and Minister of Public Enterprise Pravin Gordhan on issues of load shedding. President Ramaphosa assured South Africans that there would be no load shedding before 13 January, after the December load shedding. Stage 2 outages returned to South Africans on Saturday. Mabuza, who was doing a walkabout at Diamond Pavilion Mall in Kimberley ahead of the ANC birthday celebrations on Saturday, says he will meet with the new Eskom GCEO, André de Ruyter, in the coming week. “Well, they’ve misled the President. But right from the day when we went there with the President, I insisted on the problem of Eskom maintenance of these power stations.  it’s very important. You can’t say there won’t be any load shedding if there’s no effective maintenance of these power generation plants. So the problem that is facing Eskom is the maintenance.”
