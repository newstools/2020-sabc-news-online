The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Friday it will review a petition asking the agency to formally investigate 500 000 Tesla Inc vehicles over sudden unintended acceleration reports. Tesla did not immediately comment Friday. Many of the complaints report sudden acceleration incidents when attempting to park vehicles in a garage or at a curb. Others claimed the sudden acceleration happened while in traffic or when using driver assistance systems and led to crashes. In one complaint, a driver said a 2015 Tesla Model S 85D in California was closed and locked when he claimed “a few moments later the vehicle started accelerating forward towards the street and crashed into a parked car.” A Tesla driver in Avondale, Pennsylvania, was pulling into a parking spot at an elementary school when the vehicle accelerated on its own, the complaint said adding: “It went over a curb and into a chain link fence.” Another complaint said a Tesla driver in Andover, Massachusetts was approaching her garage door “when the car suddenly lurched forward: and “went through the garage door destroying two garage doors.” The Tesla stopped when it hit the garage’s concrete wall. The 2,000 vehicles covered by the September petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. A lawyer who filed the petition, Edward Chen, told Reuters in October that he strongly believes “this number is much larger than 2,000.” The review is ongoing. Last week, NHTSA said it was probing the December 29 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA’s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company’s so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.
