Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to take urgent and decisive action against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan for what it terms failure to address problems at Eskom. Cosatu spokesperson, Sizwe Pamla, says Gordhan is also failing to implement Eskom’s turnaround strategy. Pamla says they have lost confidence in Gordhan and are worried that members of the Eskom board are clueless on what their responsibilities are. “The results show that minister Pravin Gordhan has not delivered on what we expected him to, in terms of fixing the SOE’s. The AG still paints a gloomy of the SOE’s. Many of them are still failing; I mean PRASA is still failing millions of South Africans. Also if you look at Eskom, the economy is still struggling because of load shedding. Even if you look at the Airline, it has deteriorated to a point where it is handed to business rescue. This is a worst case scenario where we allow all these SOE’s to implode. If we are to avert it, we need to act and act now,” says Pamla. Watch related videos below:
