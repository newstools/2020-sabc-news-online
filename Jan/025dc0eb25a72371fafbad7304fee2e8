The Department of Public Enterprises says it is still talking to National Treasury on the need to urgently raise funds for South African Airways (SAA). Meanwhile, the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) called on government to act swiftly in providing funding for the troubled airline. SACCA has also reiterated its call for proper leadership at SAA. This after SAA cancelled some of its local and international flights, saying the decision was aimed at saving cash and optimising the airline’s position ahead of further capital injection.  The government promised SAA the cash injection when the airline was placed under voluntary business rescue in December. “We need proper leadership at SAA. We need government to come in and fund the airline as promised when they undertook to voluntary business rescue. You cannot sit, how many days were we told by the business practitioner last week Friday? We were told by Sunday that if we don’t get that money such things will happen. And yesterday we saw a statement from SAA saying that should there be any cancellations, they will inform the public. Today it’s all over the news that flights are cancelled, no one knew, as stakeholders we didn’t know, so something has to change and this wishy-washy attitude by government needs to change,” says SACCA President Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi.
