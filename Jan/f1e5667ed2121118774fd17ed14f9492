Parliament says it has given the public enough notice for the process to amend section 25 of the Constitution to expropriate land without compensation to be considered fair. It says it won’t extend the deadline for written submissions on the amended draft Bill. The deadline for interested parties to submit their input is January 31, 2020. Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee of the National Assembly Mathole Motshekga says they won’t accept any further delays to the process. “This process started in the fifth Parliament. It is a continuation and the process that started during the fifth parliament was given wide publicity before the festive season and we have also announced a time table which shows that South Africans will be given sufficient time to make inputs. So only people who want to make excuses to delay the process are making these claims so the process is continuing. We are not considering and we are not going to consider any extension,” says Motshekga. The committee was established to initiate and introduce legislation to amend the property clause of the Constitution.
