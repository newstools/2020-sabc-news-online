The South African government has expressed concern over the escalating tension in Iraq. It’s calling for calm in the Middle East following the killing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards leader General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was killed near the Baghdad airport in Iraq on Friday morning in an airstrike ordered by US President Donald Trump. International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor says the latest developments have far reaching ramifications not only for the region, but also for international peace and security. She’s reaffirmed statement of the United Nations Security Council, which “called for maximum restraint and urged all to refrain from violence or the destruction of critical infrastructure”. Responding to the developments, Pandor stated, “It is crucial for all sides to remain calm and desist from taking any further action that will exacerbate the already fragile situation. South Africa emphasises its principled view that conflicts should be resolved through political dialogue rather than resorting to the use of force”. South Africa reiterates the United Nations Security Council’s support for the “independence, sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and prosperity of Iraq”. Watch related videos below:
