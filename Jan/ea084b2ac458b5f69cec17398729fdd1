Police officer Bonginkosi Malinga – who is accused of shooting and killing his girlfriend and another man will know his fate on Tuesday – as he appears at the KaBokweni Magistrate Court in Mpumalanga. Malinga has been charged with two cases of murder and one of attempted murder. He shot and killed his girlfriend, Goodness Mhaule, and a man known as Sibusiso Khoza after he found them having a conversation and allegedly kissing in a car. During his bail application, Malinga alleged that he fired towards the two in self defence because Khoza pulled the trigger first. On Monday, his case was postponed because his legal team did not arrive in court. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi says Malinga has since been suspended from work and internal investigations are under way.
