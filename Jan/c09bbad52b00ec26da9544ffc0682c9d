Police have seized counterfeit goods to the value of R5 million following a multi-disciplinary operation in shops around the Durban CBD. Five people, including an undocumented foreigner, were arrested. The seized items include fake cosmetic products and cigarettes. KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner Khombinkosi Jula has warned those who trade in counterfeit goods. “We are very worried about the amount of stuff that is being sold out to the communities, which is portrayed as to be of a different product or brand and the problem with this is that some of these products are, for an example, fake creams that are being used by people on their skin and it can have a damaging effect on them. And in certain instances in terms of clothing itself, people are buying and paying an amount that is not worth the product that they are actually buying.”
