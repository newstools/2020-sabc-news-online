A Gauteng man is accusing Ekurhuleni Metro Police Officers of assaulting him, breaking his arm and then laying false charges against him. Bonginkosi Biyase says the incident happened on New Year’s Eve when he and his wife went to a shop in Kempton Park, in Ekurhuleni, to buy fireworks. He alleges that officers entered the shop demanding documentation for the fireworks in his possession. Biyase was told to return the fireworks because he didn’t have a permit for them. After complying, he says they were ordered out of the shop and all hell broke lose after he protested, explaining that he was still waiting for his money from the seller.
