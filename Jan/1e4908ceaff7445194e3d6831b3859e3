Police in Diepsloot north of Johannesburg are on high alert following a protest by hundreds of residents early on Thursday morning. Outraged residents took to the streets in protest following the killing of a police officer last week. The 54-year-old Detective Oupa Matjie was killed on Friday while tracing suspects wanted in a case of attempted murder and house robbery. Four suspects have since been arrested. Some roads in the area are still blockaded with burnt tyres and rubble and motorists are finding it difficult to navigate the township. Residents say they are frustrated about the high crime rate in the area and they are demanding urgent intervention. They are also calling on Police Minister Bheki Cele to meet with them to discuss solutions to reduce high crime rates in the area.
