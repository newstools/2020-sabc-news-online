The Independent Examinations Board (IEB) CEO Anne Oberholzer has congratulated the matriculants who passed the 2019 matric exams. All candidates who passed achieved a pass that will help them qualify to get access to a tertiary institute, but there’s a slight decrease from the 2018 pass rate of 98.92% as the 2019 pass stands at 98.82%.  About 11 818 full-time and 779 part-time candidates from 227 examination centres across Southern Africa wrote the exams. IEB candidates who are unhappy about their results have until January 13 to apply for re-marking. On Tuesday, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to announce the pass rate for the National Senior Certificate (NSC) results in Midrand. A total of 790405 matriculants sat for 147 question papers in 7416 examination centres across the country. Motshekga will host a breakfast with the top achievers this morning before announcing the pass rate to the nation. Another 212 candidates wrote their exams at correctional facilities.
