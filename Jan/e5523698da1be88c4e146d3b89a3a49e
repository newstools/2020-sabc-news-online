The South African Medical Association (SAMA) says the failure to implement recommendations following an audit on safety in health facilities has led to continued incidents of crime and violence. It says security audits were conducted across the country in 2016 and recommendations were made. However, they have not been implemented. SAMA spokesperson, Angelique Coetzee,Â  says the issue of safety and security affects both public and private health facilities. She was speaking following the death of a patient at the Clairwood Hospital in Durban on Friday evening. It noted that about 95% of those safety recommendations have been not implemented by the hospital.
