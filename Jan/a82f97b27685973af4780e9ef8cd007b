More than 2 million people have visited Durban since the start of the festive season. This has given the local economy an R2.7 billion boost. eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda says this exceeds previous years. Kaunda says the rise in tourism revenue is attributed to the city’s preparations ahead of the festive period. “As the eThekwini municipality, we are more than happy, looking at the economic spin-offs during this festive season compared with the previous festive season. We have done tremendous work and we are contributing since the festive season started about R2.7 billion to the economy of the country. We are more than happy that people are behaving themselves during this festive season.” Click on the video below:
