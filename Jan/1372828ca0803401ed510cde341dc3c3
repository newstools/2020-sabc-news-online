Students at the North West University‘s Mahikeng Campus have defied an instruction by the management to vacate the campus by 3pm on Tuesday afternoon. Students were instructed to leave the premises after allegations that some students were assaulted and university property was damaged on Monday night. The students shut down the campus on Monday as part of the South African University Student Union (SAUS)’s call for a seven day national shutdown of all public universities. The students remain unshaken by the university decision, as the EFF Student Command Secretary Katlego Kgosimore, explains. “No student is going to vacate the Campus. If they want us to vacate the campus they must come and instruct bouncers to remove us.” The Student Representative Council had earlier on refuted claims that they have caused havoc at the institutions campus on Monday night. The shutdown is expected to continue throughout the week. Click below for related videos…
