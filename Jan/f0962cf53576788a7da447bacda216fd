The Eastern Cape Provincial government is intensifying its battle against Gender-Based Violence (GBV). A multi-sectoral steering committee that will focus on communities severely affected has been established. The committee is in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call for rapid response teams to GBV and femicide. The committee is set to implement a 100 day rapid response approach to speed up the turnaround time of reported cases. The multi-sectoral committee led by Social Development MEC, Siphokazi Mani-Lusithi, will ensure recourse for victims and follow-up on the arrest and prosecution of perpetrators. “We are mobilising men, mobilizing stakeholders and women so that people don’t get used to doing wrong things. We don’t want aggression in the name of love. Women must not succumb to wrong things that are done by men and women cannot protect themselves. Femicides most of the time happen in the bedrooms but we want everyone to be vigilant around this. Women and children must be protected at all material times,” says Eastern Cape Premier, Oscar Mabuyane. The program has the support of the United Nations. A ward-based approach has been adopted and it will see all members of the society play a role in curbing GBV.
