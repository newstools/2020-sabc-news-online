The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Zingiswa Losi has called for the resignation of the entire Eskom board, following the resignation of its chairperson Jabu Mabuza on Friday. Mabuza resigned after admitting that he had failed to keep his promise that there would be no load shedding before January 13, 2020. Earlier, Deputy President David Mabuza said the Eskom board and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan had misled President Cyril Ramaphosa. Speaking to the SABC on the sidelines of the ANC fundraising gala dinner in Kimberley in the Northern Cape on Friday night, the labour federation’s president Losi said the entire Eskom board must go because it had failed the nation. SAFTU general-secretary Zwelinzima Vavi agrees with Losi. “Was it not the Minister of Public Enterprises who we saw holding live press conferences inside Eskom next to Jabu Mabuza, the chairperson who has just resigned now, telling the country that they have turned the corner. We think that the issue of accountability must extend beyond just Jabu Mabuza resigning, to the entire board of Eskom, to the Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan – who we hope will find it within his conscious to step down.”  ‘Mabuza’s apology laudable’ Meanwhile, the ANC has described as laudable Mabuza’s apology for his failure to keep a promise he made that there would be no load shedding before January the 13th this year. ANC national spokesperson Dakoto Legoete says,  “As the African National Congress, we note the resignation of Mr. Mabuza and we hope that will assist Eskom in getting it into a better position. Because it has become very clear that other related deployments particularly in SOEs, you need skills. So, the resignation of Mr. Mabuza, we need to commend him because it shows honesty from his side.” Ramaphosa has assured South Africans that the government is working to restore stability at Eskom and ensure its capability to deliver energy.
