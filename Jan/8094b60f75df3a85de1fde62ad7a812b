Telecommunications regulatory body ICASA has warned cellphone users to lodge complaints with their mobile operators should they suspect anything irregular on their cellphones. This follows an increase in cellphone numbers that are being illegally ported without the owners’ consent. ICASA spokesperson, Paseka Maleka, says consumers can lodge a formal complaint with ICASA if they are not happy with the network operator’s response. “ICASA has noted the complaints by members of the public that their numbers have been ported without their consent. What we are encouraging consumers to do is to first go to the network operators and lodge a formal complaint just to find the reasons why their numbers were ported. As soon as they are not happy with the response or they did not get the response at all, they can simply go to ICASA and lodge their formal complaint there so that ICASA can be able to investigate this matter further.”
