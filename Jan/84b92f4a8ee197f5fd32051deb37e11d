The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus  outbreak  a global health emergency. Briefing the media on Thursday, the WHO called on countries to work together to deal with the outbreak. The virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December has so far claimed 170 lives. More than 7 000 others have been infected.  The WHO says countries with weak health systems should be supported and that knowledge about the virus should be shared. The organisation has, however, warned that misinformation about the virus should be avoided.  Earlier on Thursday, the WHO proposed that 2019-nCoV as the interim name of the virus.
