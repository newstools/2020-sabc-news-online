Members of the media and parents of former Parktown Boys’ High School learners have been kicked out of a meeting that is under way at Wits University’s Education Campus in Johannesburg. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is engaging parents following the death of 13-year-old Enock Mpianzi who drowned at a school camp. One of the parents that was kicked out, Michelle Hobkirk, has accused the SGB of trying to cover-up. “I’m an ex SGB member of Parktown Boys’ High. I’m extremely concerned about the code of silence; first of all, the media being asked to leave. This should be open and transparent, the community want answers. And this is to discuss the SGB who is to enforce child safety policies. How did this child die? We know he drowned, but why did he die? The SGB needs to answer. We need a new SGB actually that is transparent, honest and non-captured.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:  Earlier on Friday, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said preliminary investigations revealed many inconsistencies that have forced his department to suspend the principal of Parktown Boys’ High School. Investigations revealed that the school went on an unauthorized Grade 8 camp at the Nyathi Lodge in the North West. This is where Mpianzi died during a water activity last week. The school did not comply with the department’s policy, which requires schools to apply for authorisation from the district three months before the proposed trip. The school only applied in November for the January trip.  Lesufi also announced that some district officials would also be suspended. Lesufi appointed an independent firm to investigate what led to Mpianzi’s death.
