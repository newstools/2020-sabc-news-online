Former President Jacob Zuma won’t be able to assist the Zondo Commission until March. That’s according to his legal representatives who say Zuma is receiving medical treatment from outside the country. The commission’s legal team has, for now, abandoned their mission to subpoena the former president. But the Commission and Zuma’s lawyers agreed that the arguments be heard at a later stage. The State Capture Inquiry resumed on Tuesday morning. Zuma was top of the agenda at the first sitting of the State Capture Commission for the year 2020. The Commission’s legal team was on a mission to subpoena the former president to return before the Zondo commission. Evidence leader Paul Pretorius expressed the urgency of Zuma’s return to the witness stand. But Zuma’s lawyers argued that it was unfair to summon the former president while he was still receiving medical treatment. Zuma’s lawyer Thabani Masuku says: “I would urge this Commission particularly the leaders of the legal team to extend to us and our client the presumption of integrity.” But the former president Zuma’s name remains centre of the Commission. Former spokesperson in the presidency, Simons Brent made a second appearance at the inquiry. He revealed that the former president lied to Parliament when he said he never asked anyone to assist his family members. The Commission also heard evidence around the controversial Waterkloof landing of the Gupta family’s Sun City wedding party in 2013. The Commission will continue on Wednesday. Click video below:
