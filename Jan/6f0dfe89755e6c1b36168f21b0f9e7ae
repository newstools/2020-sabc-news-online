The Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality has called for a full investigation into what exactly caused the collapse of a ceiling at the Central Park Shopping Centre in Bloemfontein. Fourteen shoppers were injured when a ceiling fell on them. One of the injured sustained an ankle fracture. Metro spokesperson Qondile Khedama says the city’s planning team will be waiting for a report from a qualified structural engineer on the cause of the collapse. “We realised that it is only a small portion of the ceiling that had collapsed. We have requested them to compile a report. Our inspectors have also done their part but we will need a report that will give us assurance from the structure point of view that the mall is habitable.  We also interacted with the interstate bus and they assured us that the services will not be interrupted. So passengers are allowed to use public transport in the form of a bus and taxis.” Click below for more on the story:
