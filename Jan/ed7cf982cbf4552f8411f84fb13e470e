The former president of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has described the late Soweto businessman, Richard Maponya, as someone who created opportunities for success. He was speaking earlier at Maponya’s funeral service, at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Soweto Campus. Maponya was buried on Tuesday afternoon at the Westpark Cemetery. Dignitaries, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, former heads of state and ministers, attended the special official funeral, category two. Buthelezi told mourners that Maponya’s legacy would live on. “Dr Maponya cared about politics, but politics was never his first love. His passion was of course business and that is where he truly excelled.” “The legacy he created is visible, as one travels through Soweto. The evidence of Dr Maponya’s legacy is not only visible in the buildings and infrastructure, but in the spirit of entrepreneurship which he built.” “To say he was successful would downplay his achievements. It is one thing to take advantage of opportunities that exist, but it is another to create opportunities where there are none.” Click video below:
