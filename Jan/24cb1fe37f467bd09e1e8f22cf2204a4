The fraud and corruption case involving former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has been adjourned to the 16th of April at the Durban Magistrate’s Court. The State will then be expected to provide an update on investigations. The court did not grant the State’s earlier request for a six-month adjournment as per its application. Gumede and 22 co-accused are facing charges relating to a Durban Solid Waste tender. It is alleged that service providers were paid inflated amounts of money even though they did not render any service to the municipality. A large group of Gumede’s supporters were present at court.
