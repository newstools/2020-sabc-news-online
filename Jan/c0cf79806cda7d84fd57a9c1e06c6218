Gauteng Police Commissioner Elias Mawela has refuted allegations that police did not respond swiftly to the deadly New Year’s Day shooting in Melville, Johannesburg. Mawela says law enforcement officials were out in their numbers on New Year’s Eve and it was an extremely busy night.  The Gauteng police boss says investigations are continuing and police are following up on a number of leads regarding the shooting which left two people dead and six others wounded, two critically.  One of the wounded is well-known actor, Mortimer Williams. Police have rubbished reports of a third death in the tragedy. Mawela says Melville residents and eyewitnesses have been extremely helpful in the investigation. “Now remember during that time of the night you’ll know that our communications system will be clogged also the network won’t be favourable but I can assure the people we were all over. Including myself I was on duty the whole night so we were around there, the response by the police, it was reasonable because we did have police officers around that particular vicinity all of us we were on duty.” Watch related videos below:
