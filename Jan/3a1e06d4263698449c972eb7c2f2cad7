Bomb experts have conducted a search at private doctorsâ€™ offices in the capital Nairobi following a bomb scare. Nairobi Area police boss Philip Ndolo says a notice dropped near the building yesterday prompted the search. Reports say that the note was claiming that the building would be bombed at any time. Officers from the Anti-Terror Police Unit cordoned off the area near the building and only residents were being allowed in. Kenya is on high-security alert following several militant group al-Shabaab attacks at the beginning of the year. Click on the video below:
