The granddaughter of former President Nelson Mandela, Ndileka, has described the late iconic businessman Dr Richard Maponya as an inspiration to the South African youth. She was speaking at the Maponya residence ahead of the funeral. Maponya passed away last Monday at the age of 99. His funeral service will take place at the University of Johannesburg Soweto Campus from 8 o’clock this morning. He will be buried at Joburg’s Westpark Cemetery – in a Special Official Funeral Category 2. Ndileka Mandela says despite humble beginnings, both Maponya and her grandfather made great contributions throughout their lives. “Dr Maponya contributed a lot towards the development of black business and he is the very epitome, I call him the grandfather of black entrepreneurs. He contributed a lot towards the upliftment of a lot of people in the country. I am sure his contribution will linger on for generations – to say to a black child that it is possible. When you see where they came from, both him and granddad, they came from humble beginnings and look at what they achieved during their lifetime. It just goes on to show it is not what you are given in life, it is what you make out of the life you are given.”
