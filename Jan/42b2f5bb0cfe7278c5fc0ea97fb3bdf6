More than 10 000 learners have been placed at schools in Gauteng on Wednesday during the late registration period. The department of education says parents of learners not yet placed should apply online or visit the provincial office or district offices. The late application process will close on the 24th of January. Departmental spokesperson, Steve Mabona says, “This is the system that went very well on the first day of late registration. We know that we had many parents going to our offices. Parents can still continue to go to our offices for assistance for the late registration because we know some of them don’t have the means to do so. We have over 15 districts and many of our decentralised offices and the provincial offices assisting with the applications.” Watch related video below:
