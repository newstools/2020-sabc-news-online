The African National Congress (ANC) says it has reclaimed eight of the nine wards in Wednesday’s by-elections in Mamusa in the North West. The Schweizer Reneke-based municipality was dissolved in October last year because of financial mismanagement and failure to deliver basic services. The ANC’s Hlomane Chauke says they are happy that they have managed to retain those wards. Erns Kleynhans of the Freedom Front Plus says they have won one ward. Eight political parties and one independent candidate contested the by-elections. The Independent Electoral Commission  is yet to release the final results.
