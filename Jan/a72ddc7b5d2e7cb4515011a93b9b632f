The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Limpopo Chairperson Jossey Buthane, African National Congress (ANC) member of parliament Boy Mamabolo and a third person have been arrested for malicious damage to property and theft. The charges relate to an incident in which a shack was burnt and a house damaged when Seshego residents, near Polokwane, went to some houses in search of alleged gang members. They were reacting to the arrest of a 17-year-old suspected gang member, who allegedly killed Thoriso Kgomo. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says the case against Buthane, Mamabolo and Motladi Setsiba has been postponed to March 6. Two cellphones, a router and clothing were also allegedly stolen. The three suspects briefly appeared in Seshego Magistrate Court on Monday and were released on R500 bail each.
