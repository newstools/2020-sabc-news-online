The Basic Education Department says it expects the 2020 school year to get off to a smooth start as public schools opens on Wednesday. Some Grade 1 and 8 learners in Gauteng however are still waiting to be placed in schools. The department says it expects learning and teaching to start promptly in KwaZulu-Natal where 81 schools were damaged by heavy rains during the festive season. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will on Wednesday morning visit primary schools in Bela Bela, Limpopo – while her deputy Reginah Mhaule will be at Havenview Secondary School in Pinetown, KwaZulu-Natal. Department Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says: “We are convinced that in the majority of the schools, learning and teaching will commence promptly when schools start.” “A problem is in KZN where we have those 81 schools which were damaged during the heavy rain that fell there several weeks ago, so the learners in those schools will be provided with mobile classrooms for learning to start on day one.”
