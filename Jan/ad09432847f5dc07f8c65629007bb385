Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Faith Mazibuko has called on the community of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, to remain calm and allow Independent Police Investigative Directorate to investigate the fatal shooting of a woman on Wednesday. Samantha Radebe was hit during crossfire between police and a hijacking suspect who is currently in police custody. Another bystander was critically wounded. The community marched to the Alexandra Police Station to demand answers and the arrest of the officer they alleged to have killed Radebe. “The MEC is requesting that the community exercise restraint while it is being established as to whose firearm shot and killed the deceased. The MEC would like to assure the community of Alexandra that if it is found that the bullet that killed Radebe was fired by the officer, the law will take its course without fear or favour, and appropriate action will be taken,” says Gauteng Community Safety spokesperson Pinkie Numa.
