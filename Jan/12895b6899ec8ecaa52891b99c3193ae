The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and the family of Enoch Mpianzi, have jumped over the main gate of the Nyati Bush campsite to gain access to it. This after they were denied entry into the facility earlier on Tuesday to conduct an inspection. Thirteen-year-old Mpianzi drowned in the Crocodile River at the campsite last week. The Parktown Boys’ High School learner was attending a grade 8 orientation camp at the facility when he was swept away by the river. SAHRC Gauteng Manager, Buang Jones, says they want the police to issue a warrant of arrest for the owner. “The owner has not granted us access, the gate is still locked. We are told by the manager that the owner is consulting her lawyers. We have asked the SAPS to consider issuing a warrant of arrest because they have obstructed and interfered with our lawful investigations as a Chapter 9 body. The conduct of the owner amounts to a criminal offense from the proper reading of our act,” says Jones. Watch a related video below:
