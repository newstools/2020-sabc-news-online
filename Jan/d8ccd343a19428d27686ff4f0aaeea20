There is exactly one week left before the closing date for public comment and written submissions on the draft Constitution 18th Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow expropriation of land without compensation. The Bill was first published in the Government Gazette on the 13th of December last year and will run until the end of January. The deadline for written submissions and for the National House of Traditional Leaders to make input on the bill expired next week. It is referred to as the Constitution 18th Amendment Bill, because it will be the 18th time that the South African Constitution is being amended. The Bill states that it seeks “to ensure that the right to property may be limited in such a way that, where land is expropriated for land reform, the amount of compensation may be nil”. The deadline for public comment on the bill is looming, the National House of Traditional Leaders says it has written to Parliament for it to officially refer the  Bill to it and to extend the deadline. The House of Traditional Leaders which says the Bill was never officially referred to it,  is empowered  in terms of the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act to give input on the bill.
