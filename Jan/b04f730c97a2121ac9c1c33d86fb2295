The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, will on Tuesday continue to hear evidence of how some government officials in KwaZulu-Natal allegedly benefited from corrupt deals when PricewaterhouseCoopers forensic auditor Trevor White returns to the stand. Politically-connected businessman Toshan Panday is alleged to have bought gifts and bribed police staff in the province’s supply chain management. Panday also allegedly received R47 million from police in the province from November 2009 to August 2010 in a move in which procurement procedures were flouted. White explained to the commission how accommodation for SAPS staff during the World Cup in some instances was. In some instances, Panday’s company would bill twice and charge higher than inflated prices. Click related video below:
