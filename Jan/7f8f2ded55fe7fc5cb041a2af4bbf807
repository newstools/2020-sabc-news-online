Three people have been arrested in Ventersburg in the Free State after they were allegedly found in possession of stolen antiretroviral (ARVs) tablets. Members of the Welkom Tactical Response Team found 265 bottles of ARVs after they stopped and searched the vehicle the suspects were travelling in on Saturday. The three were arrested after they allegedly failed to provide documentation that the police had asked for. They will appear in the Ventersburg Magistrate’s court soon. This is a second arrest related to the alleged theft of ARVs in the Free State this week. On Friday, a health official and another suspect were arrested in Bloemfontein after they were found in possession of R1.2 million worth of ARVs. The police said they were  investigating the possibility of a syndicate operating in the provincial Department of Health that steals and sells antiretrovirals.
