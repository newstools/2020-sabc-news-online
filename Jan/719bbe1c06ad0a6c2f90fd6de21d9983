The Parktown Boys’ High School Governing Body (SGB) has finally reacted to the death of Grade 8 learner Enock Mpianzi. He drowned last week during a school orientation camp at the Nyati Bush Lodge near Brits in North West. His disappearance was only reported a day after the incident and his body was found the next day. The school’s SGB says it has been traumatised by the devastating passing of Mpianzi. The school has welcomed the intervention of Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. It says it will remain in communication with the MEC regarding further steps. Lesufi earlier announced that he will host a media briefing to give out fresh information that could be damning to some of the school staff who were at the camp when the incident occurred. A learner, who was also at the camp, has apparently told police that staff ignored them when they reported that Mpianzi was missing. The SGB says it will play its part in ensuring that they get to the bottom of the tragedy. Meanwhile, the EFF has added its voice to calls for justice for young Mpianzi. Addressing the family on Wednesday, party leader Julius Malema said that government, the school and the camp facility where Mpianzi died, must be held accountable. Malema says the EFF will offer free legal services to the family. Click below for more on the story:
