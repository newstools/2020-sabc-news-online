A 40-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Bafokeng Magistrates’ Court in Tlhabane in the North West on Tuesday in connection with the alleged kidnapping and murder of a 15-year-old girl. It is alleged that the suspect was seen leaving a local tavern in Chaneng village outside Phokeng in the company of the victim and her 18-year-old friend on Christmas Eve. He allegedly raped them at his home. On New Year’s Eve, the suspect was again seen with the 15-year-old victim walking into the bushes near the same tavern. The body of the 15-year-old was discovered in the bushes this past Sunday at Chaneng village.
