The Free State Education Department says it remains optimistic that the sacrifices that teachers and parents have made will yield positive results. This as the 2019 NSC matric results are set to be released on Wednesday. The province hopes to reclaim its number one spot, which it lost to Gauteng in 2018. Free State Education Department spokesperson Howard Ndaba maintains that they focused on quality over quantity for the class of 2019. “I think it is important to note that as the province we are really not obsessed with being number one. At the beginning of the year we have set ourselves a target of 90% pass rate and 40% bachelors which is quality passes owing to our intervention to the support that we have received from learners, from parents and contribution of other stakeholders,” says Ndaba.
