Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to give a keynote address at a function to mark National Police Day in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape on Monday.  The day celebrates the meticulous contribution of men and women in blue and pays homage to those among them who have died in the line of duty. Cabinet approved the day in 2005. It is observed annually on January 27. Minister Cele has praised the serving police service members for their contribution. “The majority of men and women in blue are good people that have sent a lot of criminals in prison and that make our communities stay safe. That is why we are simply saying ‘thank you’ to the members of the South African Police Service and we will walk together on these matters and also inviting the community to be part of that.”
