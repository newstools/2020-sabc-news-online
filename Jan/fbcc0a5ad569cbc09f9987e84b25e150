Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi will visit the family of the Jabulile Secondary School principal Emmanuel Tshivhase, who was recently gunned down at Orange Farm south of Johannesburg. It is alleged that Tshivhase, 53, was shot inside his vehicle after he had stopped on the side of the Golden Highway to answer his cell phone last week. Earlier Lesufi said he was disturbed by the incident, especially since it came in the midst of preparations for the re-opening of schools. Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “The visit is to just facilitate a process and to pay condolences. Officials did go to the family and the MEC felt that he also needs to visit the family accordingly.” The police have opened a case  and are investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder.
