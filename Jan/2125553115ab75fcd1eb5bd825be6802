Gauteng Cogta MEC Lebogang Maile has warned municipalities that he will not hesitate to replicate what he has done in the City of Tshwane and Johannesburg elsewhere. Maile suspended City of Johannesburg Speaker Vasco da Gama and City of Tshwane Speaker Katlego Rachel Mathebe on Thursday for three and six months respectively. Announcing his decision, Maile said he suspended the two in their capacity as councillors and says the move is part of his plan to improve the running of dysfunctional municipalities. He said, “I can assure you now that there is no municipality that is going to survive our wrath especially if it’s not doing its work. It doesn’t matter if it’s an African National Congress-led municipality, [there will be] serious ramifications and implications for some of my comrades in the ANC because if they do the same as these two councillors, we must act.”
