The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, has heard that Transnet’s general manager Mboniso Sigonyela instructed the company’s internal communications team to advertise in the now-defunct Gupta owned The New Age newspaper. Internal Communications Specialists for Transnet Group Joseph Jackson says they were instructed to advertise in the New Age newspaper without any explanation. The commission this week looked at evidence related to how some state-owned entities spent millions of rand on advertising contracts with the newspaper. Jackson says Sigonyele had reprimanded him and told him that he would be fired if he did not follow instructions. “He made it clear that it must be done, he gave no reasons why the adverts should be placed on the New Age…Not all; specifically recruitment and tender which I had oversight on and all had to be advertised in the New Age.” WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
