Ten newborn babies have died at the Tembisa Hospital in the past two months  following an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumonia. The Gauteng Health Department says 17 babies contracted the infection at the hospital’s neonatal ward between November and December and 10 have died. Overcrowding has been highlighted as the main reason behind the infection. The neonatal ward has a capacity to admit 44 newborns but currently has 90 babies. This specific bacteria Klebsiella pneumonia is very difficult to treat since it is resistant to most antibiotics. It can cause infections in a child’s blood and lungs leading to pneumonia and meningitis – which are deadly if left untreated. The department has highlighted overcrowding and staff shortage as some of the reasons behind the spread of the bacteria. It says more nurses have been deployed and new admissions will be diverted to Kalafong and Steve Biko Academic hospitals.  Watch related video below:
