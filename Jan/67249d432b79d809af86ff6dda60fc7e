Nearly an hour after the Tshwane Special council meeting started it reached a stalemate. The Speaker of the Tshwane metro council, Katlego Mathebe, denied the request of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and African National Congress (ANC) to meet with her to discuss the agenda of the special council meeting. The two parties want to remove the Democratic Alliance (DA) leadership in the council through motions of no confidence. The EFF and ANC claims that since they petitioned for the special council meeting their proposed agenda should be followed. Mathebe allegedly changed the order of the agenda points. The ANC’s Aaron Maluleka says they will not accept a changed agenda. “We are not going to allow you to proceed with this meeting until you engage us as petitioners. This is our meeting this is not your meeting. In our letter, we prescribe an agenda. Where did you get the motions? The Motions were in the letter. The Agenda is in the letter of how to go about the business. We say we want to engage you now. We won’t proceed with this meeting until you engage with the petitioners, it’s EFF and ANC,” says Maluleka.
