The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will know early next month if its request for an extension will be granted. The inquiry lodged an application in the High Court in Pretoria for an order to extend its lifespan from the end of February to 31 December 2020. The Commission was established following the then Public Protector Thuli Madonsela‘s recommendation that a judicial commission of inquiry be set up to investigate former president Jacob Zuma‘s dealings with the Gupta family. Shortly after the inquiry was established, it became clear that the initially scheduled time of six months would not be enough and a further 18 months was then set aside for the inquiry to finish its work. If granted, this will be a second extension. The matter will be heard on 11 February. Meanwhile, the commission has heard about corruption in the KwaZulu-Natal Police Services through the testimony of retired Colonel Johannes van Loggerenberg. At the centre of his testimony, is how politically-connected businessman Toshen Panday evaded prosecution despite strong evidence of fraud and corruption between him and supply management officials at the South African Police Services. Van Loggerenberg told the commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, that Panday was accused of charging inflated prices for police accommodation as well as goods and services during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
