Acting Gauteng Premier, Panyaza Lesufi, is expected to visit patients wounded during the shooting incidents in Melville and Newtown in Johannesburg in the early hours of New Year’s Day. Two women were killed and six others wounded during a drive-by shooting outside a restaurant in Melville. Hours later, 11 people were wounded at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown. It is believed the shooter fired several shots from the upper level of the M2 double decker bridge onto the crowds. No arrests have been made. On Thursday night, Melville residents held a candlelight vigil outside the restaurant. “We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for this gesture. To the families who have lost their loved ones, we pass our sincere condolences to you. And we hope that during this time you will find peace in God,” says Kay Williams, Restaurant Spokesperson.
