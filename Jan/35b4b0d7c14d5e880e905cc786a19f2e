The South African Communist Party (SACP) says the United States must stop bullying the Middle East. Hundreds of SACP members picketed outside the US Embassy in Pretoria.  The SACP’s first deputy General-Secretary Solly Mapaila says American President Donald Trump is a threat to world peace. Mapaila led the SACP’s picket against the assassination of an Iranian General. “We condemn the collaborative actions of Israel that works together with America to destabilise the entirety of the Middle East; whether it’s Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, Iran and all those other countries that are currently under massive attack by the US. So we are here to stand in solidity with the people of the Middle East and particularly the people of Iran who are holding the fort against imperialism.” WATCH VIDEOS BELOW:
