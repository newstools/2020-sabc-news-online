Johannesburg police have denied reports that the death toll in the Mellville shooting has risen to three. Two people died at the scene of the shooting when gunmen opened fire on patrons outside a restaurant in a drive-by shooting, which occurred an hour after South Africa ushered in the New Year. Six other revellers were wounded. Two of them are critical in hospital. “Police have noted some media reports stating that a third victim of the shooting in Melville on New Year’s Day has died in hospital. We wish to dispel this claim as false and subsequently confirm that the number of fatalities still stands at two. Two victims are still in a critical condition in hospital while the other four victims remain in a stable condition,” says Gauteng Police Spokesperson Mathapelo Peters. In a separate incident, 11 people were wounded when an unknown person opened fire on those attending New Year’s celebrations at Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown. The incident took place at least two hours after the Melville tragedy. City of Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo and Acting Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi have condemned the incidents. “They are recovering. Fortunately, they were not seriously injured. However, we continue as a City to condemn such barbaric acts. It’s currently under investigation and the SAPS and JMPD are working around the clock to really get to the bottom of this issue. What we have gathered so far is that it did not happen from the Mary Fitzgerald Square itself. The shots seem to have come from the M1 from the highway instead,’ says Acting Mayoral Spokesperson Nkhensani Makhobela. Watch a related video below:
