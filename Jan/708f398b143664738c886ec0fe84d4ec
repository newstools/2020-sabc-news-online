African National Congress (ANC) KwaZulu-Natal Chairperson and Premier Sihle Zikalala has told party supporters, at a rally to celebrate the ANC’s 108th provincial anniversary, that it is important for the party to remember why it had embarked on the struggle. He says the ANC’s next enemies are unemployment, poverty and inequality. Zikalala was speaking at the Ugu Sports Stadium in Port Shepstone on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. “The apartheid state wanted black people to fight amongst ourselves and kill each other while they carry on ruling us. The divide and rule strategy made us fight amongst ourselves. That’s why we are saying it’s important as the ANC that we know why we fought. Our enemy was apartheid. Now our enemy is low job opportunities, poverty and inequality.” Watch the video for more on the story:
