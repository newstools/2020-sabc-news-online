Opposition parties in the Free State have blamed the governing African National Congress (ANC) for the worsening water crisis in the troubled Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality, which includes Qwaqwa. The dire situation in the municipality has prompted angry residents to take to the streets, demanding constant water supply.   Free State Economic Freedom Fighters Chairperson Mandisa Makeseni says the ANC is playing politics. “The money, when it is supposed to be channelled to the water project, it is being used for other issues. They are not using the money for the right reasons.” Free State Democratic Alliance legislator, Lehlohonolo Letuka shares the same sentiment. “At the moment it has escalated. The situation is really dire. I mean if we get to point now where even people can die trying to get water from a river and the poor child fell in there.”
