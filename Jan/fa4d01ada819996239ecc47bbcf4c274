The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture continues to hear testimony about the Gupta-linked TNA Media company. Former Eskom board chair Zola Tsotsi is expected to wrap up his testimony. On Thursday Tsotsi told the commission that the 2014 board regarded the TNA Media-Eskom deal as a bad contract as the power utility was struggling financially. That board then instructed the newly appointed board under Lynne Brown not to renew the TNA contract.
