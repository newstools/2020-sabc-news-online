Former Director-General in the Presidency Reverend Frank Chikane says anti-apartheid activist Dr Neil Aggett was struggling to walk the last time he saw him. Chikane was testifying at the inquest into Aggett’s death in the High Court in Johannesburg. He was also detained at the John Vorster Square Police Station at the same time as Aggett in January 1982. Chikane says it was clear to him that Aggett had seen the worst as he watched him being escorted back to his cell. He says he saw Aggett through a hole in his own cell. “I saw him coming with the police, struggling to walk. He was bending forward, almost like he was not able to pick his body and he was struggling to walk. He was slow, almost like a patient who was being assisted to get to his cell, and looked very distressed, and that was the last time I saw him.” Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the then John Vorster Square Police Station in Johannesburg on 5 February 1982. His family disputes the apartheid security branch’s claim that he committed suicide. Watch related video below:
