Movement for Democratic Change’s (MDC) Nelson Chamisa says he is in South Africa to request help in resolving the challenges facing Zimbabwe. Speaking on Morning Live, he says the critical issue is that of governance which is a political crisis born out of a disputed election in 2018. He says this has given birth to a legitimacy issue around the one who occupies the office of the president. Zimbabwe’s political stalemate between the ruling ZANU PF and its opposition, MDC has stifled the advancement of healthy democratic processes in the country. In December, former South African President Thabo Mbeki was in Zimbabwe at Mnangagwa’s invitation. Mbeki met the ZANU PF’s Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC’s Nelson Chamisa separately. Subsequent to the meetings, President Mnangagwa met with the leaders of opposition parties but the MDC was not part of the meeting. Watch interview below:   Chamisa says it has been almost two years since he last met with Mnangagwa. “This is quite said because parties should meet to find a way forward for the country. It sad that beyond the ballot we are unable to communicate.” “We thought that when Mr Mbeki came he would be able to facilitate a conversation between us and the president,” says Chamisa.
