Members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) have been picketing outside Eskom head offices at Megawatt Park in Sunninghill, Johannesburg. They are protesting against the planned unbundling of the Eskom business which will see the company divided into three entities – generation, transmission and distribution. The members of the two unions say splitting the Eskom business will result in major job losses. They also want to see an end to the independent power producers’ contracts which they say will further affect Eskom’s finances. The restructuring of Eskom was first announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his State-of-the-Nation-Address in February last year. He indicated that the three subsidiaries would be owned by Eskom Holdings.
