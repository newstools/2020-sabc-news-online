The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) says the deployment of the SANDF to Kimberley, Northern Cape, during the African National Congressâ€™s (ANC) 108th anniversary celebrations is unconstitutional. The FF Plus says in terms of Section 201 of the Constitution only the President may grant permission for soldiers to be deployed alongside the police. It says the fact that the soldiers were reportedly withdrawn immediately after their presence became public knowledge means that an illegal command was probably issued to deploy the soldiers. The accountable persons are going to have to explain why this happened, said the party. The FF Plus says it will pose questions in Parliament to determine who issued the command and will also inquire whether any steps were taken against the relevant persons who issued the seemingly illegal command.
