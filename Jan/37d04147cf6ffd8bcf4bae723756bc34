The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed Water and Sanitation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu’s decision to officially declare the drought-stricken Northern Cape a disaster area. The DA has been putting pressure on the government for some time now to address the crisis that has devastated the agricultural sector in the province. Sisulu made the announcement in Kimberley on Friday after meeting with officials from the province. She says she had no choice but to make the declaration once all legal processes have been finalised. Sisulu says declaring the province a disaster area will give the drought urgent state attention. DA MP in the Northern Cape, Willie Aucamp, says the decision to direct R200 million in funding to address the crisis is a step in the right direction but more is required to bring widespread relief to the province. Aucamp also reiterated the DA’s call on Northern Cape Premier, Zamani Saul, to invoke Section 25 of the Public Finance Management Act to make available additional emergency funds to provide immediate drought relief to farmers.
