The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape has sent its condolences to the family of council ANC chief whip, Bicks Ndoni, who died on Monday. He collapsed during a meeting in the African National Congress (ANC) regional offices at Florence Matomela House in Port Elizabeth. Ndoni served as deputy mayor to former mayors Nceba Faku, Nondumiso Maphazi and Danny Jordaan until his election as chief whip of the council two years ago. “He is one of those politicians who was loved by everyone, his way of doing things and his interaction with other political parties. We were all shocked here. For now we all say condolences to his family, friends, his political party which is the ANC and I’m sure for the residents of Nelson Mandela Bay it’s a huge loss,” says Tshonono Buyeye, Nelson Mandela Bay Interim Mayor.
