Acting General Secretary of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA) Cassim Lekhoathi, says they are calling on the department of health to urgently address the issue of security at public hospitals and clinics. DENOSA is concerned about the number of attacks and what it calls ‘poor’ safety at public health facilities. It has suggested non-negotiable security measures to the government following several incidents where intruders gained entry to hospitals and clinics. Just last week, a 47-year-old patient was shot dead at Clairwood Hospital in Durban. Speaking on Morning Live, Lekhoathi says they have basic demands which the government should adhere to. He says: “We are calling for the installation of boom gates, CCTV cameras and panic buttons.” “We believe if these were available at public health institutions, perpetrators of crimes would have been traced by now. Sadly, it seems security is not a priority for the government.” “We believe it is the duty of the employer to provide a safe working environment for the employees and the patients. Government hides behind the words we want to provide essential services at our institutions and yet they fail to provide essential security,” says Lekhoathi. Watch full interview below:
