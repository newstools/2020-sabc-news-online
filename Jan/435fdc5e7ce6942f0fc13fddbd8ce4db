Traffic volumes across the Eastern Cape are expected to increase as holidaymakers make the return journey home. Spokesperson for the Eastern Cape Provincial Traffic Authority, Charles Bramwell says they expect the volume to increase from about midnight. “We are expecting increase in volumes on our main routes out of the Eastern Cape. It’s the R61 from Umtata to Queenstown, Cradock Graaff-Reinet, and Aberdeen into the Western Cape. The N6 from East London to Aliwal North into the Free State province is also busy. The N2 both sides: East side to KwaZulu-Natal and the western side towards Tsitsikamma.” Bramwell also urges caution on wet roads as rains are sweeping over some areas. “Currently the province is also experiencing rainy conditions and we are urging motorists to be extra careful and adjust their speed limit accordingly.
