The children were on their way home from school. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Pelonomi Makau says an adult male threatened the three teenage girls with a knife before raping one of them. Makau says police are looking for the suspect. “The man threatened them with a knife and instructed them to accompany him to an open field near the graveyard, which is between Vryburg and Huhudi Township. He instructed them to undress.” “He allegedly forcefully and grabbed a 13-year-old and raped her and ran away thereafter. It is alleged that the other two were made to watch the incident. No arrest made as yet and an investigation continues,” explains Makau.
