Eskom says it is working towards limiting the risk of load shedding despite the power system remaining constrained. The power utility says there is no load shedding expected for Tuesday and that technicians are working to restore generation units that were on planned maintenance, as well as those experiencing breakdowns. Eskom says power has also been restored to parts of Mpumalanga after heavy rain caused disruptions to coal supply overnight. Earlier Eskom Spokesperson Dikatso Mothae refuted reports that Stage-8 load shedding was imminent. Mothae said, “We see a stage 8 situation as a low risk incident. We are working around the clock and our technicians are doing what they can in terms of making sure that we limit the risk of load shedding.” “We are not expecting any (load shedding) today. The system remains quite constrained so the risks are still there, but as it stands no load shedding expected today,” added Mothae.
