Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and former US Vice President, Al Gore, have re-affirmed their support for the global divestment in fossil fuels and investment in renewable energy. In a joint statement made in Cape Town, Tutu and Gore, say that corporations, governments and institutions that continue to invest in fossil fuels, despite all the evidence of their effect on accelerating climate change are furthering environmental, economic and social injustice. Both leaders say, although fossil fuels drove northern hemisphere industrialisation and development, it was the poorer southern hemisphere nations that could least afford to mitigate the impact of climate change and would bear the highest cost.
