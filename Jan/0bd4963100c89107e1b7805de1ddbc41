Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande says the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has approved more than 430 000 applications for the 2020 academic year. He says those that have not secured a space will in the meantime be referred to the Central Applications Clearing House for assistance. Nzimande was briefing the media in Pretoria on his department’s readiness for the current academic year. “Now, in the 2020 applications, NSFAS has received a record-breaking number of applications by end of November 2019. More than 500 000 first time ever applications of which the year before it was about 400 929, which means the applications are up by 26%. These were received by applicants from across the country.”
