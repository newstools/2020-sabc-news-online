Fledgling party, the African Transformation Movement (ATM), is already gearing up to contest 2021 local government elections. Party leader, Vuyo Zungula, was in Mndeni, Soweto on Saturday to mobilise the party’s Johannesburg regional structure and residents of the area to support the ATM’s vision. The party, which was formed in June 2018, joined Parliament for the first time last year after winning two seats in the National Assembly. It holds a single seat each in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislatures. Zungula says he is confident that his party will gain a concrete foothold in Gauteng in the next election. “We have a very strong support base hence we are contesting all the regions come 2021, we have various organisations and we have members.” “This is only a certain part of Joburg that is meeting today in the course of the coming months we will be going to East Rand, Pretoria and all of the other regions in Gauteng.” Click video below:
