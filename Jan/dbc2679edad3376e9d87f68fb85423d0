Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Deputy President Floyd Shivambu is expected back in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning. He is facing assault charges following an alleged altercation with a reporter on the grounds of Parliament. Shivambu is said to have accosted the journalist for taking a picture of him arriving at Parliament and objected to his picture being taken. He made his first appearance in December 2019. The case was postponed to Tuesday to allow that the defence obtain documents, including video and still pictures that form part of the state’s evidence. It is alleged among others, Shivambu grabbed photographer Adrian De Kock by the throat on the parliamentary precinct after the journalist asked him for comment and took a picture of him. Shivambu is one of several EFF leaders facing assault charges following attacks on various individuals. These include party leader Julius Malema, Secretary General Marshall Dlamini and spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Shivambu is also awaiting censure of Parliament’s ethics committee related to the alleged attack on De Kock.
