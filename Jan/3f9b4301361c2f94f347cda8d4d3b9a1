At least 30 people have been killed and many more injured in a bomb blast in northeastern Nigerian, local sources told Reuters late on Monday (January 6). An improvised explosive device detonated on a crowded bridge at around 5pm local time in the market town of Gamboru, in restive Borno state. The bridge, which leads into neighboring Cameroon, is a popular crossing and trading point. No group has taken immediate responsibility for the attack. But both Boko Haram and the regional offshoot of Islamic State are active in the area.
