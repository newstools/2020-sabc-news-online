The Western Cape needs 88 train sets to run efficiently, but currently only 33 are operating. This has been revealed at a media briefing – the first in Cape Town since the appointment of Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo last month. Mpondo and Metrorail Regional Manager, Richard Walker told the media plans are in place to bring stability to the network over the next 12 months. Walker says new trains will be allocated to the province. “The plan is still to bring those eight sets down, operate on the Cape Flats corridor this year and what it also then does is allow us to free up those trains for other corridors and that will definitely increase the capacity, by October 2020 the plan is then to have 20 of those new train sets operating in the Western Cape.”
