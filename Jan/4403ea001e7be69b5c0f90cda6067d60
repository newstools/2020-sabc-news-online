The provincial department was only notified late Friday about Seboko’s death and learnt late on Thursday about Mpianzi’s disappearance. Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says thorough investigations must be conducted into both incidents. “We are extremely shocked and saddened by these because we didn’t expect that we would start off in this way. I mean the families of those learners are grieving at the moment and we convey our condolences to them. it’s quite shocking that learners would still be drowning and when you listen to what is being said about the circumstances around it, it does indicate that some more investigation needs to be conducted to understand why a learner would drown. There were other people? There are rules. There has to be someone to take care of them, there has to be measures put in place to make sure that everyone is alive, all activities that they are undertaking are safe.”
