After a record low in November 2019, the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) has risen to 4% in December 2019. Statistics South Africa on Wednesday released the Consumer Price Index which highlighted that the price inflation was 4,0% in December 2019, up from 3,6% in November 2019. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/804937">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> The inflation rate rise was largely due to an increase in food and non-alcoholic beverages. The increase of 3,9% year-on-year on these beverages contributed 0,7% point to the total CPI annual rate.

The 4,0% index for December 2019 shows a slight increase when compared to the same period at the beginning of the decade when CPI was sitting at 3,5%.

The South African Reserve Bank cited weak economic growth as the reason why inflation remained under control. (SARB) painted a grim picture on the outlook for economic growth, lowering its predictions for this year and next to 1.2% and 1.6% respectively. The forecast for inflation was now seen at 4.7% in 2020 and 4.6% in 2021, compared to the previous forecast of 5.1% and 4.7% respectively. Inflation, as measured by the annual change in CPI, is the key measure used by the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee to set interest rates.
