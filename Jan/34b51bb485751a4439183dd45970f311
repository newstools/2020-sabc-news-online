African Transformation Movement (ATM) leader Vuyo Zungula has slammed National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise’s decision to approve a motion to institute proceedings to investigate Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane‘s fitness to hold office. On Friday, Modise announced that the legislature had adopted new rules concerning the Public Protector’s removal following the DA’s request to begin such a process. The party claims that Mkhwebane is unfit to hold office, citing damning court judgments against her. Speaking at the ATM’s Johannesburg Regional Assembly in Mndeni Soweto, Zungula said that there was a witch-hunt against Mkhwebane because of her investigations into the rich and powerful. He says his party will not support any decisions that will undermine South Africa’s constitutional democracy. “What we are seeing now is a case of having untouchables where you cannot go against the likes of President Ramaphosa and Pravin Gordhan.”
