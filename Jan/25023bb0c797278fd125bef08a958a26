The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in Parliament says it will do everything possible to ensure that Section 25 of the Constitution is not amended to allow for land expropriation without compensation. Briefing the media in Cape Town on its parliamentary programme for 2020, the party’s caucus says it will reject the position of the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) that the Constitution be changed to allow for land to be taken without any compensation being paid. “We can’t be half pregnant, as I say because the EFF is coming with a solid position and the ANC is also coming with a solid position, and we need a solid position as well which we will enforce into these discussions. This is a matter that must be treated with the highest level of sensitivity and also the highest level of responsibility because of the economy, for social cohesion, for stability and to make sure that there is no abuse of the process,” says IFP Member of Parliament and the party’s spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa.
