Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) President Julius Malema has pleaded with residents of Glaudina, in the now-dissolved Mamusa Local Municipality in the North West. to give his party a chance to govern. Malema was addressing a community meeting organised by the EFF, as part of the party’s campaign.  By-elections will be held in all nine wards in Mamusa on Wednesday. The provincial government dissolved the municipality last year citing financial mismanagement and the collapse of service delivery. Malema says they will change the status quo. “Give us a chance now, because if we mess up, you can take us out next year August. So, we are here to plead with you, please, the self-love of black people starts today, in ward 1, by rejecting a party that rejected us for more than 25 years.”
