Two South African teachers working in China have been told to prolong their holidays due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Nelani and Zama Majozi are back in the country and were scheduled to leave next week but their employers in Jiashan County have instructed them to postpone their return. At least 40 cases have been reported in their county which is eight hours from the epicentre of the outbreak in Hunan province. The cousins say they’re concerned about their health and job security. “Everything is shutdown; malls are shutdown, cities are closed, people can’t even leave their hotels. We need to postpone our flights so we don’t end up paying more but at the same time I don’t know if it’s wise to postpone it and the virus is pretty bad. I’m not sure if I want to go back; I’m still deciding if I want to go back. It’s not an easy decision to make, especially if it means I’m going to be unemployed for months.” WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
