The National Transport Movement (NTM) says although it has received assurance from the Business Rescue Practitioner at South African Airways (SAA) that the airline will soon receive the much-needed R2 billion cash injection – the threat of retrenchments still looms. The airline was placed under voluntary business rescue last month, and there are concerns that government may not be able to provide the funding to get the airline back on its feet. The NTM’s Mashudu Raphetha says they’ve been given the assurance that the money will arrive by the end of this week. He however says it’s clear that retrenchments remain inevitable. “We are going to make sure that we salvage every job that can be affected. But something that is inevitable is job losses. We have told the business rescue practitioners (BRPs) that they need to look at releasing people, those that are close to retirement.” “The volunteer severance packages and those who want to leave so that they can have a thinner SAA and then we will take it from there. SAA is going to survive but it’s going to be in a different shape. It cannot be as big as it was,” explains Raphetha.
