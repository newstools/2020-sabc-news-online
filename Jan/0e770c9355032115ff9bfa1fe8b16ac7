Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi says the department has received almost 13 000 late applications for online registration for grades 1 and 8. The late online registration process was opened on Wednesday and will close on the 24th of January. He says all of those who registered late have been placed. Lesufi says he has also finalised all appeals from parents. He says, “All the people that have applied, all of them, have been placed. The reason why it is easy to place them is because they applied where they had availability. But our district offices are still updating people that have been rejected, and they are waiting for their appeal outcomes. We understand their frustration, the appeals are huge, so we have to go through a process of verifying everything that is alleged in that appeal.” Lesufi has also added that, “All the appeals have been finalised and released.”
