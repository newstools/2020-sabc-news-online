North West Health MEC, Madoda Sambatha, says he will appoint an independent team to probe allegations of nepotism at the Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital Complex. This follows a list of more than 20 people allegedly appointed through nepotism, which is making rounds on social media platforms. Sambatha says the team will be set up this week. “My investigation is to determine as to whether indeed people have used nepotism and friendship to recruit staff in the hospital. I am also contemplating taking away the recruitment powers especially for Matlosana sub-district,” says Sambatha. Sambatha says based on the outcomes of preliminary investigations, the department will immediately suspend those found to be implicated. “Any one irrespective of the position and irrespective the seniority, heads will roll. Gone are those days when people are allowed to extend their influence by appointing family members. The issue of family members, a family relative to anyone who is employed, there is no law that says they cannot be employed but that must be done through a competitive process,” says Sambatha.
