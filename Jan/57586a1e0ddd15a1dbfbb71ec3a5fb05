The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will continue to hear testimony on Friday about the Gupta-linked TNA Media Company. Former Eskom board chair Zola Tsotsi will wrap up his testimony on Friday morning. On Thursday he shed light on how former Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown had been captured by the Gupta brothers. Tsotsi also told the commission that the 2014 board regarded the TNA Media-Eskom deal as a bad contract as the power utility was struggling financially. That board then instructed the newly appointed board, under Lynne Brown, not to renew the TNA contract. However, Tsotsi says he was under the impression that the TNA contract was a renewal and continued to facilitate business with them. Internal Communications Specialists for Transnet Group, Joseph Jackson is expected to testify. The Commission will also hear testimony from former Senior: Stakeholder Relations for Transnet and from a formerÂ  Transnet Board Chairperson. Former Eskom board member, Mafika Mkhwanazi will also testify. WATCH RELATED BELOW:
