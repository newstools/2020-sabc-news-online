South African Airways has cancelled 28 local and 10 international flights. The affected routes are return flights between Johannesburg to Cape Town as well as Johannesburg to Durban between the 20th and the 24th of January. The cash-strapped SOE was placed under business rescue in December, requiring R4 billion to kick start the process, led by practitioner Les Matuson. The national carrier says these cancellations represent a responsible strategy to conserve cash. It says it will re-accommodate passengers on its services between Johannesburg and Frankfurt. Locally, SAA says it is working with its sister airline Mango to re-accommodate passengers to minimise disruption. The company says this is in line with its policy of reviewing flights and consolidating services with low demand.
