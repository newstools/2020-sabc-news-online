Eskom says no load shedding is expected on Monday. The power utility says they have managed to conserve diesel at their open cycle gas turbine generators. Eskom implemented stage two load shedding over the weekend. The decision was as a result of a conveyor belt failure at Medupi power station which has since been repaired. The power cuts come as South Africa continues to try find solutions to its energy crisis. In December, President Cyril Ramaphosa had to cut short his official visit to Egypt after rolling power cuts and stage six load shedding was implemented, forcing mines to stop their underground operations. President Ramaphosa said there would likely be no load shedding between 17 December and January 13 as leave for those responsible for keeping the lights on was cancelled.
