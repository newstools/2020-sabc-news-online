Vendors along the Durban beachfront say they have not made enough money this festive season, despite millions of domestic and international tourists who flocked to Durban beaches. Hawkers say business did not go very well. Some have blamed it on the country’s poor economy. “During this time in 2018, we had made a lot of money through selling. But this time around the business is not going well. Holidaymakers say they don’t have money.” “We did not make enough money this festive season. It’s bad,” says one vendor. “We did not make money at all. What makes it even hard is the weather.” “As street vendors, there are just too many of us now who are selling because the economy is down,” some street vendors say.
