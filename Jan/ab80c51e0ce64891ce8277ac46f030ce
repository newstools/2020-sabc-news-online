A three-day shutdown by residents of QwaQwa in the Free State has been suspended temporarily. QwaQwa and Kestell ground to a halt on Monday as residents demanded immediate water supply. QwaQwa and surrounding towns such as Harrismith and Kestell have been experiencing water shortages for more than a decade.  Workers and learners could not go to work and school during the protests as all the roads were barricaded with stones and rubble. A task team involving all the stakeholders has been set up to finalise the agreement on resolving the water crisis in the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality. The decision was taken following a lengthy meeting between a government delegation which includes Deputy Minister of Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Parks Tau, and deputy Minister of Water and Sanitation David Mahlobo, church leaders and leaders of the shutdown.
