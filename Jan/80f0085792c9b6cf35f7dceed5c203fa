The Interim Provincial Committee in North West has convened an African National Congress (ANC) provincial Lekgotla, to be held in Rustenburg. It will be attended by all party structures, alliance partners, NEC deployees in the province, and representatives from government, and state owned enterprises. The North West’s ailing municipalities and a possible provincial cabinet reshuffle are some of the issues that will be discussed over the next two days. The gathering comes at a time when municipalities in the province are reportedly failing to effectively deliver efficient services to residents. Fifteen of the province’s local authorities have been placed under administration in the past two years. Reasons range, from poor services delivery, maladministration and financial mismanagement, amongst others. The Lekgotla comes in the wake of allegations that there might be a reshuffle in the provincial cabinet. Whilst the members meet to look at challenges facing both the party and government, it is uncertain whether or not deployees will execute resolutions of the Lekgotla, considering the on-going factional battles within the party.
