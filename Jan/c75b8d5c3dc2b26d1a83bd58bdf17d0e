People came in numbers to pay their last respects to Yvonne Mantwa Khoza, from the business sector, football fraternity, as well as politicians. Khoza’s death moved a number of people from near and afar and some were left startled. Basotho Royalty Prince Seeiso Bereng Seeis says, ”During this difficult time the word of the Lord says on his cross there is true freedom, put your trust in God together with your family because he is the one that will carry you through the darkest valley.” Neighbour Phindinhlanhla Xaba says, “A powerful woman in our society. You cannot mention Ausi Mantwa without mentioning Dube community, where she did so much. She was an entrepreneur and a philanthropist.” Khoza was an inspiration to many. Motsepe Foundation’s Dr Precious Motsepe says, “We both grew up in Soweto and always talked fondly of our roots. What I really liked about Mantwa was her sense of style. I enjoyed watching how she dressed and how she walked.” The football fraternity is mourning the loss a mother-figure, as Orlando Pirates legends were overcome with nostalgia. Marks Maponyane says, “When you see Mantwa at the airport, you would know that the game was important. She was a mother of the team, but not interfering. She would know everything that was happening in the team. And when I bumped into her at the stadium, she would say, ‘Ngwana ko gae, why you don’t teach these guys? You see, they are costing the team.’ She was just herself.” And then, a moving eulogy by her husband Dr Irvin Khoza. “Her signature was quality, cleanliness, truth, punctuality and thankfulness. She accompanied these qualities with loyalty. Loyalty came naturally to her. Thank you for your kind words and acts of love.” Hundreds of people from all walks of life witnessed the sending off of Mantwa Khoza. Watch the videos below for more on the story:
