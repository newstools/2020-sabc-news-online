Leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) Prophet Shepherd Bushiri has thanked church members and his followers for their continued support, amid strings of allegations against him and failed efforts to close down his church. On New Year’s Eve, the pastor filled up the FNB stadium in a crossover service that drew thousands of people from around the continent. He vowed to  continue serving the people. “We experienced several challenges in 2019, but you stood with us. Some counted our downfall, but you stood firm with our ministry and on this fourth Crossover Service you have filled up FNB stadium. This is a testimony of your resolve.” Bushiri faces money-laundering charges. He and other church leaders are also accused of sexual misconduct, claims he has rejected. Natinal civic organisatin, SANCO, tried getting his church shut down after three congregants died in a stampede during a thunderstorm at Bushiri’s church in 2018. The CRL Rights Commission however cleared the church, saying it had fully complied with safety regulations. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
