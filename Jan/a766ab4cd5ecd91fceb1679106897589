Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile says he is concerned about the chaos that took place at the City of Tshwaneâ€˜s special council meeting. The meeting descended into chaos after the council did not agree on the order of the agenda. This comes amid repeated attempts by the Economic Freedom Fighters and African National Congress to oust the Democratic Alliance administration in Tshwane. Maile says the behaviour of councillors showed total disregard for the interests of Tshwane residents. Related video below:
