John-Paul Emmanuel fled Nigeria seven years ago to escape the clutches of Boko Haram and he thought he had found a safe place to operate his shop and raise his family in Kimberley in the Northern Cape. However, all that changed when a crowd of locals turned up at his shop last week demanding he leaves. He had to flee again and is still staying in a local hotel with his family. “We are one Africa. I believe that South Africa is one of the countries that has law and they believe in it. If a person  commits any crime then that person must face the law. They can’t just attack people because of their nationalities,” says John-Paul Emmanuel. The price is much higher for others and many are losing income. “We are not working again and you know tomorrow schools are opening, and I am a father of two boys and tomorrow they are going to school. I don’t know if they are going to be safe,” says Congolese Migrant, Jacques Nzabanita. Meanwhile, leaders of the protests have vowed to continue with their actions and spread it to other towns.
