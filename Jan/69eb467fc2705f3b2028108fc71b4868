Chaos has yet again erupted in the Tshwane Special Council meeting currently taking place in the Capital City Tshwane on Thursday. The meeting was petitioned by opposition parties ANC and EFF. The opposition wants to table motions of no confidence to oust the DA Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and Speaker Katlego Mathebe. The Speaker and opposition, however, are disagreeing on the agenda and order of the meeting. Opposition parties want the motion of no confidence against the Speaker herself to be the first item on to be dealt with by council. However, the Speaker doesn’t want the motion against her to be the first item. Opposition parties are now calling on Cogta to intervene. They’ve accused the Speaker of trying to protect the DA from being ousted. ANC and EFF combined have the majority in the Tshwane council.  The ANC and EFF wrote a letter to Mathebe’s office on Wednesday, saying she did not consult with them about the proposed agenda and suggested a new agenda. The letter stated that Mathebe, the acting Speaker and Chair cannot preside over the council as they are conflicted. It further suggested that the acting City Manager presides over the meeting to elect an acting Speaker from the Councillors to preside over the motions of no confidence.
