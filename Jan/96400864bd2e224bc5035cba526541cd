The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, will on Thursday hear testimony from the Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya. He is expected to outline the interference of the executive in the work of the Hawks in recent years and the challenges it continues to face. Lebeya was appointed to head the crime-fighting unit in 2018. The appointment of Godfrey Lebeya to replace disgraced Hawks Head Berning Ntlemeza offered hope in many circles that the integrity of the body could be restored. In recent years, the Hawks have been caught up in political battles and scandals which have resulted in criticism that they are unwilling to investigate the rich and powerful. The loss of senior personnel among others, former boss Anwa Dramat and the unitâ€™s Gauteng head Shadrack Sibiya, has been attributed to the manipulation that the body has been subjected to.
