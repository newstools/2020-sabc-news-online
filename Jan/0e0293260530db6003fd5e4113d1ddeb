Johannesburg waste management entity (Pikitup) says it is battling to collect waste across the city due to shortage of trucks. Pikitup says it needs 155 waste collection trucks to be able to run a full service. It currently has an aged fleet of 117 trucks, some of which are prone to breakdowns. Joburg MMC for Environment and Infrastructure services Mpho Moerane says from April 1st, the city will sign a new contract with a service provider for the supply of a fleet of truck to help collect waste. He says the previous DA-led administration is also to blame.
