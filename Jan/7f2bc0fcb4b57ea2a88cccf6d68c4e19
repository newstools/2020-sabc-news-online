The National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has approved a request to initiate procedures for the removal of the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The Democratic Alliance made the request. The party believes that following several adverse court judgments against Mkhwebane, she is not fit to hold office. The approval comes after Members of Parliament’s Sub Rules Committee in September agreed that a panel must be appointed by the Speaker to investigate whether prima facie evidence exists, for a head of a Chapter Nine Institution to be removed. This, as the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, instructed the Rules Committee to start a process of drawing up draft rules for the removal of the head of a Chapter Nine Institution. The Sub Rules Committee has resolved that the process to remove the Head of a Chapter Nine institution,  must go through four stages. The first is an initiation process, followed by a preliminary assessment for prima facie evidence. Then an inquiry by a committee and a final decision must be taken by the National Assembly.
