The Africans Union (AU) says it will hold a new round of Libya peace talks later this month. The AU hopes to gather Libya’s factions in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo on 25th January. A meeting between the United Nations (UN) backed Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army in Moscow has failed to confirm a peace deal, with the LNA asking for more time. A plan by the African Union to hold a peace meeting for Libya in 2019 failed. At this 25th January summit it hopes to convince the UN backed Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army to put an end to their fighting. The United Nations says at least 280 civilians and about 2 000 fighters have been killed as the LNA has sought to take the Libyan capital Tripoli in the past nine months. AU chairperson Moussa Faki Mahammat has asked the parties to create safe corridors for the provision of humanitarian assistance whenever it is needed in their country. A summit in Germany’s capital, Berlin, on Sunday is also expected to discuss developments in Libya. Both the AU and the UN have warned against external interference in the Libya Crisis. South Africa, which will take over the AU chairmanship this year, has pledged to help Libya find an African-centred solution.
