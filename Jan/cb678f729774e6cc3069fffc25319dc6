Flights were suspended until further notice at the only functioning airport in Libya’s capital Tripoli on Friday due to rockets falling nearby, an airport official said. The closure of Mitiga Airport comes a day after Turkey’s parliament voted to allow a troop deployment to Libya, deepening fears of an escalation of fighting in the North African country. Eastern-based forces led by military commander Khalifa Haftar have been waging a campaign since April to take control of Tripoli from forces aligned with Libya’s internationally recognized government. The offensive soon stalled in the outskirts of the city, but has led to increased international involvement in the conflict. Mitiga Airport has been repeatedly closed and reopened in recent years because of risks from shelling and air strikes.
