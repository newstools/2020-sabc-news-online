The leadership of the Catholic Church in Southern Africa (CCSA) has presented its pastoral plan to President Cyril Ramaphosa at his official residence in Pretoria. The plan will guide the work of the church in South Africa, Botswana and eSwatini and is aimed at ensuring that the church remains actively involved in the society on socio economic issues. It outlines how the church will be proactive on issues such as moral regeneration, healing and reconciliation, building healthy families and marriages as well as promoting non-violence in society. The plan will be officially launched in the historical Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Soweto on Sunday morning. Secretary-General of the Southern African Catholic Bishop’s Conference Father Paul Rakeketsi says, “We come from the past that we know about, our society is divided along racial lines. Today we have issues of nationals and foreign nationals, there has to be healing and reconciliation. We want to promote non-violence.” “You can see the violence that we are experiencing today in families, gender-based violence, people don’t care and the church is going to work around these as well,” added Rakeketsi.
