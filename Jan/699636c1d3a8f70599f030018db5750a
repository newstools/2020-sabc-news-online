Trade union Solidarity has asked for a moratorium on retrenchments at Telkom. The telecoms giant has notified unions that up to 3 000 workers could lose their jobs as it struggles with declining performance in fixed voice and data services. Telkom SA says the job cuts will affect its wholesale division Openserve, consumer unit as well as its corporate centre. In a letter to unions, Telkom says the planned job cuts will be managed in phases, with phase one starting immediately until April. Solidarity Strategic Specialist Morné Malan says, “There are times when retrenchments are necessary- that is when the sustainability of the company is being threatened. On the other hand, we believe that these particular retrenchments which are unwarranted, threaten the very sustainability which they promise to protect. Our moratorium is basically our way of saying wait before we go onto retrenchments, let’s see if we can’t have a more beneficial agreement which can be beneficial to both parties, something where the employees as well as the employer can agree upon.” Click below for more:
