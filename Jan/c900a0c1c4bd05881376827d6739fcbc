South Africans will have to endure a dark Sunday following Eskom’s decision to continue with load shedding. The power utility implemented state 2 load shedding on Saturday night due to a conveyor belt failure at Medupi power station. This was meant to continue until 8 o’clock on Sunday morning. However, the power utility issued a statement a little over an hour before the end of the power cuts – saying the outages will continue until 5 o’clock Monday morning. The national electricity supplier says this will enable it to replenish its diesel and water reserves. They were depleted due to the conveyor belt failure and a loss of additional generation units. Eskom has said its teams are working around the clock to minimise the risk of load shedding as South Africans return to work from Monday. Watch below video for more:
