Anti-apartheid activist Prema Naidoo has testified about how he feared he would be killed by security branch police on the 10th floor of the then John Vorster Square Police Station during his interrogation in 1981. He was detained at the station from November 1981 at the same time as his fellow activist and union organiser Dr Neil Aggett. Naidoo has been testifying at the inquest into Aggett’s death, held in the High Court in Johannesburg. Aggett was found hanging in his cell on 5 February 1982. Naidoo says security branch police officers often referred to the 10th floor of John Vorster Square as the Timol Heights. This in reference to how they had killed another activist Ahmed Timol. Naidoo says they threatened him by saying it would soon be known as the Prema Heights, suggesting he’d also be killed the same way as Timol. He explains how he was ordered to strip naked as they continued to interrogate him, while punching, kicking and slapping him as different officers walked in and out. The hearing continues.
