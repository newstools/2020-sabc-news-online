The principal of Parktown Boys’ High School has been suspended with immediate effect. This after investigations revealed that the school went on an unauthorized Grade 8 camp at the Nyati Lodge in the North West province. This is where 13 year old Enock Mpianzi died during a water activity last week. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi made the announcement at a media briefing in Johannesburg. Last week Lesufi appointed an independent law firm to investigate what led to Mpianzi’s death. Lesufi says preliminary investigations have revealed many inconsistencies that have forced the department to take action. “We have enquired the role of all persons in line of authority and have responsibility to care for and support our learners in schools; in this regard we have concluded that the principal of the school is the delegated authority with the responsibility for the safety of our learners in schools. And thus we have taken the decision to immediately suspend the principal.” Lesufi also revealed that the school did not comply with the department’s policy, which requires schools to apply for authorisation from the district three months before the proposed trip. The school only applied in November for the January trip. Lesufi also announced that some district officials would also be suspended. “All the officials at the district who handled the application for the trip must be served with letters of suspension as investigations are carried out. The leadership of the school is represented here by the school governing body, we believe the school governing body will not escape our scrutiny; we will be guided by parents of the school later this evening on the kind of action we should take or not take.” – Additional reporting by Angela Bolowana.
