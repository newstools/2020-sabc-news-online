Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning and CoGTA Lebogang Maile, has reversed with immediate effect the suspension of both the DA’s Speaker of the City of Johannesburg, Councillor Vasco Da Gama and current Speaker of the City of Tshwane Katlego Mathebe. Maile suspended them without pay for three and six months respectively for allegedly breaching the code of conduct of councillors. In a statement, Maile says after consultation with senior counsel about the legal action the DA took regarding the suspensions, he rescinded his decision. Maile says he will not deal with the merits or demerits of rescinding their suspensions on Monday but will address a media briefing on Tuesday in Johannesburg. On Monday,  the Democratic Alliance (DA) confirmed it has submitted an urgent application to the High Court to suspend Maile’s decision to suspend Mathebe, and Da Gama. DA Gauteng chairperson, Mike Moriarty, said Maile’s decision had placed risks to the effectiveness of service delivery in the two cities.
