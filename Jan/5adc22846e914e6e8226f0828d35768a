So, the MEC for Education in Gauteng is going to the school just to understand what might have transpired. We don’t have more details but we are rushing to the school just to be briefed on what has transpired and what is the latest and we have already unleashed our psycho social unit so we can provide necessary counselling.” Watch video below for more:
