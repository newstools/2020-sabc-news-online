The EFF has called on government to establish a state-owned bank that will prioritise investment in young African entrepreneurs, in honour of the late Richard Maponya. In a statement, the party hailed Maponya as the African business legend and icon. The party praised Maponya for establishing the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NAFCOC) in 1964, to look out for African business interest during the apartheid era. Maponya passed away this morning following a short illness at the age of 99. Meanwhile, Congress of the People (COPE) says the passing of Dr Richard Maponya is a loss to the business sector. COPE says Maponya was a selfless businessman. COPE spokesperson, Dennis Bloem says he fought against unemployment and created hundreds of jobs in the country. “We have lost a giant in the business field, not only in the business field but a giant in the liberation struggle of our country to free the oppressed. He was a man who has worked up until his last day on earth.”
