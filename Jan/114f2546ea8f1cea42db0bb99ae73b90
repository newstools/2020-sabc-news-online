Dam levels in the drought-stressed Karoo have risen to 22%  following unexpected rains in the Gouritz-River catchment area last week. Spokesperson for the Western Cape Local Government Ministry, James-Brent Styan, says the rainfall is however not enough to break the persistent drought. He says dam levels across the province have shown an average increase of up to 3% with dams supplying Cape Town standing at 71%. Styan has urged consumers to continue to use water sparingly. As large parts of the country battled the rain in early January, large parts of the Eastern Cape coastal belt and adjacent interior have had little impact on the level of Nelson Mandela Bay’s main supply dams. According to figures released by the municipality, the average combined capacity of the metro’s main supply dams was at 29.43%. Residents are urged to remain vigilant and report water wastage. Updates and predictions from the South African Weather Services paint a bleak picture and consumers are urged to comply with the stringent water restrictions in place.
