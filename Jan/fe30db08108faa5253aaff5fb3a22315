South African Airways (SAA) says it’s doing everything possible to avoid further deterioration of its financial position. The airline has cancelled at least 30 domestic flights between Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban and 10 return flights to the city of Munich in Germany. The airline says it cannot rule out further flight cancellations. SAA which was placed under voluntary business rescue is battling to stay afloat ahead of the arrival of a R2 billion cash injection from government. However, National Treasury says it’s trying to find the money. The airline’s Chief Commercial Manager Philip Saunders says: “When we consolidate flights, it’s one of the many measures that are being discussed and authorised by the business rescue practitioners to conserve cash and make sure that we are in a strong position when we have that restructured viable airline.” “Everybody is working incredibly hard, the business rescue practitioners, the government and the management and board of SAA – to make sure that we have that sustainable future and we create a bridge to the moment that additional funding that we do require is received by the airline.” Related Video Below   Meanwhile the National Transport Movement president Mashudu Raphetha says they are optimistic that the problems at SAA will soon be resolved.

We are looking at government to ensure that the 10 000 direct employees at SAA, not only them but even 45 000 of those who are in the borders of the republic. Related video below
