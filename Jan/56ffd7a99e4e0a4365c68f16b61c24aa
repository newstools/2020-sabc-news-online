Two juveniles accused of setting 18 train carriages alight in November last year are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday. The pair, aged 14 and 15, were caught after one of them was recognised in an identikit. The identikit was released by Metrorail following the incident at Cape Town station. The passenger rail agency, PRASA, earlier offered a R100 000 reward for information that would lead to a successful conviction. The rail system in the Western Cape has been crippled by ongoing arson attacks and theft of infrastructure.
