Members of the National Metal workers Union (Numsa) will picket at the Eskom Head office in Megawatt Park in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The purpose of the picket is to raise their concerns on the unbundling of Eskom and the privatisation of state owned entities. The picket will take place at lunch time between 12:00 and 13:00. Numsa spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubu-Majola says: “We are already seeing the privatisation taking place at Eskom through the renewable energy and independent power producers.” “Our members will be picketing in protest against these changes which are going to impact all of us. The unbundling and the privatisation of Eskom will result in us even paying more for energy that we pay at the moment. It will result in massive job shedding. ”
