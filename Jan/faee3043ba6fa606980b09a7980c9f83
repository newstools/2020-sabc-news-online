The Congress of the People (COPE) has described as unacceptable the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) threat to disrupt the State of the Nation Address next month if President Cyril Ramaphosa does not fire Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. EFF leader Julius Malema made the threat at the weekend. COPE national spokesperson Dennis Bloem says Parliament is a platform to exchange ideas and not physical confrontation. “No, we are saying that Parliament is not a forum for boxing. It’s not a boxing ring. It’s a forum for debate. The threats by the EFF that they will disrupt the State of the Nation Address if Pravin Gordhan is not fired by the President is completely uncalled for and totally unacceptable and we are condemning that type of threat and it can’t be allowed.”
