The KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative and Traditional Affairs Department has dispatched a disaster management team to the Inkosi Langalibalele Local Municipality in Estcourt, in the province’s midlands, following a hailstorm. Four people were injured and more than 100 houses damaged in last night’s hailstorm. MEC Sipho Hlomuka says they are yet to assess the extent of the damage. “There was a strong wind at Langalibalele at Ward 5 and it destroyed houses. We activated our provincial disaster management team working with the district disaster team as well as local disaster team to assess the situation. We are assisting our people and also appeal to business people and other state holders to come forward and assist,” says Hlomuka.
