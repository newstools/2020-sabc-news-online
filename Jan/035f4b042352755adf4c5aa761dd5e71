The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) will request a meeting with eNCA management to discuss allegations of censorship at the television news broadcaster. Former eNCA political reporter Samkelo Maseko made the allegations. In a drawn-out war on social media, Maseko alleged head of news Kanthan Pillay,  who has since been fired, had censored stories. Sanef’s Hopewell Radebe says censorship in the industry should always be strongly condemned. “To make sure that we knew what had happened on the side of the management, we also sent a letter asking for clarity on our part so that we get to know the side of the story from the side of the management; what has happened. That letter was delivered. It is our belief that because it was already December and people were closing, maybe even management of eNCA were not available. So, we are expecting the response sometime in the week or this year at least now in January,” says Radebe.
