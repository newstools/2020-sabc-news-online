Residents of Muyexe near the Kruger National Park in Limpopo say they are living in fear of wild animals roaming in the area. A hippo was shot and killed by a ranger in the village on Tuesday. Muyexe traditional leader, chief Sambula Maluleke, is calling on Environmental Affairs Department and the Kruger National Park to ensure that the park’s fence is reinforced. “I’m very worried because that thing is very dangerous now when they come here we panic a lot because that thing is very dangerous you run away from that thing but there were rumours that there’s the other one so that one we didn’t get it government and the Kruger National Park they have to do something or maybe they make a joint venture to fix up the whole fence where these animals are coming out.”
