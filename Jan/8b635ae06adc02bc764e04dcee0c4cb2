The cash-strapped Butterworth-based Mnquma Municipality in the Mnquma Municipality has given residents a discount of 50% in unpaid municipal rates. Residents, businesses and tenants of municipal-owned owe the municipality over R160 million in unpaid rates including historical debt. Municipal Manager Silumko Mahlasela says the discounted rates run until the end of February. Mahlasela says, “For instance, if one owes R10 000, it means his debt is R5 000 we will negotiate how he or she is going to pay the remaining R 5000 because we want to make sure that basic services to our people like street lights, electricity and all other necessary basic needs are being done. “Another important thing is that some of the people who owe the municipality might be indigent but we will not know if they are not coming to the municipality,” added Mahlasela.
