Police have arrested eight suspects and confiscated several unlicensed firearms during various anti-gang operations in Cape Town. Police spokesperson, FC van Wyk, says they arrested four suspects for the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Two pocket knives were found in Bellville while a suspect was also nabbed in Lavender Hill for the possession of a revolver and ammunition. He says they also arrested a 19-year-old man who had a firearm, with the serial number removed and ammunition in Mitchells Plain. Van Wyk says an 18-year-old was later arrested with 15 rounds of illegal ammunition in Manenberg. The suspects are due to appear in court soon.
