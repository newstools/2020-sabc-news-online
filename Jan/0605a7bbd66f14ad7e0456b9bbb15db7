The South African Cabin Crew Association says it cannot be business as usual while South African Airways has a countless number of problems. SAA’s Business Rescue Practitioner, Les Matuson, met with Public Enterprises, Trade and Industry and Treasury officials to discuss the crisis at the airline. Despite not yet being able to contribute R2-billion as part of its commitment to the business rescue process of SAA, the Department of Public Enterprises says it is working with National Treasury to raise funds to keep the airline afloat. The department issued a statement on Sunday evening in which it reassured the public of its commitment to the business rescue process. SACCA President, Zazi Sibanyoni-Mugambi, says government should urgently take drastic measures to save the ailing airline. “Government need to really after they committed to providing a R4-million to fund the business rescue. We cannot have a wishy washy airline. We cannot have the brand going further down because if we do this, less passengers are willing to fly SAA and this is dangerous. We’ve seen a press statement this morning saying they committed to fund but we need them to commit fully to this process,” says Sibanyoni-Mugambi. Watch a related video below:
