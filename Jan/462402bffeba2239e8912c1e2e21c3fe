The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for a forensic audit into Eskom amid continued load shedding. The party says it also wants answers from the Ramaphosa administration regarding the return of stage two load shedding which appears set to continue on Monday. The party cites reports that Eskom wants to issue almost R2 billion in performance bonuses, to the ‘bloated’ staff compliment and plans for tariff hikes on consumers as among the issues of major concern. Meanwhile, COPE National Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says the current unexpected load shedding is a test of new Eskom CEO Andre De Ruyter’s knowledge and capability as he officially starts work. Bloem says, “We don’t know what his capability, his capacity is, but it’s very clear. His work is cut out. They have said he was going to start on the 25th of December. Now we are seeing that there is already load shedding. So we don’t know what he is going to do at Eskom. We hope that he is also not coming with a lot of baggage, he is coming to fix this load shedding. We only hope, we don’t have a guarantee of his capability and his knowledge about Eskom.” WATCH
