Police are investigating a case of malicious damage to property and arson following the burning of Langalibalele primary school in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. Provincial police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says a group of angry parents went to the school this week demanding that the department of education build them a new one. Hlathi says police believe the same group of people who came to the school on the 16th January could be the same group that proceeded to set the school alight on the 17th. He says: “There are some parents who does not regard the education of their children as important, whatever the government is doing to assist is shot down.” “We are saying let us gather relevant information that may assist the police to arrest those who are responsible for the torching of the building.”
