Former security branch police officer, Joseph Nyampule has told the High Court in Johannesburg that the last time he saw anti-apartheid activist, Neil Aggett was when he was recording complaints from political detainees. He says Aggett complained to him that he was requested to write one statement after the other that would be torn up by the security police. Nyampule says not long after that incident, Aggett was found hanging in his cell on February 5, 1982. He was giving testimony at Aggett’s death inquest through an interpreter. “I last saw Aggett when I was taking complaints. He told me that he doesn’t know  what to do anymore because he was requested to write a statement, but they will tear it off. He would write another the same would happen, they would  tear it off again,” explains Nyampule.
