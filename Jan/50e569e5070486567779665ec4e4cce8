ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has blamed state capture for some of Eskom’s problems. He was speaking to the SABC after delivering the ANC’s January 8 statement in Kimberley earlier on Saturday. Ramaphosa was responding to questions about the state of the struggling power utility following the resignation of Eskom chair Jabu Mabuza over the latest electricity crisis in the country. “As Medupi and Kusile were being built there was cost overrun, they went way beyond what they should have cost and obviously state capture was part of the mix and so the problems were so multiple that lead to where we are and now today we are having to deal with the problem of power stations that are old,” says Ramaphosa.  The ANC President, however, sidestepped questions posed to him by SABC News’ Mzwandile Mbeje (MM) over the future of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan following calls from unions and the EFF that he be sacked. “Jabu Mabuza himself even as they made the promise they did not highlight the risk because there was a risk. MM: But in terms of those who are responsible politically are you going to do anything? ANC President: We are focussing on repositioning Eskom right now. MM: With the same people? ANC President: We’re going ahead you know the people who are executing various tasks they need to focus on those tasks and we move on.”
