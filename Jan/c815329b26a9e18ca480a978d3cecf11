The situation remains volatile in the protest-hit Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality in QwaQwa in the Free State. Angry residents have been protesting over constant water supply since Monday. The tragic death of seven-year-old girl, Mosa Mbele, who drowned while fetching water from a river, has added to the growing public anger. Residents of Kestell, 20km from QwaQwa, have also joined the protests. Maluti-A-Phofung was placed under administration in February 2018 due collapse in governance and maladministration. Despite the two day protest that engulfed many villages, many of the residents can be seen walking around freely in the streets with few cars in the streets. Many businesses remain closed to avoid being broken into. The shutdown action has now moved to Kesteel where residents on Tuesday night blockaded R57 road. Kestell is also battling with water shortages.
