KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has revealed that two of the suspects who allegedly shot a teacher at a primary school in Inanda, are former learners of the school. The other four robbers have also been identified through CCTV footage. This information has been handed over to the police. A group of six people arrived at the Buhlebethu Primary School in Inanda, north of Durban on Wednesday. They met with the principal under the pretext of wanting to enrol a learner at the school. Mshengu says the group went into the staff room, on their way out and started to rob teachers. “The principal witnessed that incident through the cameras and the screams of teachers. She then pressed the panic button and called for help through the intercom, as it were. So, as they were leaving the staff room, then they encountered this other teacher who was probably coming to assist his colleagues who were screaming for help. Unfortunately, he was shot on the chest and then these six people ran away. Meanwhile, Mshengu says teaching at the school has been suspended until Monday to provide psychological assistance to traumatised learners. “The psychologist will be back again on Monday to see those that could not come today as we have seen that the attendance is very low today. Most of the learners could not come to school probably because they are shocked. So, we still need to counsel those who are coming to school on Monday – who are shocked after witnessing such a terrible incident.” Click video below for more:
