The African National Congress (ANC )  Tshwane regional chairperson, Kgosi Maepa, has dismissed the Democratic Alliances ( DA)  laying of criminal charges as an attempt to shift focus from service delivery issues in the city.   The DA Deputy Chief Whip in the City, Mpho Mehlape-Zimu, has laid criminal charges against the Chief Whip of the ANC, Aaron Maluleka, and his party’s Caucus leadership. This follows allegations of forging of councillors signatures in an attempt to convene what Mehlape Zimu says was an illegal council sitting. The DA and the ANC in Tshwane have been at each other’s throats since November 2019 after executive mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, took special leave and Member of the Mayoral Committee for Transport Sheila Senkubuge resigned.
