Two learners have been killed and two others critically injured after a food delivery truck crashed into a wall at the Lekgolo Primary School in Mamaila outside Elim in Limpopo. Community members are on the scene consoling relatives of the children. The four learners are all from the same family. It is believed that they were standing on the side of the wall when the trailer of the truck that had just delivered the schoolâ€™s feeding scheme food hit the wall and it caved in on them. One of the deceased was in Grade R while the other was in Grade five. A group of confused community members is standing outside the school gate, while some inconsolable relatives of the deceased are in a closed meeting with education officials. Police are still at the scene. Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo is expected to visit the school later today.
