Former Lily Mine workers in Mpumalanga are continuing with their efforts to recover the remains of their colleagues, who were trapped underground when the mine caved in about four years ago. Pretty Mabuza, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyarenda were inside a container that was used as a lamp room. One of the former workers, Harry Mazibuko, says they believe that they are now closer to the container. Mazibuko says they are working together with the illegal minors to achieve their mission. “So what we found today while digging is a fence and a pole of the fence which we believe was the fence that was fencing the power station next to the container. So the spirit and the mood here at the camp it is very high.” The former workers and the family members of the three victims have been camping outside the mine for almost nine months now.
