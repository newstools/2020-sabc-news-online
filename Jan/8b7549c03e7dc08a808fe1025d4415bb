A high-powered government delegation has been deployed to the strife-torn Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in the eastern Free State. Angry residents have embarked on violent service delivery protests demanding constant water supply in QwaQwa, Harrismith and Kestell. Users on Twitter have since posted videos of the chaos that erupted at the start of the protests on Monday.  Cooperative Governance Deputy Minister Parks Tau and Deputy Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation David Mahlobo are expected to meet with community leaders on Wednesday morning in a bid to quell simmering tensions. Maluti-A-Phofung was placed under administration in February 2018 due to governance collapse and maladministration. Free State Cooperative Governance MEC Thembeni Nxangisa says they are determined to find a lasting solution. However, community leader Scotch Sikhosana says they will not stop until their demands are met. “The people are angry. They want water, simple water. Water is not a privilege, but a Constitutional right. So, we are not going to suspend that,” says Sikhosana. The area remains volatile and police are monitoring the situation.
