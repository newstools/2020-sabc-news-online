Former Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane, is officially making his way back into politics.  Maimane resigned as the leader of the main opposition party in October last year. He will be launching his new party called the ‘Movement’ in the next two months. “When I left the DA it wasn’t just the question of the DA, it was a question of the institutional body of politics. I left there believing that South Africans are feeling distant from the political principles and I said to myself for the targeted view – I want to engage society and business. I want to engage other political and different sectors of society. A movement that is non-racial, a movement that is focused on the future a movement that gives South Africans their power back.” Click related video below:
