African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on all faith-based organisations to continue to pray for the party. He told church leaders who were gathered at the Galeshewe community Centre, outside Kimberley in the Northern Cape that there will never be a moment where the ANC will be de-linked from the church.  Ramaphosa, who is in the province for the ANC’s 108th anniversary celebrations, says if it was not for the religious organisations, the ANC would not have existed. “We will never be able to de-link the connection that exists between the ANC and the faith-based organisations. Even if you were to like doing it, it will never happen. The church was not only the midwife, but it was what I characterise as a shareholder of the African National Congress. ” Ramaphosa says the ANC will always be open criticism from the church. “Continue keeping the African National Congress on the path that you determined right at the beginning. We’ve got experience of 108 years, as an organisation, we do grow, some will falter and some disappear.” Click below for more on ANC’s 108 birthday celebrations:
