Lesotho’s governing ABC party has asked Prime Minister Tom Thabane to resign over allegations that he was involved in the murder of his estranged wife two years ago. The party describes him as a “threat to the nation.” Lesotho’s police commissioner made the allegations in court documents. Dipoolelo Thabane was murdered two years ago on the outskirts of the capital Maseru two days before her husband’s inauguration. The Prime Minister hasn’t responded to the allegations. He suspended the police commissioner in what the ABC deputy leader describes as an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. The latest is that Thabane’s second wife is also a suspect. Thabane, who is now 80 years old, and Dipoolelo had allegedly been embroiled in bitter divorce proceedings.
