South African Airways (SAA) has defended its decision to cancel some of its local and international flights. In a statement issued on Tuesday morning, the struggling national carrier says the move is aimed at conserving cash and optimising the airlineâ€™s position ahead of further capital injection. Among flights affected are those linking Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban and Munich in Germany. According to the statement, the flights will remain suspended until the 24 of January.  SAA says it will continue to review flights schedule over the coming days. It says changes will be communicated with its travel partners and customers at the earliest opportunity. The cash strapped airline is still awaiting a R2 billion capital injection to avoid liquidation. Government has promised that it will pay the money to ensure the survival of the airline.
