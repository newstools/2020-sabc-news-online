Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Zingiswa Losi says if the African National Congress (ANC) wants to continue being in an alliance with the labour federation, it must be biased towards the poor of the country. Losi says the ANC must always make sure that it sticks to all its promises and delivers basic services and jobs, especially to the poorest of the poor. Losi made these comments while delivering a message of support to the ANC at the party’s 108th anniversary in Kimberley, Northern Cape. She says, “The African National Congress is biased towards the poor and the working class. But we want to see it, we want to feel it.” “So, Cosatu says we will remain in alliance with the African National Congress, however we want an ANC that listens to its constituents,” added Losi.
