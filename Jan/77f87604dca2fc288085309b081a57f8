The family of the late anti-apartheid activist, Neil Aggett, is looking for answers as the inquest into his death while in police custody, gets underway in the South Gauteng High Court on Monday. Doctor Aggett was found hanging in his prison cell on 5 February 1982. He had been detained without trial and interrogated at the notorious John Vorster Square police station for 70 days. Human Rights Lawyer, Moray Hathorn is representing the family free of charge. He was speaking to SABC News. “This is a truth-finding exercise. I think fundamentally the family wants to find out what is the truth presenter: what really happened that night they’ve never believed that Neil committed suicide. We might get a finding of murder for instance it’s a possibility. But whether we’ll get a prosecution for murder is a different thing, because in this case unlike in the Timol case, we don’t have a member of the security branch who placed himself in the same room.”
