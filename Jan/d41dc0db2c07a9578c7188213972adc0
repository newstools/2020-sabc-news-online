The Speaker of the City of Mhlathuze in KwaZulu-Natal, Slondile Mkhize, has opened a case of hate speech against a Richards Bay businessman Lorenzo Greyling. Greyling allegedly posted a comment on his Facebook page about the litter on the beach after the city’s annual beach festival in which he allegedly likened Black people to baboons and monkeys. Mkhize says people like Greyling should learn that they cannot insult other people and get away with it. “So we need this speech to be investigated and we need this thing to be attended to and we need the whole of South Africa to know that there are still some people who hate Blacks. Because most of the people who were attending the beach are Blacks and definitely what was said by Mr Greyling was directed to Blacks.”
