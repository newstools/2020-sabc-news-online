Gauteng Human Settlement MEC, Lebogang Maile, has sent out his condolences to the family of Mogale City Mayor Patrick Naga Lipudi. He died on Sunday morning after a short illness. “On behalf of the Gauteng provincial government, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the Lipudi family. His colleagues and his organisation the ANC. Councillor Lipudi succumbed to his death earlier this morning after a short illness at the age of 59,” says Maile.   Lipudi has been Mogale City Mayor on the Gauteng West Rand since 2017, after the African National Congress (ANC) regained control of the municipality from the Democratic Alliance (DA) with allegations that the DA councillors had betrayed their party in a motion of no confidence.  Funeral arrangements have not been finalised as yet.
