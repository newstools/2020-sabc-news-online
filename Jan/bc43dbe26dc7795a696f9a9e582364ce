Foreign nationals living in Cape Town’s Central Methodist Church say four children have died from chickenpox since last month. They want to be sent from South Africa to another country other than that of their country of origin, claiming that they are no longer safe in this country. They’ve been staying in a church at Greenmarket Square since October. Internal conflict has broken out, dividing the foreign nationals into two groups. Some have accused a prominent leader of abuse of power and instigating violence. Papy Sukami, the leader of one of the groups, says they are appealing to the City Of Cape Town and UNHCR to provide them with temporary accommodation. “Four children last month, we have three or four children suffering from chickenpox right now in the church. We are homeless, we don’t have anywhere to go. If they can provide any temporary accommodation where people can be safe in the meanwhile while we are waiting for the UN to come for the individual interview for the resettlement.” SAHR to meet with refugees The SA Human Rights Commission says a meeting will be held on Monday next week to find a solution to the crisis faced by foreign nationals in the Cape Town City Centre. Human Rights Commissioner Chris Nissen says there’s an urgent need to find a solution to the crisis faced by the foreign nationals before the matter is back in court on the 22nd of January. He says the leaders of the foreign nations, the City of Cape Town, the Home Affairs department and the office of the UNHCR will meet on Monday to discuss alternative accommodation. “People are desperate they say we thought we are going to be resettled, but it’s not gonna happen, two weeks the schools are starting, we need to get those children to school, we will engage the leadership on these issues with all those stakeholders to ensure that there’s protection for women and children the most vulnerable.”
