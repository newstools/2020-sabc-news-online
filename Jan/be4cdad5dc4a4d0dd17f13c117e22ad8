The Iranian presidency says the country’s President Hassan Rouhani and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa have spoken telephonically and in their conversation, Rouhani has urged friendly states to take a stand against the US. Tensions have peaked in the Middle East after a US drone strike in which top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.  Washington had accused Soleimani of numerous attacks on US interests in which many American troops have been killed. The statement on the Iranian presidency’s website labels the US strike on Soleimani “illegal”. It says Rouhani told President Ramaphosa that he hoped South Africa would continue to stand alongside Iran and condemn what the statement describes as America’s “state terrorism”.
