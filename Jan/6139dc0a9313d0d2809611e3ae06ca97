The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) hopes that establishment of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex (LGBTQI+) desk by the party will assist in the fight to end gender based violence (GBV). The desk was launched by the ANC during its January 8 birthday celebrations in Kimberley, earlier this month. The desk forms part of the ANC Women’s League and its membership will encompass all LGBTQI+ groups. Kimberley based transgender woman Patsy Alley says crimes against LGBTIQ+ people can now also be prioritised. Alley says, “It’s the violence issue, the violence against transwomen, against lesbians – the corrective rape.  Our assertion also as women because our issues are not just limited to LGBTQI+ people, our issues are issues that some women generally in a relationship are facing.  It is the justice for women,  it’s the access to the economic opportunities.”
