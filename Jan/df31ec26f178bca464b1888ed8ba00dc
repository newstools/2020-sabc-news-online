Eskom says it’s working hard to restore power to several towns in the Mohokare municipality in the southern Free State after technical problems. A transformer fault resulted in the power outage which started on Sunday night. Free State Eskom spokesperson, Stefanie Jansen van Rensburg, says they are investigating the cause of the power interruption. “The failure of a transformer at Rouxwille substation yesterday evening at around 7 o’clock resulted in loss of supply in Zastron, Smithfield and Rouxwille including rural customers. The supply to Zastron town has been restored but the rural people in the area are still without electricity supply. Smithfield and Rouxwille should be by later this evening or in the early hours of tomorrow morning. At this stage, the cause is still unknown but as the investigations continue, we will determine the cause.”
