The South African Communist Party (SACP) says the African National Congress (ANC) has not backtracked on its position of land reform. This follows a newspaper report that the ANC is now proposing that the minister and not the courts must have unlimited powers on the expropriation of land without compensation. WATCH BELOW:  SACP first deputy general-secretary Solly Mapaila says their understanding is that the first intervention in appropriate pricing should be the executive, and if the land owner objects to the price then the court process can kick in. He was delivering the Joe Slovo memorial lecture on the Cape Flats on Sunday. “It should not first go to court because otherwise the executive will become a spectator in the process of land reform. Let the executive make a determination, if such a determination is objected to, it can then go to court. Because if you start a court process [and] once the court has decided, the executive will have no role,” adds Mapaila. WATCH RELATED VIDEO BELOW:
