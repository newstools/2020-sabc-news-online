Children from the community of Eerste Fabriek, Mamelodi, who were affected by the December flash floods, will not be returning to school on Wednesday as they lost everything. The community of Eerste Fabriek squatter camp had their belongings swept away and have been staying at the Mamelodi Baptist Church. A mother Rene Ntshudisang says they are struggling. Ntshudisang says, “I don’t feel well because my kids do not have any shoes, any school clothes. They only have the stationery and the stationery is not complete because we don’t have the money for the cover and the pencil, and the ruler and the ballpoint pen.”  Meanwhile, Mamelodi Baptist Church Pastor Tembelani Jentile says engagements are continuing with various stakeholders in a bid to resolve the situation. “They have agreed to bring the services the Home Affairs and Social Development people which they said may be here next week. So we are looking forward to that. They also wanted the list of children who may be in need of some stuff. So we will hear what they say. We really want to appeal to the government to really assist these children. These children don’t have shoes. They don’t have school uniforms. Some of them don’t even have food to eat at school. Hopefully, there will be some food at school to eat. But for sure we will assist them when they get to church.”
