Campaigning is in full swing in the Schweizer Reneke based Mamusa Local Municipality in North West. The African National Congress and Economic Freedom Fighters are to hold their rallies on Sunday afternoon in the Ipelegeng township, to garner support for Wednesday’s by-elections. Eight political parties and an independent candidate will be contesting the elections in 9 wards. The ANC-run municipality was dissolved by the provincial government last year due to the collapse of service delivery and financial mismanagement. ANC NEC members including Fikile Mbalula, Obed Bapela, and Malusi Gigaba are among speakers that will be addressing the mass. The rally is part of the party’s campaign to win votes in the upcoming by-elections expected to be held on the 14th and 15th January.
