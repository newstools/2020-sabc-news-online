A new breakaway party has been formed by disgruntled members of the National Freedom Party (NFP). The NFP’s only councillor- Philani Mavundla and some party members are behind the formation of the Abantu Batho Congress (ABC). In December, two factions in the NFP locked horns when they planned parallel conferences due to internal squabbles But one of the factions cancelled their meeting and did not attend the main conference in Ulundi. Mavundla says the new breakaway party will contest next year’s municipal elections. “How this came about is the fact that you have quite a lot of people who are not sure or clear as to what is the direction with major political parties. But in the NFP, it has come out very clearly that if you believe in democracy you don’t have space.” “As it stands at the moment there would be people who are part of the ABC who are still members of the NFP. We don’t want to jeopardize their positions. There are very prominent business people who are part of this, there are very key politicians who are from other political parties who are part of this,” Mavundla further explains. The NFP’s squabbles date back to 2016, when the party failed to contest municipal elections. Some party conferences were shelved and others challenged in court due to infighting.
