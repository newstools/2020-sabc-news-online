The African National Congress (ANC)  has described as laudable Eskom board chairperson Jabu Mabuza’s apology for his failure to keep a promise he made that there would be no load shedding before January the 13th this year. On Friday night, party president Cyril Ramaphosa said he had accepted Mabuza’s resignation and thanked him for his short stint at the helm of the cash-strapped power utility. Earlier, ANC deputy president David Mabuza stunned the nation when he said the Eskom board chairperson and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan had misled the President on load shedding. ANC national spokesperson Dakota  Legoete says, “As the African National Congress, we note the resignation of Mr. Mabuza. We hope that will assist Eskom in getting it into a better position because it has become very clear that other related deployments, particularly in SOEs, need skills. So, the resignation of Mr. Mabuza, we need to commend him because it shows honesty from his side.” Watch related video for more on the story:
