Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says his department will be instituting its own investigation into the death of the Parktown Boys High learner. Lesufi says according to information received, the boy went missing on Wednesday and his department was only informed of the disappearance late last night. The learner, from Parktown Boys High School was participating in an Orientation Camp. “That’s the part that we still have to investigate because our mandate was just for us to get the body or to get the child. The police said there are things that they have observed and they will want to interrogate some of the learners there and also to speak some of the educators. So, we also appointed an independent person to investigate on our behalf.” Meanwhile, a parent of a Grade 8 learner at Parktown Boys High School says he wants answers from both the school and Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi after the death of the learner while on a camp. Katlego Mphela says his son was also on the Orientation Camp where the fellow learner, Enock Mpianzi perished. The school has come under pressure to explain the circumstances around the 13 year old’s death. Mphela says he only heard about Mpianzi’s disappearance and death through the news.
