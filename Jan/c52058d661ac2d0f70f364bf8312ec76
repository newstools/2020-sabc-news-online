Khoisan communities are calling on government to speedily implement the Khoisan Traditional Leadership Bill. President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Act late in 2019, giving recognition to what many regard as South Africa’s first people. In the last decade, the number of Khoisan Kings and chiefs have grown with many claiming sovereignty over an area or people. The Khoisan Traditional Leadership Act has built a mechanism to determine legitimacy of these claims. While the Commission is yet to be established, communities are worried about its composition. “We are a bit worried as to how the commission will deal with the Khoisan issues. The Khoisan issues are not like the Nguni tribes.” Others say, “We hope and ask for the Presidency and the Department of Traditional Affairs to speed up the process because we’re standing now for 500 years outside waiting to be recognised.” Watch the video below for more on the story:
