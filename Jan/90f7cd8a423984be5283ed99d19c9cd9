The fate of suspended Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa is likely to be sealed at this weekend’s meeting of the Democratic Alliance’s Federal Executive Council (FEDEX). In the first meeting of the party’s leadership in 2020, the FEDEX will discuss the investigation conducted by its Federal Legal Commission into Mokgalapa who is currently on special leave. The party is also expected to start preparations towards its all important policy and elective conferences scheduled for April and May respectively. Party spokesperson Solly Malatsi says: “What will dominate the discussion will obviously be preparatory work for the policy conference. That must be completed by April and secondly to kick-off the process to make sure that we will have that early elective congress which the review committee resolved upon, and a decision was taken at the last Federal Executive Council meeting that we should  have the Elective Congress by May.” “So as of today, we are rolling out communication to structures of the party about submission of membership books in order to make sure that by the time we get to Congress, all branches are ready and have held their meetings,” he added.
