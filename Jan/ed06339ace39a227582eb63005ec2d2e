The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) has expressed anger at the constant load shedding. The trade union says the power utility every December and January plunges the country’s economy into crisis. It says load shedding costs the country billions of Rand. Numsa has called on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to take drastic measures that will help Eskom avoid the constant power cuts. It says the power utility does not have the necessary human capital for maintenance of the current fleet of power stations. The labour union has cautioned that load shedding will result in the loss of jobs and destroy livelihoods of many people. Numsa believes the constraint in the country’s power gird is due to high and increasing reactive, instead of proactive, maintenance. Eskom implemented Stage 2 load shedding from 1am-6am on Wednesday. The power cuts were reintroduced over the weekend after a national respite over the Christmas holidays.
