Disgruntled residents of Diepsloot north of Johannesburg have gone on a rampage looting spaza shops in the township.   Protesters have also blockaded several roads in the area including William Nicol Drive. Police have attempted to calm the situation. However, the number of protestors continues to increase. They have also fired rubber bullets at demonstrators in an attempt to disperse them.   The protest follows the killing of a police officer last week. 54-year-old Detective Oupa Matjie was fatally wounded on Friday while tracing suspects wanted in a case of attempted murder and house robbery. Itâ€™s understood that two undocumented foreign nationals have been arrested in connection with his murder. Residents say they want undocumented foreign nationals to leave the township, blaming them for the high crime rate in the area. The community has called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to urgently meet with them to discuss a solution to reduce crime.
