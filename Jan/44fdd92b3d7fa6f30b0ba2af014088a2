Opposition parties in the City of Tshwane have served the Speaker with papers demanding that she call an urgent council sitting or they will be forced to head to court. This follows yet another failed attempt to petition the Speaker for an urgent council sitting. The African National Congress  (ANC) petitioned for the urgent sitting to table motions of no confidence against Speaker Katlego Mathebe and Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. The parties were hopeful that the sitting in the Democratic Alliance (DA) run council would take place on Thursday afternoon, but that failed as a result of Mathebe not issuing a notice of an urgent sitting. A similar situation also unfolded on Wednesday night. “As the ANC, what we have done, we have sent our lawyers to send a lawyer to the speaker; we want a reply today (Thursday)  by 4pm to tell us what is happening, why are we not having a meeting. If she fails to do so, the EFF has sent the same letter from their lawyers, if she doesn’t want a meeting, we are heading to court,” says ANC Chairperson in Tshwane Kgosi Maepa. WATCH BELOW:
