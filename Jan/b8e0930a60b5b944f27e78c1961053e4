Several events are organised on Wednesday to mark the ANC’s 108th anniversary in Kimberley. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa is addressing members ahead of the main party’s commemoration. All NEC members are in the province on various community engagements as part of the program. This is part of the ANC’s celebrations of the January 8 Statement this Saturday.  Earlier Ramaphosa laid the wreath at Sol Plaatjie’s grave and says his land aspirations must be realised. He hailed Plaatjie as a selfless leader and urged the current crop of ANC leaders to emulate him. He says Plaatje’s aspirations about black people and land is a historic project that they have to be fulfilled.
