The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema has threatened that his party will interrupt the State of the Nation address on February 13 if President Cyril Ramaphosa does not fire Public Enterprise Minister, Pravin Gordhan for misleading government over the situation at Eskom. Malema addressed a rally in North West on Sunday ahead of Wednesday’s bi-elections in Schweizer-Reneke, North West. Eskom board Chairperson, Jabu Mabuza resigned on Friday after admitting that he had failed to keep a promise that there will be no load shedding before January 13. Malema says if the President does not act on Gordhan, it will be a clear indication that Ramaphosa is failing to protect the assets of South Africa. He says, “I want to tell Cyril Ramaphosa today that if he can’t fire Pravin before the State of the Nation address, the State of the Nation Address shall be about Pravin. We will stand up there. We will stop him from speaking. We will tell him you must fire Pravin because we must protect South Africa’s assets. If Ramaphosa is not prepared to protect our assets by firing Pravin, then Ramaphosa must go.” Click below to watch related video:
