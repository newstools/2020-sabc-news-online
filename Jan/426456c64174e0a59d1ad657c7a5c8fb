The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is imperative that an extension is granted for the lifespan of the Zondo Commission into State Capture. Chairperson of the commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has announced that the South Gauteng High Court has been approached to extend the commissionâ€™s work until the end of the year. DA MP on Justice, Glynnis Breytenbach says the DA supports the move. She says even though it means that taxpayers fork out more money, a longer lifespan could mean that billions of rands lost due to corrupt activities would be recovered. She expressed hope that as the commission extends its investigations, more people are likely to be prosecuted.
