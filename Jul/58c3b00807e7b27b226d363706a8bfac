Eskom will continue with Stage 2 load shedding from Monday morning at 9 o’clock.  The power utility says there will be no load shedding during the rush hour in the morning. Eskom Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says despite efforts to return additional generation units to service after last week’s breakdowns, they have not made sufficient progress to suspend load shedding. “In order to limit the impact of load shedding on the morning traffic peak, Eskom will start implementing Stage 2 load shedding from 09:00 tomorrow (on Monday). This will continue until 22:00. Implementing load shedding tomorrow (Monday) is also necessary in order to replenish the emergency generation reserves to better prepare for the week.” Eskom announces Stage 2 load shedding on Monday: #POWERALERT 1 Stage 2 loadshedding to continue until 22:00, then resume at 09:00 tomorrow pic.twitter.com/5TrhOWo7bP — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) July 12, 2020  In the video below, Eskom says Stage 2 load shedding will continue:
