The first drive-through COVID-19 testing centre in Tshwane opened this week at the SuperSport Stadium in Centurion. The private health care centre allows people to be tested for the coronavirus while sitting in their cars. The drive-through testing centre offers people a chance to test without having to make an appointment or the need to be in a waiting room. Kennedy Gihana who made use of the opportunity says, “It is convenient, you just drive through, whether you come from home or coming from work. It is easy to pass by and then after 10 minutes you are done.” The centre is run by Kholofelo Chauke, together with her two colleagues. Chauke says, “When they come in they go to the first station, that’s where we do the screening, like if they have been in contact, referred to have symptoms, because else you won’t be tested. Yea, we don’t just test anybody you need to qualify to do the test.” A test costs R1190 and the results are sent to the person within 3 to 5 working days. And are also forwarded to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). Chauke says they email an invoice to the patient, who can then claim the money back from their medical aid.
