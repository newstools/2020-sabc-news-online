The SA Jewish Board of Deputies says former Cosatu leader in the Western Cape, Tony Ehrenreich has at last apologised for inciting violence and hatred against the leadership of the Jewish community. In August 2014, in a social media post,  Ehrenreich called the Jewish leadership “complicit in the murder of the people in Gaza” and also called for “an eye for an eye”  retribution against Zionist supporters. National Chairman, Shaun Zagnoev, has commended the SA Human Rights Commission for upholding a complaint of hate speech and ordering Ehrenreich to apologise. He says the long-awaited outcome of this case sends a clear message that it is never justified to threaten one’s fellow citizens for representing views that one disagrees with.
