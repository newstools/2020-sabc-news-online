The Nelson Mandela Museum in Mthatha has come up with several virtual programs to honour former president Nelson Mandela’s legacy. The museum, which is usually a hive of activity during this period, will be closed to due COVID-19 regulations. Two exhibitions namely “Freedom” and ‘The Mandela Quilt ‘ will be virtually launched as part of honouring his legacy, and these will be used as travelling exhibitions. The museum has kickstarted its Mandela Day program in true Madiba style, by giving food to the less fortunate around the city. In the video below, a look at activities the museum has planned:  This as the world celebrates International Nelson Mandela Day. The day marks the struggle icon’s birthday, but it’s now the day where everyone is asked to do good for humanity in remembrance of his selfless service.
