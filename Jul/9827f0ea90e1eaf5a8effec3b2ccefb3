The application will be heard on July 15. We’ve just received confirmation from the Gauteng Division of the High Court in Pretoria that our application for leave to appeal the ruling of 26 June 2020 dismissing our #CigaretteBan challenge will be heard on the 15th of July 2020. — Sinenhlanhla Mnguni (@SinenMnguni) July 9, 2020  In June, the court dismissed with costs, the association’s application to have the ban overturned.

FITA’s bid is one of two to have the ban on the sale of cigarettes lifted. The British American Tobacco South Africa’s (BATSA) case will be heard on 5 August. In the video below, Yusuf Abramjee speaks on ban on sale of tobacco products:  Founder of Tax Justice SA, Yusuf Abramjee, has previously called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in the matter and overturn the ban. “Every day that the ban continues, the crooks are becoming more firmly entrenched and enriched. During the three months or so of the lockdown, decent South Africans have lost more than R3 billion in excise duties alone that money is desperately needed to fight the crisis crippling our country,” says Abramjee.
