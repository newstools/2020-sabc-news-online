Lancet Laboratories has advised people not to come to test for coronavirus without a doctor’s referral at their premises. The private laboratory says they are experiencing a backlog at their testing sites. Professor Eftyxia Vardas, Clinical Virologist from Lancet, says at the moment they are doing a lot of unnecessary testing for people with no symptoms and who are at minimal risk of infection. “It’s almost impossible to keep up with the requirements for the testing. And the backlogs are enormous at this present time. We are working with government, but all of the private sector labs have actually been overwhelmed with the requests for testing and most of it has been in very unnecessary testing. We have closed a lot of our drive throughs where people have had some sort of contact and are requesting us for testing, when it is completely unnecessary. So please consult your medical practitioner so that you can be directed properly. All of our resources at the private sector have also been overwhelmed,” says Vardas. South Africa’s cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus cases has jumped to 187 977 after the country reported more than 10 000 new cases since Friday, according to the Department of Health. It also reported a further 74 COVID-19 related deaths, bringing the death toll to 3026. The number of recoveries is at 91 227 translating to a 48,5% recovery rate.
