Members of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Nelson Mandela Bay region have given the National Executive Committee and Provincial Executive Committee 72 hours to intervene in the party’s affairs in the Metro. Representatives of ANC branches picketed outside the party’s regional offices, demanding the disbandment of the Regional Task Team, led by former Mayor Nceba Faku. The Regional Task Team (RTT) was appointed after the ANC Provincial Executive Committee disbanded the regional structure in 2018, citing a decline in membership. The members have accused the RTT of not growing the party, and also of working with the DA to topple the ANC-led coalition in the metro. Ward 33 branch Task Team Member Ayanda Cakasi says lack of structures in the metro might have consequences in the future. “There are no branches in Port Elizabeth and we need to go to BGMS as soon as possible so that we have a stable ANC that will lead towards local government, we take the metro back to the ANC,” says Cakasi.
