The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in KwaZulu-Natal has warned potential bidders around an email that is doing the rounds relating to a tender that was advertised last month. Sassa KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Sandy Godlwana says the email is hoax. She adds that any queries around the correct tender process should be directed to their offices. “[Sassa] condemns a fake email which is circulating on online platforms purporting to request members of the public to contact the regional executives manager for Sassa, Mpumalanga, KZN and Free State Mr Themba Matlou regarding a Sassa Social Relief of Distress bid, which was advertised on government e-tenders,” explains Godlwana. “That tender closed on June 26, 2020. This misinformation is devoid of the truth. The process to appointed service providers has just started and it is only at evaluation process. The agency warns all bidders against this scam, and any other bid where people purport to take money claiming they are from Sassa,” adds Godlwana. Government has confirmed that millions of unemployed people who applied for assistance will receive R350 on the 15th of May. This social grant is temporary and will end in October.
