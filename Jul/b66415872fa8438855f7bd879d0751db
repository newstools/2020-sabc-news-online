Brazilian health regulator Anvisa on Friday approved clinical trials of a potential coronavirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac,according to an official gazette publication. The study – first announced on June 11 – is led by Instituto Butantan, a research center funded by the state of Sao Paulo. The agreement with Sinovac includes not only trials but also the transference of technology to produce the potential vaccine locally. On June 29, Sao Paulo state Governor Joao Doria said 9 000 volunteers have already been registered to test the vaccine against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Trials will be conducted by 12 research centers in six Brazilian states: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Brasilia, Rio Grande do Sul and Parana, according to Doria. Anvisa’s approval comes after Brazil surpassed 1.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to Health Ministry data,the second worst outbreak after the United States. The number of deaths rose by 1 290 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total tally to 63 174, the data showed.
