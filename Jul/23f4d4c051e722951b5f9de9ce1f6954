Oil prices barely moved in early trade on Thursday as positive momentum from signs of a recovery in US gasoline demand was tempered by concerns about renewed lockdowns with COVID-19 infections surging in the United States. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were unchanged at $40.90 a barrel at 0035 GMT, after rising 0.7% on Wednesday. Brent crude LCOc1 futures inched up 3 cents to $43.32, after gaining 0.5% on Wednesday. Oil prices rose on Wednesday as data from the US Energy Information Administration showed US gasoline stockpiles dropped by 4.8 million barrels last week, much more than analysts had expected, as demand climbed to 8.8 million barrels per day, the highest since March 20. However gains were tempered as a spike in COVID-19 cases across several US states raised the prospect of renewed lockdowns holding back the fuel demand recovery. Gasoline demand was falling in areas where lockdowns were being reinstated in the United States, while US demand on the east coast, where coronavirus infections were under control, was recovering well, Shaw said. The United States reported more than 58 000 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the biggest increase ever reported by a country in a single day, with infections climbing in 42 out of 50 states, according to a Reuters tally.
