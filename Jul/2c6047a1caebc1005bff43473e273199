The June and Andrew Mlangeni Foundation has distanced itself from what it calls “internal battles” within the ANC. The remark follows an earlier announcement that former president Jacob Zuma will tonight address the first of a series of virtual memorial services for the late Andrew Mlangeni. Mlangeni was critical of Zuma’s alleged involvement in corruption, which saw billions of rands in public funds looted in State Capture. A trustee of the foundation, Malusi Kekana, says they won’t be drawn into the ANC’s internal affairs but will honour the legacy of Mlangeni in a way they see fit. “What we would not like to do is to take this event of giving ntate Mlangeni an honourable funeral to mar it in controversy due to the current state of affairs. I think as Africans it is a duty for us not to make this funeral as a point of sowing divisions within the African National Congress.” In the video below, ANC pays tribute to Ntate Andrew Mlangeni:  Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize from the Foundation says they will not tolerate any form of corruption in preparing for the funeral of Mlangeni. “Our Foundation has a plea and it’s that powers that be ensure that the procurement processes around baba Mlangeni’s burial are handled in a transparent manner to portray the integrity and dignity that he stood for. It will be appreciated that we don’t hear of any irregularities post the funeral.” Mlangeni died on Tuesday in hospital after being admitted for an abdominal complaint. He was the last surviving Rivonia Trialist who spent 26 years on Robben Island. He was 95. His funeral service will be held at the Soweto Campus of the University of Johannesburg.
