National Treasury says on Sunday it has reviewed the COVID-19 Loan Guarantee Scheme to allow the fund to be easily accessible to businesses. The scheme was created to assist qualifying businesses negatively affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. Treasury said in a statement that some of the changes made include more discretion and less restriction in the bank credit assessments and loan approvals. In the video below, the SABC looks at how businesses will benefit from COVID-19 stimulus package.  Applicants can also now access the loan over a longer period. Funds borrowed from the scheme, through banks, can be used for operational expenses, such as salaries, rent and lease agreements and contracts with suppliers. The loans are granted at a prime rate and repayment may be deferred for a maximum of one year after the loan was taken. Businesses will then be required to repay the loan over five years. Changes implemented Treasury has encouraged qualifying businesses to their primary or main banker for further information on the scheme and the qualifying criteria. Below is the document from National Treasury explaining the Scheme and who it applies to.
