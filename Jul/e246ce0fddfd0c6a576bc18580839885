The South Africa Medical Association (SAMA) says in principle it agrees with the call to close schools during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it cautions that this should only be done in communities with a high number of infections. Teacher unions, National Teachers Union (NATU), South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) and students’ organisation Congress of South African Students (Cosas) have called for schools to close amid the expected COVID-19 peak except for the matric class of 2020. SAMA President Dr Angelique Coetzee says the controlled environment at schools is better suited to protect learners from being infected in communities with a low number of infections. “Yes, where there is a pandemic in certain areas with community outbreak in that area. I will caution against the opening of schools for all learners, but if there is no pandemic or outbreak in a certain community it’s quite safe. It is advisable to send the children back to school, you need to be 1.5 metres apart, you need to wear your mask, you need to wash your hands or sanitise. That is much more controllable in a school environment.” Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga was scheduled to expected to meet with unions on Wednesday to discuss the issue. But, the National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of South Africa (Naptosa) says the meeting has been postponed to an unspecified date.
