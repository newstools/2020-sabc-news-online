The DA has welcomed the amendments to regulations which now allows the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to share information, records or documents directly with any state law-enforcement agency in South Africa. The regulations were gazetted yesterday by President Cyril Ramaphosa. DA Spokesperson on Justice and Correctional Services Glynnis Breytenbach says it will allow law enforcement agencies to act against those who have been implicated in the large-scale looting of state assets. Breytenbach says since the Commission began its work in 2018 there have been no arrests or prosecutions of implicated persons based on information revealed in testimonies because the Commission was prohibited from sharing information obtained through its work. Hours extended Deputy Chief Justice Zondo announced earlier that the hours that the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will run, will be extended.  He granted some postponements to witnesses scheduled to appear before the commission this week. They were from various law enforcement agencies, including former Independent Police Investigative Directorate head, Robert McBride. The commission has a deadline of March next year to finish its work. Zondo who is the commission’s chairperson says that it is important that the deadline is met. “We may have a situation soon where we require people to appear in what I call our evening sessions. That means that you might not be required to present yourself at 9 o’clock or 10 o’clock, but maybe at 4 o’clock and maybe when the witness for the day is done we start with somebody. Maybe we need two hours, three hours and then we are done. So, we go up to 7pm. As I am granting postponements, I just want people to understand that we are in that situation.”
