The Congress of South African Students (Cosas) has called on the Gauteng Education Department to review their strategy on paperless classrooms. This comes after it emerged that many matric learners do not have tablets. The organisation says the program which was launched in 2014 has lost its momentum. Cosas’ President Douglas Ngobeni says the problem seems to be that many matric learners do not return the tablets when they finish school and the tablets have been breaking down. Ngobeni says, “The main challenge now is that some learners do not return those tablets and those who come after them do not receive the tablets, and then it becomes a strain to the Department of Education in Gauteng, so there is a need for a new strategy on how the program can be a continuous process.” A matric learner says they cannot use the tablets effectively at home because they do not have Wi-Fi and the e-books are outdated. “The tablets don’t give us enough resources because the textbooks inside the tablet are old they do not upgrade them, you can’t insert the sim card, it’s hard to study with textbooks that are behind.” In the video below, Gauteng Education opens paperless school:
