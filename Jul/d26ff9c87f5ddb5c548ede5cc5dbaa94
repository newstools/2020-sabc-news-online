Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has emphasised the need for more oxygen tanks at hospitals to help treat patients suffering from serious respiratory infections due to the coronavirus. Mkhize was speaking in a media briefing after visiting hospitals in the Eastern Cape. The province has recorded 67 000 coronavirus cases, of which nearly 50 000 have recovered. At least 1 345 people have died from COVID-19-related illnesses in the Eastern Cape. Mkhize says hospitals must monitor their oxygen levels. “Where they have installed the tanks, we have got the technology to identify the shortage of oxygen long before it affects the hospitals and the replacement can take place before the hospitals are affected. So what I think is important for us is to increase the number of oxygen points in the various parts of the hospitals and bring in cylinders for the areas where there might be a need. It is clear that COVID-19 required first line connection.” The Minister has also noted the shortage of equipment and staff in some of the hospitals in the province.  He says the department is working to address these challenges. “We must reduce the pressure on the existing staff, so the shortage of human resources is going to be addressed as a matter of urgency.” We have also seen the need to upgrade our oxygen supply units at many of the hospitals. We are working closely with the manufacturers to see that oxygen is supplied. #ECVisit23July — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) July 23, 2020  Minister Zweli Mkhize says he is concerned about poor waste management in some of the hospitals:
