Parliament will this week spend a considerable amount of time on the supplementary 2020 Adjustment Budget. Adjusted budgets of several departments and state entities will be submitted for scrutiny and consideration at most committee meetings scheduled for the week. There will be 44 committee meetings for legislative and oversight purposes. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) is scheduled to brief the Home Affairs Committee on its readiness for next year’s municipal elections while the Eastern Cape provincial government will brief the Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs committee on its COVID-19 response plans. The Portfolio Committee on Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs will meet with the City of Cape Town. This is to follow-up on the outcome of investigation into conduct of law enforcement officials during eviction of people who are alleged to have illegally occupied land and set up structures. Both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will also hold plenary meetings.
