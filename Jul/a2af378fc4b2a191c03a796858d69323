The ANC in Gauteng has requested its Provincial Executive Committee members, Bandile Masuku and Khusela Diko to step aside pending investigation into allegations of corruption in the awarding of personal protective equipment (PPE) tenders. Masuku who is the Health MEC is accused of influencing the awarding of a controversial R125 million tender. The ANC says the decision to place Masuku and his wife MMC Loyiso on a leave absence, does not mean the party has found them guilty. #ANCGauteng Khawe:The leave of absence for Loyiso & Dr Masuku as MMC in COJ & MEC of Health is with immediate effect. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/3mowoAGUqA — #TheLordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) July 30, 2020 The couple, along with Presidency Spokesperson Khusela Diko who has stepped aside from her duties, must now appear before the ANC Provincial Integrity Commission. This relates to a controversial R125 million personal protective equipment  (PPE) tender involving Diko’s husband. The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is investigating the matter. Diko and her husband, AmaBhaca King Thandisizwe Diko, have released a joint statement in which they say they regret their decision to do business with government. Provincial Secretary Jacob Khawe has briefed the media following a special PEC meeting convened to discuss the matter. “We took this decision in the interest of clean governance, not as accepting a possibility that these comrades are guilty. What is good with the integrity committee – it’s also a moment of self-correct. We are subjecting our comrades into a proper political process that will defend the integrity of the ANC,” says Khawe.
