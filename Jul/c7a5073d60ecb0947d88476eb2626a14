The North West Co-operative Governance MEC Gordon Kegakilwe has been buried in his home town of Vryburg. He succumbed to COVID-19 related complications on Monday. Some members of the provincial executive and Premier Job Mokgoro could not make it to the funeral as they had to go into self-quarantine. Mokgoro has been admitted to hospital, after also testing positive for the virus, while Public Works MEC Gaoage Molapisi has also tested positive and is in self-isolation. Co-operative Governance Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma delivered the eulogy, virtually, at the funeral. The video below is the funeral service of Gordon Kegakilwe:
