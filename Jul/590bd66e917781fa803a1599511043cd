A Durban based company has been fined R25 000 after pleading guilty to various charges relating to forcing employees to work during the lockdown. The company was reported by an employee for its poor working conditions in particular. Investigations also revealed that the company did not apply for the correct license to manufacture or distribute surgical masks. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson in KwaZulu-Natal, Natasha Kara says the company failed to maintain an environment that is safe for employees… “These charges include forced labour, failure to maintain an environment that is safe without risk to the health of employees, as well as failing to have a license to manufacture, import or act as a wholesaler or distributor of medical devices.” 14 workers – who were allegedly locked up in a factory at Glen Anil – north of Durban since Monday – have been rescued. It’s alleged that the workers were forced to make masks in order to meet the demands caused by Covid-19. #sabcnews — SAfm news (@SAfmnews) March 29, 2020
