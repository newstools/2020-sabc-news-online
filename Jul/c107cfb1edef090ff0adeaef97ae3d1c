The City of Cape Town says protestors have stoned firefighters who were responding to a fire in Khayelitsha. None of the five staff members on board were hurt. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says they are badly shaken up and will need support through the City’s employee wellness programme. Smith says several windows, including the windscreen and both doors of the fire engine, were damaged. “It is counterproductive and in fact, an assault on the most vulnerable communities when some members of the communities actively choose to vandalise resources and assault City staff that works tirelessly to serve that very same community, the fire engine from Lansdawne fire station was en route to informal settlements alight in the area when the vehicle was surrounded along Mew Way and stoned.”
