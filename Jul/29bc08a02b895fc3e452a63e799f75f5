Former Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has told the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg that he wanted to know why there were two IPID reports with different recommendations on whether senior Hawks officials should be suspended for what was allegedly the illegal repatriation of five Zimbabweans in 2010. Nhleko says this motivated him to appoint a so called “reference group” to look into the matter. Former senior Hawks officials Anwa Dramat and Shadrack Sibiya were suspended on the basis of the group’s recommendations. Former IPID Head Robert McBride testified earlier at the Commission that Nhleko used the wrong report, a draft, to suspend the two men. McBride himself was then suspended by Nhleko on allegations that he had altered the initial report to clear Dramat and Sibiya. Nhleko says he had concerns. “The issue raised by the reference group was how come you had one report with the body of it by and large like the other one but with a different set of recommendations as opposed to the second one for an example the first one referred to the implicated people as needed to be prosecuted by in the second one there is then a different recommendation that exonerates those particular people whom are implicated in the first one so the critical question is how did you have such a situation.” In the video below, is Monday’s hearing:  Nhleko has complained about the treatment, he says, he has suffered at the hands of the State Capture Commission. The Former Minister says he did not get various notices and affidavits from the Commission timeously or not at all. He says he heard McBride’s evidence on TV without receiving notice that the evidence implicated him. Speaking through his lawyer William Mkari, Nhleko said he had to threaten the Commission with litigation. Nhleko will cross-examine McBride at a date still to be determined.
