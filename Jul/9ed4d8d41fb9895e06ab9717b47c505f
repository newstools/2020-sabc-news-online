The coronavirus pandemic has brought with it considerable socio-economic challenges and it is the poorest of the poor that is facing the brunt. This has prompted the Nelson Mandela Foundation to launch an emergency relief food system in Potchefstroom in the North West, as part of commemorating Mandela Day. The system is called Each one Feed One where vulnerable communities get food via vouchers from identified grocery stores. Vulnerable communities from around Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp say this is some relief as they have been battling to put food on the table during the pandemic. This initiative will help to put food on the table for many and this all in the name of Madiba. Nelson Mandela Foundation’s Sello Hatang explains, “Because the numbers are really going crazy in terms of the increasing number of infections, we thought it’s prudent that we try and launch this voucher system which is intended to ensure that people continue to get food. The system works on the basis that it has already been paid for and you will see that the value is a total of under a thousand rand that a person gets,” says Hatang. This has brought tears of joy for beneficiaries who received trolleys filled with groceries. “I don’t know what to say about the food I got, I really don’t know, I am so happy I am even helpless, at least at my home we will eat, thank you, I can’t speak right now.” “I am very happy that these groceries are going to help especially our children, we are so grateful for Mandela Day.” People were encouraged to start food gardens to help combat food insecurity. “If we are to do anything we must now begin to implement sustainable projects to deal with food security vegetable garden for an example. We must continue to encourage people to have vegetable gardens, food security is a major major issue of dignity also,” says Hatang. Two thousand beneficiaries in the province have already received assistance.
