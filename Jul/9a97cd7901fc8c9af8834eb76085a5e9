Forensic investigator Paul O’Sullivan has called for all law enforcement officials who have been unlawfully appointed to be removed from their current positions. This comes after former Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane was fired from the South African Police Service. Phahlane was placed on suspension in 2017 on misconduct charges. He is also facing fraud and forgery charges relating to an R 86 million blue lights tender. O’Sullivan says the police service needs to remove corrupt officials. “The wheels have slowly turned, but the sad part is that it has taken 4.5 years to rid the police service of a crooked cop, when it should have taken less than 4.5 months. I am saying that this is evidence that the criminal justice system is still captured and we have to rid the police, not only of Phahlane and his accomplices but of all these generals which have been unlawfully appointed to their current positions because what they have in fact done is infested the police with corrupt criminal cops and we need to get rid of them all.” In the video below, Phahlane says that state institutions are being misused:
