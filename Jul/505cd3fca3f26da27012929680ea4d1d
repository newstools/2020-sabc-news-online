Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has concluded his tour to the Eastern Cape where he inspected health institutions including the Dora Nginza Hospital and Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth. Mkhize’s visit comes after local and international media’s exposé of the appalling conditions at some health institutions. The visit also comes shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 project management unit in the Nelson Mandela District metro. Mkhize says the COVID-19 has put pressure on an already strained health system in the province. He began his day two visit to Nelson Mandela Bay with a meeting with the unions. The unions have expressed a lack of confidence in the health system and Eastern Cape health leadership. The Health Minister said the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases is overwhelming and putting pressure on resources. He said a lack of management has compounded the problem. He is optimistic the newly implemented COVID-19 project management unit will improve things in the province.

We are able because results come from NHLS and NICD, that they get into our system and we latch them. Hence you see that we are able to account for the numbers that we are able to follow and account for numbers and recoveries. Equally, that is why we’re able to see that the numbers are not moving.” Provincial Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba met with health worker unions on Tuesday:
