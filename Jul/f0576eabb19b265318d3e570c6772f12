We are fighting to get our rights back. We are fighting against the farm murders, we are fighting against gender-based-violence and then we are also fighting to get the ban that’s implemented for the alcohol and cigarettes lifted. We have decided on a slow drive because many people say but ‘ja what is the slow drive going to do? You have to do violence.’ I don’t want any person to get hurt. I want to be like that little mosquito that irritates the crap out of you at night when you are trying to sleep.” LIVE: SA #Protests in #CapeTown, #Pretoria, #PortElizabeth, #Boksburg and #Durban | #SouthAfrica #gatvol #LockdownSA #CigaretteBan #SmokersUniteSA #SAProtest •288 watching
