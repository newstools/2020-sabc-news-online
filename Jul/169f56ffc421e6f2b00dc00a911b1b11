The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg will continue to hear evidence related to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) when Judge Tintswalo Makhubela takes the stand on Friday morning. In 2019, activist group UniteBehind laid a complaint with the Judicial Services Commission accusing her of gross misconduct while she was the chairperson of the PRASA interim board. Makhubela is alleged to have interfered with litigation matters related to PRASA’s Siyaya project. Francois Botes, a senior advocate who testified at the commission earlier this month, claimed the judge told him that former president Jacob Zuma had appointed her to sort out the mess at PRASA. The commission cancelled sittings which were scheduled for Wednesday and Thurdsay due to failure to appear by Patrick Gillingham, who was supposed to testify. Gillingham, who is a former Department of Correctional Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO), was on Wednesday expected to testify in response to allegations made by former Bosasa Chief Operation Officer (COO) Angelo Agrizzi of receiving bribes in return for lucrative tenders from the department.  The Commission will on Friday, 24 July 2020 at 10:00 hear evidence relating to allegations of corruption at PRASA from Judge Makhubela.#StateCaptureInquiry — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) July 23, 2020
