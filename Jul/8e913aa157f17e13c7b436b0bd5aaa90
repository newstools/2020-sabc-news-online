Energy analyst Chris Yelland says Eskom’s latest electricity usage figures show that consumers are using lower-than-projected electricity this winter. He says the power utility has not been conducting the necessary deep maintenance protocols at some of their plants as it had earlier promised. Eskom changed from stage 1 to stage 2 load shedding at nine o’clock on Thursday morning. It will continue until ten o’clock on Thursday evening. #POWERALERT 2 Eskom to implement Stage 1 loadshedding from 09:00 until 14:00 tomorrow, then move to

Yelland projects that intermittent load shedding will continue into next year. “I believe we can expect intermittent load-shedding for the next 18 months. It’s not me that’s saying that, it’s Eskom that’s telling us that the equipment needs deep level maintenance and until they do that maintenance they are going to have problems. When you do a deep level maintenance you have to take generators out of service for typically two to three months. So while you are doing the maintenance, a lot of generators are not available to service.” In the video below, Eskom says stage 2 load shedding will continue:
