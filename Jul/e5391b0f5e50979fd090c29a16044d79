Eskom has implemented Stage 2 load shedding which started at midday. This is due to an increase in plant breakdowns leading to the loss of more than 3000 megawatts of capacity. The power utility’s spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says the constrained supply may persist throughout this weekend. “Eskom regrets to inform the public that it will implement Stage 2 load shedding starting at 12 this afternoon. This will continue until 10 o’clock tonight. This load shedding has been caused by an increase in plant breakdowns exceeding 3 000 MW of capacity. Eskom is working hard to return as many of these generation units to service. While five generation units were taken off the grid last night and this morning, a breakdown at the Matimba power station has today resulted in the need for load shedding.” #Update #MediaAlert #Loadshedding City Power implements Stage 2 Load shedding today^GR pic.twitter.com/m18YvYODJz — @CityPowerJhb (@CityPowerJhb) July 10, 2020  #Update #Loadshedding Stage 2 load shedding to be implemented from 12:00 until 22:00. 12:00- 16:30 Block 3B and 7B
