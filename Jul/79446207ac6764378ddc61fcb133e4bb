The Netcare Hospital Group’s Director of Strategy and Health Policy, Melanie da Costa says the service level agreements which the private hospital sector signed with the public healthcare sector have given the industry an opportunity to engage and be pro-active. As part of the private-public partnership, various private hospitals will treat COVID-19 patients if public hospitals reach capacity. Government will subsidise the cost of treatment for those patients, with a maximum of R16 000 per patient. Da Costa was speaking during a virtual sitting of the Western Cape Parliament’s Ad hoc Committee on COVID-19 where they discussed the province’s health care system. She says the private hospital sector is ready to assist with fighting COVID-19. “To date, we’ve only seen a handful of transfers coming through to the private sector. Since early July, pressure on the system has alleviated somewhat, but nonetheless, we stand ready and at your side to deal with this pandemic.” According to the Western Cape government’s COVID-19 dashboard, the province currently has around 14 900 active COVID-19 cases. Around 86 000 confirmed cases have been recorded in the province so far with around 71 000 recoveries. Around 2 700 people have died from the virus while just over 384 000 tests have been conducted in the province.
