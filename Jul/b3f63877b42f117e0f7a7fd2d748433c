The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed that its spokesperson Ricardo Mthembu died of COVID-19 related complications. Mthembu died this morning in a Durban hospital. The party says he spent two weeks in hospital battling the disease. Mthembu was also a member of the provincial legislature and former Mayor the KwaDukuza Municipality. ANC KwaZulu-Natal Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says Mthembu fought until the end. “I can confirm that comrade Ricardo … it is quite correct that he tested positive of COVID-19. That’s why I am saying that when we are waging this war, we must not be despondent only because some of our greatest soldiers are falling. As we move along, I think that is what the spirit of comrade Ricardo, and many others like him … it’s what must propel us to move forward. We must embrace that fighting spirit. He has been in the hospital for more than two weeks. It demonstrated the level of courage and tenacity that he had. To stay in hospital and stay in the machine and ventilators for such a long time, it shows that this was a comrade who was determined to fight.”
