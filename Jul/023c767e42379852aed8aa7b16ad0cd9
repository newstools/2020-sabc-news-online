The Hawks in Mahikeng, in the North West, have arrested 17 people for allegedly burning government offices in the town. The group is accused of torching the offices belonging to the Head of the Department of Economic Development and his personal assistant. The Hawks Spokesperson Tlangelani Rikhotso says the suspects will appear in court on Wednesday. “Seventeen suspects have been arrested by the Hawks assisted by the member of taxes, crime intelligence and TRT on Monday in Mahikeng, for allegedly setting the offices on fire at the Department of Economic Affairs. All the suspects are expected to appear on Wednesday at the Mmabatho Magistrate’s Court and they will face charges of arson.” Meanwhile, Departmental Spokesperson Dumisa Seshabela says they are yet to establish the reason for burning the offices allegedly by service providers who do business with the provincial government. “At the moment we do not know the extend of damage. We are still waiting to get the report. The police and fire brigade were on the ground trying to distinguish the fire and at the moment I cannot tell you what made those tender men [suspects] to burn the department,” explains Seshabela.
