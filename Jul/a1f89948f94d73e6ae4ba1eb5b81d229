Police in KwaZulu-Natal are investigating the killing of four women in Umzumbe on the south coast. Their decomposed bodies were found in a sugarcane field between late last year and early this month. The victims, aged between 16 and 30, were naked with multiple stab wounds. The bodies of Neli Dube, Baja Ndwalane, and Gumede siblings Nosipho and Akhona were found in the cane field. Locals believe a serial killer could be on the loose:   Young girls talk of a suspicious vehicle driving around and chasing after them. Dube’s family claims Neli’s body had parts missing. Sthembile Dube, Neli’s sister says: “We are suspicious of a vehicle seen in this area chasing after young women. This points out the fact that we are no longer safe and free from walking. We cannot even get out of our homes.” Fear has gripped the relatively quiet uMzumbe area. Ugu district PR Councillor Leonard Ngcobo says: “There’s great fear in the community. When you drive around here in the community, you find out that people, especially, the females they go in pairs and in trios. There is no one who is brave enough to go alone.” High ranking police officers have been roped in to investigate the murders. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Col. Thembeka Mbhele says: “Police are working tirelessly to find out the circumstances around. When they were found they were beyond recognition and on the 28th of June 23-year-old female from Nomakhazana area was also found and her slightly decomposed body was found by the hunter. She had a stab wound on her chest.” All the bodies were found by the hunters. “No one has been arrested as yet. Police say they are investigating if the killings are linked and that the Modus Operandi is the same.
