The case against 31-year-old Muzikayise Malephane, who is accused of the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule, has been moved to the High Court in Johannesburg. This is due to the serious nature of the case. The case was expected to resume this morning at the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court. Malephane was arrested in June – a few days after Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was found hanging from a tree with multiple stab wounds. He faces charges of premeditated murder. “It’s postponed to the 29/09/2020 for DNA results and criminal investigation. It will not be postponed to this court because the matter has been identified as a High Court matter due to its serious nature. A court will prepare the letter for the High Court until such time that we make a decision and then it will be transferred to the High Court,” Magistrate John Baloyi said while announcing the postponement. Pule’s uncle, Tumisang Katake, has commended the police for their investigations. “There is nothing that I can fault that the police have done so far. They have been doing an excellent job, keeping us informed about what is happening and then also telling us what they are going to do. I wouldn’t be surprised if they make other arrests as well. I don’t think – it is my opinion – but I don’t think it was just one guy that murdered Tshegofatso,” he said. Pule’s murder renewed calls for men to join the fight against gender-based violence:  Pule’s murder sparked a public outcry, which culminated in a march on June 16 amid a surge in gender-based violence (GBV) incidents. There have also been calls for harsher sentences for perpetrators of GBV. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said at least 51% of women in the country have experienced violence at the hands of a loved one.
