SA to remain on alert Level 3 Presisdent Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said that after deliberation, the National Coronavirus Command Council has decided not to move the country into a higher lockdown level as this will not affect the peak of the virus and for its economic impact. As a result, the county remains on Level 3. The President says everything possible needs to be done to contain the virus that has now infected more than a quarter of a million South Africans. He has criticised those who are not complying with implemented measures. He says many of the deaths have occurred after people attended gatherings, funerals and house parties, adding there are now 500 infections every hour in South Africa. “And we know that many more infections have gone undetected. As of this evening, there are 276 242 that are confirmed cases in our country. We are now recording well over 12 000 new cases every day. That is the equivalent of 500 new infections every hour of the day.” In the video below, President Cyril Ramaphosa announces that SA will remain in alert Level 3:
