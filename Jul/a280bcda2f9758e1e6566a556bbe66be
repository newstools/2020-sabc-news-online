Former Commissioner of Correctional Services Linda Mti and former BOSASA COO Angelo Agrizzi along with two others have appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. Mti, Agrizzi, former Correctional Services CFO Patrick Gillingham and BOSASA CFO Andries Van Tonder are charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, corruption and money laundering. The matter relates to tenders amounting to over R1,8-billion between August 2004 to 2007. All four have been released on R20 000 bail each and the matter was postponed to October 16. Head of the Investigating Directorate, Hermione Cronje, says more arrests are expected. She says BOSASA along with its subsidiaries and affiliates secured tenders worth more than R34-billion in government contracts even after the irregularities in the initial four tenders came to light in 2010. pic.twitter.com/iA79RID1TX — NPASouthAfrica (@NPA_Prosecutes) July 29, 2020  The video below is on the wrap of Agrizzi’s State Capture testimony:
