The family of the late South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela, says it has noted attempts by two individuals – claiming to be close relatives – to get monetary compensation. The two men are alleged to have approached various entities including her employer the Department of International Relations attempting to claim money as a death benefit. Mandela died in Johannesburg last week at the age of 59. Her family said she had tested positive for the coronavirus. In a sombre statement, the Mandela family condemns the behaviour of the two gentlemen – describing it as devoid of humanity. They say they will deal with the matter privately in order not to validate the attention seeking antics by the pair. The family also took the opportunity to express their gratitude to South Africans for their support during their difficult period. “We appreciate your kind words and for elevating the immense contributions Mama Zindzi made in service to her country,” the statement reads. Mandela was been buried next to her mother, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, at Fourways Memorial Park in Johannesburg. The political activist was the youngest daughter of struggle stalwarts Nelson Mandela and Madikizela-Mandela. Her funeral service was held inside a chapel and the burial was private.
