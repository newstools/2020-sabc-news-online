Eskom has warned that there may be delays in restoring power to areas without electricity. It says there are high volumes of failed equipment in areas with illegal connections. This comes as the power utility has implemented load reduction in many parts of Soweto and the Vaal. Gauteng Eskom Spokesperson Reneiloe Semenya says: “Due to high volumes of repeated failures on transformers and mini substations in areas associated with illegal connections, meter bypasses and vandalism of electricity infrastructure there may be delays in restoration of supply due to resource constraints.” “It may take up to three months from the day of payment arrangements. We would like to appeal to all members of the public to please switch off all non-essential appliances and avoid illegal operations and illegal operations.” On Wednesday, Eskom urged customers to use electricity sparingly after two generation units tripped at the Medupi and Tutuka power stations. #PowerAlert 1Generation system is severely constrained as two generation units trip@News24 @eNCA pic.twitter.com/YMey5O6mfw — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) July 7, 2020  The power utility says the trip led to a constraint in the power generating system and has warned that the constrained power supply may persist throughout the weekend.
