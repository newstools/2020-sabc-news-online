The Eastern Cape Health Department handed over a house to the Cikiso family in Mount Fletcher. The last six months were trying times for the Cikiso family. Seventy-eight-year-old Nomthetho Cikiso and her three grandchildren had to cope in a shack, after her rondavel was reduced to ashes in December. They do not have water or electricity. Cikiso was in the process of building a mud house, when the Health Department stepped in. “I lived in a shack. It was tough during rainy days. We would spend the whole night standing up and by morning, we would be soaking wet, but I told myself I will not go anywhere.” Keeping the Madiba magic alive, from a shack to a fully furnished house. “I feel so happy because I’ll sleep in a house like other people. Ever since I was young, I’ve never slept in a new bed. I didn’t have a stove or refrigerator.” The Health Department says people need proper shelter to help protect them. Eastern Cape Health MEC, Sindiswa Gomba, says, “In this time of COVID, and that we are at the peak level and because of the cold nature of the season, it is important they move from the shack to a warmer house that is going to assist them in blocking the virus.” Traditional Leader Chief, Moenki Moshweshwe, “I’m glad to witness service delivery for a needy indigent family and we are thankful they received a house of this calibar.” With many people having lost their jobs due to COVID-19, It’s hoped Good Samaritans will bring much-needed relief this Mandela Month. In the video, the family expresses their delight at the new house:
