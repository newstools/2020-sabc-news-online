The United Democratic Movement (UDM) says the implementation of load shedding during this disastrous time is a disgrace and an indictment on Eskom and government. UDM Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa says it is vital the sick and the people infected with the coronavirus keep warm as temperatures plummet. “It is disgraceful for Eskom to embark upon load shedding at a time when South Africa needs all the energy that it can get in order to be able to care for the sick and those who are infected by the coronavirus. And this is a time when the basic health care system in its totality and South Africans who have quarantined at home, need energy so that they can keep warm, need energy so that they can fight against the coronavirus. It’s a damning indictment on the leadership of Eskom and that of government than even during this difficult time, Eskom has not been able to keep the lights on.” Eskom resumed Stage 2 load shedding a short while ago after downgrading it to Stage 1 earlier. The power utility says electricity consumption has increased due to the cold weather. #POWERALERT 1 Eskom to implement Stage 2 loadshedding from 14:00 until 22:00 as electricity usage surgesin cold weather pic.twitter.com/xO5unuw3yC — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) July 15, 2020
