The United Front for School Governing Bodies (UF4SGBs) has taken a decision to close schools in Ekurhuleni North and Gauteng districts until September 7.

Most of the non-negotiables have been partially met.” School Governing Body association is demanding for amongst other things for proper scanners and well-trained brigades, and more teachers and classrooms.
