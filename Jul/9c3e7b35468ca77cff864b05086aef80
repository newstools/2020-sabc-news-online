The Netcare Group says they are anticipating an increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 patients in the coming weeks. In a statement, Netcare says all their hospitals are experiencing a significant increase in demand for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, especially in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng. In a statement, Managing Director Jacques du Plessis has disputed information that’s been circulating on social media alleging that certain Netcare hospitals have been closed or that patients are being turned away from some emergency departments. He says they currently do have capacity to treat both COVID-19 and other patients in their critical units and general wards. Du Plessis says they are constantly assessing the demand for hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients, expecting the demand to rise in the coming days.
