The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Thursday hear testimony related to South African Airways (SAA) from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) auditor Pule Mothibe. SAA appointed PwC and Nkonki and Associates as its external auditors between 2012 to 2015. In the video below, State Capture turns to SAA:  The Auditor-General picked up a number of issues with SAA’s supply chain management processes and decided that the national carrier’s financials be edited by his office. The Commission also focused on PwC earlier this year when its forensic auditor, Trevor White, testified on how politically-connected businessman Toshan Panday gave KZN police staff in the supply chain management department gifts and bribes to secure 2010 World Cup deals.
