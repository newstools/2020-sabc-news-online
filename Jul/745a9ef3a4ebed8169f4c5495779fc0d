The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) in Tshwane says its members were promised increases prior to the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Workers demonstrated outside Tshwane House this week – with some calling for the head administrator Mpho Nawa to vacate office. Nawa has reiterated that the City cannot afford pay-outs due to the negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Regional Samwu chairperson Nkhetheni Muthavhi, has outlined reasons for the protest – saying that they are demanding to see proof of benchmarking payments. “People are not going to eat morality, they are going to eat money. The 6.25 that we are saying must be implemented, the municipality was supposed to do it. We have agreed with the municipality that they were going to implement. On the 16th July they said they don’t have money, but all along they said they were going to implement. When did the money disappear,” asks Muthavhi.
