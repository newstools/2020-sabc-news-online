Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has attributed ill-discipline by citizens to the rising number of COVID-19 infections in the country. In the three weeks since Kenyatta announced a phased re-opening of the country’s economy, the number of positive coronavirus cases has doubled from 8 067 at the beginning of the month to over 17 600 on Monday. So far, 280 people have also lost their lives. Kenyatta warned that the country risked losing its war against the virus unless there is a change of attitude among Kenyans. “We mourn the 280 Kenyans lost to this cruel virus as of yesterday. Unfortunately, there will be more. The only question is whether we shall emerge with a low number of deaths or shall suffer a catastrophe. We also understand that our economic health as a country is ultimately tied to keeping our infections and fatalities as low as possible.” 10th Presidential address on #Covid19 pandemic.#KomeshaCorona pic.twitter.com/yaqmdcQEzX — State House Kenya (@StateHouseKenya) July 28, 2020  Ban on alcohol sales Kenyatta announced a ban on the sale of alcohol in restaurants.
