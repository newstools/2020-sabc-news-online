Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, returns to Nelson Mandela Bay on Wednesday to assess the interventions at the Metro’s two major hospitals, Livingstone and Dora Nginza. The MEC for Health, Sindiswa Gomba, met with health worker unions on Tuesday to try and find solutions to some of the labour challenges at these hospitals. The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro has the most coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the province with 17 000 infections. Gomba says the South African National Defence Force’s (SANDF) medical team that was deployed to the province last month is providing much-needed help to the medical staff at hospitals across the province.
