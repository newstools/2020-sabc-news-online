Two police stations in the Free State have been closed after members tested positive for COVID-19. Police spokesperson Motantsi Makhele says the telephone lines at Batho Police Station Community Service Centre in Bloemfontein will no longer be accessible. Community members requiring police assistance and emergencies have been advised to call 10111. Another police station in Theunissen was closed after a confirmed case of COVID-19. Both police stations will be decontaminated during the closure and affected members will undergo necessary COVID-19 related protocols. Makhele says the communities will be informed once the stations are operational again. In June, Police Minister Bheki Cele confirmed that 1 685 law enforcement officers had tested positive for the COVID-19, with 14 officers having died from the coronavirus. “We as the South African police, as you know, we are in the frontline and we still suffer. We’ve got about 1 685 members nationally that have been affected, unfortunately, a big part of them are in the Western Cape at 1 034,” said the Police Minister. “In Gauteng, we’ve got 119, in the Eastern Cape 186, KZN we’ve got 53 with 14 deaths altogether, and we are saluting those that are dying on the frontline, trying to defend and to make sure that all South Africans are safe,” he added.
