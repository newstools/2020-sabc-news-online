King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo says the court judgment which has validated him as the AbaThembu King will serve as a catalyst to start the process of uniting the AbaThembu people. The High Court in Mthatha, Eastern Cape dismissed Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo’s application. He brought an urgent court application following his abrupt removal from the throne, by Premier Oscar Mabuyane. King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo’s Spokesperson, Prince Mthunzi Ngonyama, says the AbaThembu people will draw important lessons from the court decision. “We appreciate the dedication and the work done by our lawyers and we welcome the judgement that we’ve received today. There was no basis to it in the first place, just taking chances and now we have a task to unite the kingdom and move forward with his operation to serve the people. We have been together handing over petitions, we really appreciate your support,” says Ngonyama. Dalindyebo’s attack on family In March, Dalindyebo was arrested at the Bumbane Great Place in Mthatha after he allegedly went on a rampage, attacking family members with pangas, bush knives and axes. He also demanded that his son, Azenathi leave. Dalindyebo consequently requested all his children, including then-acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo , to undergo DNA tests to prove that they are indeed his children. In March, King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo was arrested following an attack on his family:  King Dalindyebo was released on parole at the end of 2019 as a result of a special remission of sentence by President Cyril Ramaphosa. He had been convicted in 2015 for several crimes including seven counts of kidnapping, three of assault, three of arson and one of defeating the ends of justice.
