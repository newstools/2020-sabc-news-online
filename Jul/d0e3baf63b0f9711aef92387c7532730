The City of Tshwane has ceased providing emergency medical services (EMS) after the Gauteng Health Department declined to approve their operating license. The City has requested that residents require EMS assistance to call the provincial services number on 10177. City Tshwane EMS spokesperson Charles Mabaso says their ambulance services will not be operational. Mabaso says, â€œWe would not be responding to emergency medical incidents, but we will continue to respond to fire and rescue incidents and any other incidents that we are required to respond to. Our personnel will continue to offer treatment when they come across people that require medical intervention because they are required and trained to do so. The preparations are in order to ensure the residents do not suffer based on this matter. City of Tshwane temporarily stops ambulance services:
