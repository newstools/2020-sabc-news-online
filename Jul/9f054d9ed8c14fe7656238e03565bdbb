KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has assigned three MECs to ensure that the smoldering fire at a landfill site in the Msunduzi Municipality in Pietermaritzburg is extinguished. Last week, residents at Msunduzi Municipality were again left gasping for clean air after the New England Road landfill site caught fire, blanketing the city center and suburbs with thick smoke and fumes. The fire forced several schools to close. A group, including representatives from schools, protested close to the landfill site after yet another fire broke out. Zikalala says they hope to find a lasting solution for the problem. “We wish to express our deep concern about the situation that has developed in uMsunduzi Municipality, where smoke from the burning dumpsite has polluted the entire area and is posing a health risk to the residents. In this period when we are dealing with a crisis like COVID-19, we do not want our people to get sick and occupy hospital beds due to avoidable causes of illness. This is a matter we are attending with a deep sense of urgency. We believe that the time has come for its permanent resolution.”  #KZN_Fire_Alert Fire 1: Shogweni Team at the Msunduzi Landfill Site Fire still ongoing.
