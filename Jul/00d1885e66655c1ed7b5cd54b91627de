The MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs in the North West, Gordon Kegakilwe, will be given a state funeral on Friday. Kegakilwe will be laid to rest at his hometown of Vryburg. He succumbed to COVID-19 related complications on Monday after testing positive for the coronavirus last week. “We will observe as much as possible to the latter COVID-19 regulations and we will do whatever we can not to transgress them. So we will hear what the mortuary will do and we will follow what they say. Hence we are saying it must be as private as possible and be virtual so that people can attend the virtual way,” says Dr Godisamang Kegakilwe, Family spokesperson. Kegakilwe was appointed as CoGTA MEC, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs MEC in 2019 following the National and Provincial Elections. In a statement, CoGTA Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says Kegakilwe understood the importance of the portfolio and carried out its responsibilities with dignity and that they had established a good working relationship in this past year that they have worked together. “MEC Kegakilwe was passionate about the issues affecting the poor and the most vulnerable section of the population. He was a committed activist who has served the province in various roles before his appointment as the MEC role,” says Dlamini-Zuma.
