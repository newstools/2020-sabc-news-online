EDITORIAL NOTE: In our earlier story, we used “unaccounted” instead of “unknown”. We have since reangled the story and adjusted the headline.

The Western Cape still accounts for the most deaths provincially, having recorded 2 875 COVID-19 related deaths. On Sunday, the Health Department recorded 50 so-called unknown cases. This reflects the number of people whose results are positive, but whose physical addresses are still being verified. The Minister has passed his condolences to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives to the virus and thanked the healthcare workers who daily risk their lives in the fight to combat the pandemic.
“This fight is about us behaving differently to how we did before COVID-19. There is now a new way of living. We need to say ‘I will make sure that I am protecting others, by protecting myself too,'” Mkhize said.
