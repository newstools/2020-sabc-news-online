An expert from the Centre for Infectious Diseases Professor Andrew Boulle says the Western Cape has not yet reached its coronavirus peak. He was speaking in an online briefing with provincial government leaders. The province has recorded more than 1 900 COVID-19 related deaths, the highest in the country. Boulle says this high number of deaths has not been seen since the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. “We are seeing a crisis of some proportions, so I’ve pointed out this very unusual mortality pattern which is really quite unprecedented except for these exceptional circumstances. If the Western Cape were a country and were compared to other countries, at this point in time globally we might be one of the countries with the highest currently daily mortality rate per million populations in the world.” In the video below, President Cyril Ramaphosa acknowledges Western Cape challenges and successes:  Over 700 teachers test positive for COVID-19 More than 700 teachers and just under 90 learners have tested positive for COVID-19 in the province.
