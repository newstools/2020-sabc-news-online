He says demand for beds in private and public hospitals is overwhelming. “These figures have over the past week alone have grown exponentially. This presents the biggest jump to date, which once again bares testimony to the fact that we are on our way towards reaching our peak on COVID-19 in the province.” Zikalala has spoken out against the reckless behaviour of those who believe that the virus does not exist, saying this fallacy will increase infection rates even further. “This is merely on the basis that they do not know anyone who has died because of this disease. We want to strongly denounce this kind of thinking because it causes the risk of increasing the rate of transmission due to reckless behaviour. COVID-19 is here and we all need to be vigilante. It’s deadly and it will cause unprecedented devastation if we do not change the way we behave.” In the video below, Zikalala warns those that violate COVID-19 lockdown regulations:  KwaZulu-Natal has the fourth highest numbers of COVID-19 infections in South Africa.
