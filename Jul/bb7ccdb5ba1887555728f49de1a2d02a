President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Spokesperson, Khusela Diko, and her husband, King Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko have reiterated that there was no corruption in the Gauteng Health Department’s awarding of  R125 million tender to the king. They, however, regret the error of judgment that led to the king’s Royal Bhaca company doing business with the department. The contract has subsequently been cancelled. The news of the tender for the supply of personal protective gear during the coronavirus pandemic sparked outrage from the public. Khusela Diko has since taken leave of absence from her position pending an investigation into contract. The couple says in a joint statement that they have never tried to hide their ties with the family of Gauteng MEC of Health, Dr. Bandile Masuku. They, however, understand that it raises suspicion due to the impact state capture and corruption had on the depletion of state coffers. They say they support the measures that the government has put in place to investigate and prosecute all instances of the misuse of funds meant for a response to COVID-19. The king has also denied that his appointment as an independent Audit Committee member of the Johannesburg Market was due to unwarranted political influence but has chosen to resign from the position.
