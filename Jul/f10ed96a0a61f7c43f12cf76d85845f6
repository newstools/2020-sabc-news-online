United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa says the looting of COVID-19 funds does not come as a surprise because corruption is currently institutionalised by the ANC administration. This follows the scandal involving President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Spokesperson Khusela Diko‘s husband King Madzikane Diko. The company in which her husband is a director, Bhaca Royal Projects, was awarded a tender by Gauteng’s Health Department for the provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This also saw Health MEC Bandile Masuku being placed on temporary leave to allow the investigation to continue. Masuku’s wife, Loyiso, is also implicated in the tender scandal. In this video below, SABC News Reporter Samkelo Maseko discusses the PPE scandal that got official put on special leave:  ‘Institutionalised corruption’ Holomisa says, “One is not surprised given that the comrades in corruption have been looting the resources of this country with impunity. This institutionalised corruption has even compromised the institution of this country such as law enforcement agencies.” “Those law enforcement agencies may appear toothless because in the first instance because these are cadres that have been deployed from the same party – a party which claims to have liberated us. But we are still yet to enjoy the fruits of that liberation.” An African National Congress (ANC) MP claims that three party members taking leave of absence following allegations of tender impropriety for COVID-19 PPEs in Gauteng are evidence of renewal of the party. Diko took leave of absence pending investigations. The tender was awarded to a company in which her husband is a director.
