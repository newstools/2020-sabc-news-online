In addition to the 13 schools, our Namaqua District Office has also been closed due to a confirmed positive case.

He says more than 61 000 learners in the province will be returning to school. “Learners from Grade R, 6 and 11 are set to return on Monday, 6th of July 2020 and the necessary preparatory work by the department has been done in this regard. During this phase, 61 881 learners will return to school. To ensure that all schools adhere to the COVID-19 regulations and guidelines, schools were given the options to phase in learners: platooning, alternating days per week, bi-weekly rotational attendance and the hybrid model,” says Van der Merwe.
