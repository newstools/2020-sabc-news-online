Deputy President David Mabuza will be unable to attend his two engagements on Thursday with the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces due to what he says is ill health. This has been revealed by Speaker Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson Amos Masondo. Parliament spokespersons Moloto Mothapo says, “Both the Speaker of the National Assembly and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces have received a letter of apology from the Deputy President who was scheduled to appear before the NCOP on Thursday for response to oral questions from the member of that House.” “He was also to appear before the National Assembly next week Thursday for the same purpose. The Deputy President has indicated to the presiding officers of both houses that he is unable to honour scheduled appearance to Parliament due to ill health,” explains Mothapo.
