The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Monday heard evidence from a Bosasa-linked private contractor Charl Le Roux. Le Roux installed generators and did some electrical work in the house of former Water and Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. His evidence follows testimony given by former Bosasa boss, Angelo Agrizzi, last year, that they paid some ministers and maintained and upgraded their homes as kickbacks for corrupt deals. Evidence leader, Viwe Notshe, told Justice Raymond Zondo that he had visited Mokonyane’s home on Sunday to identify certain features that were identified by Le Roux in his testimony. Mokonyane has denied that she had received payments from Bosasa to give the company government’s contracts.  The contractor identified creation features in the former Minister’s house including a guardhouse. Le Roux says he had visited the same exact house regularly in Krugersdorp five years ago to do some electrical, water features repairs, and a backup power system installation. At the time, Le Roux was employed as an apprentice by an electrical company that was the recipient of numerous Bosasa contracts between 2014 and 2015. The Commission will resume its hearings on Thursday. Below is Charl Le Roux’s testimony:
