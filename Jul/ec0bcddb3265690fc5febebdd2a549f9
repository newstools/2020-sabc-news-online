A tug of war has erupted between AfriForum and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) over the decades-old One Settler, One Bullet slogan of the Pan Africanists. AfriForum has laid a criminal charge of incitement to violence, arguing that the slogan is a call for violence against the minorities. The PAC, however, says this is the heritage of its armed-wing, APLA. “How on earth will the PAC begin to explain the shooting of people…we can ill-afford such violence to minorities or anybody else to be shot at?,” AfriForum’s Ernst van Zyl asks. The PAC is digging on its heels. It says ‘One Settler, One Bullet’ is going nowhere. “If Afriforum wants to contest this slogan in court, it must know that…if they still regard themselves as settlers, then we will meet at the battle field,” says the PAC’s Mzwanele Nyhontsho. Now the matter is in the hands of the police and it still unclear whether they will refer the issue to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) or not. Here is a response from the PAC @MyPAConline.
