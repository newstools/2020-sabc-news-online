Finance Minister Tito Mboweni says National Treasury will approach the World Bank for additional funding. This follows the approval of a R70 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mboweni briefed a virtual meeting of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on the Adjustment Appropriation Bill, which was approved by the National Assembly (NA) yesterday. COVID-19 has turned the country on its head and the economy is set to shrink by as much as 7.5% of GDP. This will result in a revenue shortfall of about R304 billion. Mboweni says government has to plug the gap as expenditure plans exceeds revenue collection. He says the country’s fiscus is in a “very serious” situation and we must internalise the difficulties. The minister says they have already got a billion dollar loan from the BRICS bank and R5 billion from the African Development Bank.
