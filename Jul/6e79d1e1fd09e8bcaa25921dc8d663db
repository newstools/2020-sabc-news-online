The first drive-through COVID-19 testing centre in Tshwane has opened at the SuperSport Stadium in Centurion.  The private healthcare drive-through centre allows people to be tested for the coronavirus while sitting in their cars. The tests cost R1 190 and the results are mailed or sms’ed within three to five working days. Sister Kolofelo Chauke mans the centre together with two colleagues. The results are communicated to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NCID). Chauke says people prefer the drive-through option because they do not get into contact with anyone. “When they come in they go to the first station there. That’s where we do the screening like if they have been in contact, referred to, have symptoms, because else you won’t be tested. We don’t just test anybody. You need to qualify to do the test.” Gauteng accounts for 36.6% of the total number of coronavirus in South Africa with 136 879. The facility will only test symptomatic people, those exposed to confirmed cases, or referred to the facility by a medical practitioner.
