Eskom says it has reached agreements with four municipalities from the Northern Cape that were due for scheduled electricity supply interruptions from Wednesday due to outstanding debts. The Kamiesberg, Khai-Ma and Richtersveld Local Municipalities have made a payment agreement with the power utility while the Tsantsabane Local Municipality reached an interim agreement with Eskom. However, the Magareng Local Municipality failed to make a satisfactory payment agreement with Eskom and the power utility will proceed with power cuts in the municipality from Wednesday. Eskom said on Tuesday that the five municipalities owe more than R200 million and unlike other municipalities in the province, they have failed to honour their payment arrangements.
