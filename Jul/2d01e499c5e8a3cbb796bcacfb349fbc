Minister of Mineral Resource and Energy Gwede Mantashe has been discharged from hospital on Sunday evening after he was earlier this week admitted to hospital after contracting coronavirus (COVID-19). Mantashe is one of six cabinet Minister to test positive for the novel coronavirus – the latest being Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel after receiving his results on Saturday night. In a statement from the cabinet, Mantashe will stay at home for another seven days. “Though he has been discharged, he has been advised by his medical team to stay home for another seven days. We are grateful that Minister Mantashe is now at home with his family and on his way to a full recovery,” reads the statement in part.
