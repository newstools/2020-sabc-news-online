The reports come as the province overtook the Western Cape as epicentre of coronavirus infections in the country, with over 60 000 confirmed cases. The province has recorded 8 810 new infections in the last 24 hours.

The over a million grave refers to the collective capacity municipalities can take in Gauteng.” “Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku visited one of the graves in Tshwane yesterday. The gravesite visited has the capacity of 24 000. The Gauteng department of Health is continuing to improve and increase both the infrastructure and human resource capacity of the health system to deal with increasing pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. We understand that the subject of death is an unfortunate matter to engage in,” adds Kekana.
