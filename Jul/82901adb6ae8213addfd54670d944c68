The Cape Coloured People’s Congress has vowed to bring the City of Cape Town Metro to a standstill on Monday with protests that it says, could turn violent. SABC News has seen a letter circulating on social media in which one of the law enforcement bodies warn that the protests could start as early as 04:00 on Monday morning. Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato has urged the police to prevent the planned shutdown, saying the organisers intend to terrorise law-abiding residents. The People’s Congress says the protest is, among others things against poor service delivery in coloured communities and unemployment. A warning has been given in the letter that road closures could be seen on the N1, N2, R300 and the N7. People travelling on these routes are warned to expect delays and be aware of possible stone throwing and petrol bombing. A further warning is given that while Houtbay and Khayelitsha are the hotspot for land occupation, this could spread to areas such as Mannenberg, Eeste Rivier, Masiphumelele and Mitchell’s Plain. Possible intimidation on public transport could also be expected.
