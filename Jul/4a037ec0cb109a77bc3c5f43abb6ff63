Basic education in Kenya will resume in January next year when the COVID-19 curve is expected to flatten, the country’s education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Magoha announced on Thursday a day after the country’s President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a phased reopening of the country. The ministry has settled for January next year for both Primary and Secondary schools, in a historic first for the country, there will be no national examinations this year. Magoha says schools should only reopen when the daily percentage of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases have reduced consistently for at least 14 days – which is evidence that the country has passed the peak. Schools will now use this time to put in place protocols on reducing physical contact and ensuring high levels of hygiene.  Kenya currently has over 8 000 cases the highest in the East African region. Prof. Magoha says reducing physical contact in learning institutions by having fewer learners will have a great impact on reducing COVID-19 cases and fatalities associated with reopening of learning institutions. Prof. Magoha announced that universities and tertiary institutions will begin reopening in September this year after meeting all health requirements to prevent the spread of the disease.
