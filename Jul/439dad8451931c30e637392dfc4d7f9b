Eighteen Parliamentary staff members have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. In response to SABC News, Parliament says it has not been immune from coronavirus infections. In April, 60 year old Amos Komeni, a Project Administrator in the office of the Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli since May 2014, died of COVID-19 complications. Komeni, who was famously known as Bra A, was 60 years old. “This invisible enemy has robbed us of a humble gentle giant, a dignified professional who was a role model for many younger employees. He was a gentleman who always went beyond the call of duty. He was an also activist who dedicated his efforts and time in various community upliftment projects. He served in various structures and was an active member of the South African Communist Party,” said Tsenoli on Komeni’s passing. COVID-19 cases in Parliament come amid news that five cabinet members, including Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi, have also tested positive. Parliament says the 18 staff members who tested positive for COVID-19 since April are officials of Parliament. Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says 12 officials have fully recovered while five are still under quarantine and self-isolation and one death was announced in April. Mothapo says Parliament is encouraged by what he describes as the resilience and the fighting spirit by its officials against the virus. He says the institution trusts and prays that the five officials currently still under quarantine and self-isolation will conquer the disease with the support of Parliament.
