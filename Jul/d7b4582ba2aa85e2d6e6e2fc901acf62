The Congress of the People (COPE) is calling on opposition parties, the religious and other sectors of society to unite in the fight against further looting of the COVID-19 relief fund. COPE says the scandal involving President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko, her husband King Madzikane Diko, Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and his wife Loyiso is just the tip of the iceberg. Gauteng ANC asks Bandile Masuku and Khusela Diko to step aside pending probe:  Diko’s husband’s company, Royal Bhaca Projects, was awarded an irregular tender for the supply of Personal Protective Equipment from Gauteng’s Health Department. COPE National Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says: “This COVID-19 PPE’s looting is happening in all the provinces. COPE is saying the solution to stop this corruption is for all opposition parties, civil society organisations, community-based organisations and faith-based organisations to come together to save our country from further destruction.” Meanwhile, several NGOs have expressed disappointment and anger over reports of widespread corruption involving funds meant to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in Gauteng. The organisations, including the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Corruption Watch, OUTA and Section 27 say it’s troubling that over 90 companies that received purchase orders from the Department of Health are under investigation. They also welcomed Premier David Makhura’s decision to place Health MEC Bandile Masuku on leave pending an investigation, over his alleged involvement in a R125-million Personal Protective Equipment contract. The NGOs have commended the Gauteng provincial government’s decision to give priority to a Special Investigating Unit investigation into PPE procurement processes. Makhura announced on Thursday that over 100 companies are under investigation over PPE contracts worth about one-billion rand.
