The Wines of South Africa organisation (WOSA) says the alcohol ban is costing the industry more than R300 million a week. WOSA spokesperson, Maryna Calow, says an estimated 18 000 jobs have been lost and up to 80 cellars were closed during the initial ban. She says the reintroduction of the ban on local sales will result in the closure of more wineries and, depending on the length of the ban, job losses in excess of 30 000. “For each week that the ban remains in place our industry loses another R300 million.  This number does not account for the roughly R100 million that is lost each week on wine tourism as well.  Add to this the estimated R3-billion that has already been lost at the beginning of the lockdown and this picture looks decidedly bleak for our farmers.” Addressing the media on Thursday on Level 3 COVID-19 Regulations for Tourism Sector, Minister Mmamoloko  Kubayi-Ngubane says the Cabinet has agreed to move the curfew to 22:00 from the current 21:00 in the evening. She says the 9pm curfew was having a crippling effect on the industry. Cabinet has also agreed to ease restrictions around leisure travel, which will allow citizens to leave their homes for leisure purposes within the provinces they live in. Interprovincial travel remains prohibited. Below is the Tourism regulations as presented by the Minister:
