Spokesperson to the President, Khusela Diko, has taken leave of absence and will temporarily relinquish her roles in government. This is according to a statement released by the presidency on Monday evening. “This is pending the outcome of investigations into the awarding of two subsequently cancelled contracts for the supply of Personal Protective Equipment to Royal Bhaca Projects; a company in which her husband is a director, ” the statement outlines. The company was allegedly awarded contracts worth R125 million.  The Presidency says Diko made the request for a leave of absence. She has thanked the Presidency for accepting her request. “I wish to thank the Presidency for timeously acceding to my request. It is of the utmost importance that the work of the Presidency and government as a whole is not undermined or adversely impacted by these allegations, especially at this time when our nation’s focus is on battling the COVID-19 pandemic.” Tyrone Seale has been appointed to act in Khusela’s position. Earlier, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema called for Diko’s removal, saying keeping Diko on the job dents the President’s fight against corruption.
