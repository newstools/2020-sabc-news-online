Tonight we’re checking in with power utility Eskom. Because load shedding may have been suspended, but there are parts of South Africa where residents remain in the dark amidst the cold weather and COVID-19 fears. A resident of Chiawelo in Soweto has told SABC News they have been without power for a month. In a bid to crackdown on thousands of illegal connections, Eskom has implemented daily cuts in certain areas at peak times in the morning and in the afternoons.
