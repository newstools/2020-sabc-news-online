The African National Congress (ANC) Top Six meeting scheduled for today has been postponed following the death of the wife of African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General, Paul Mashatile. This is the second tragedy to hit the family recently after Mashatile’s mother died in June. Mashatile is now in self-quarantine after a staff member at his office tested positive for COVID-19. ANC headquarters, the Luthuli House is now closed. This follows reports of a confirmed COVID-19 case, resulting in ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile, who lost his wife Manzi Ellen on Sunday, going into self-quarantine.  The ANC says it would not be fair to hold a leader’s meeting under these circumstances and it has been postponed. “We thought that we could give him the comfort he needs. Losing a parent is not easy, losing a partner is even a double blow now. He is now on self-quarantine because a staffer in his office has tested positive. He’s doing everything he can to obey the quarantine regulations,” says ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe. Mabe says the ANC will offer the necessary support to the Mashatile family during this time. “Where people want to convey messages of condolences, we’ll be working closely with the family as the African National Congress to set up our virtual platforms where such messages can be deposited.” Meanwhile, the ANC’s Top Six will meet again at a date that is still to be announced.
