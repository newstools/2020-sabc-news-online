Amnesty International South Africa is calling on South Africans to stop inaction and silence on Gender-Based Violence (GBV). The organisation says South Africa cannot allow increased surges of femicides to continue, only for silence to follow. “It must end now. The government must tackle GBV with the same zeal and coordinated effort as they demonstrated with COVID-19.” “It is time to smash the silence. Not just government silence but societal silence too. Each and every one of us must ring the bell on abuse, interrupt abusers and refuse to stand back and allow this shadow pandemic of violence to continue.” The organisation has also reiterated its call for government to increase its efforts in ensuring that the rights of women and girls are protected and upheld. It also wants​ violations of these rights documented and dealt with in a timely manner by the justice system. “It must also fulfil its promise to introduce and implement legislation on GBV without any further delays,” the organisation says. Amnesty International SA was responding to a debate in Parliament on gender-based violence (GBV), which was held on Tuesday and a subsequent protest outside the building. “Amnesty International South Africa agrees that additional debates and speeches on GBV are not changing anything. Only urgent, decisive and concrete action will bring the crucial change needed to stop South Africa’s war on women and girls,” says Amnesty International South Africa Executive Director, Shenilla Mohamed. The country has seen an increased number of reported cases of GBV since the start of level 3 lockdown in June. One of the shocking incidents was that of a pregnant Soweto woman who was found hanging from a tree. Her body had stab wounds.
