The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture resumed its hearings in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning, with the Group Executive of Legal Risk and Compliance Martha Ngonye. In March, Ngonye gave evidence to the commission on how forged signatures were used to secure various tenders at the state entity. On Tuesday, the commission completed testimony from Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) former board chairperson Popo Molefe. The former chairperson has for the past two days been giving jaw dropping evidence regarding corruption at the agency. He alleged that the administration under former president Jacob Zuma enabled rampant looting at Prasa. Molefe also said organs of state including those in the security cluster failed to act on reports on state capture at Prasa. “It was inexplicable … the way it was dealt with but certainly the minister of justice under whom and minister of police under whom these organs resort should have been able to say look, we see in the public domain and the reports given to minister of transport that there are these cases that have been lodged with you give us a status report these are very serious matters,” explains Molefe.
