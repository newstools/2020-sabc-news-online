Health experts have warned politicians at an advanced age to be cautious when executing their responsibilities as the country grapples to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Elderly people are most susceptible to contract the virus and South Africa has an ageing political leadership. Family Physician Fundile Nyati says most politicians in the country are at risk of contracting the virus. “Comparing us to other nations, you have got a lot of people who are younger than 50. But in South Africa, we have the majority of politicians who are much older. We have got data that we have received in the Western Cape that from age 50 and above that’s where most deaths are happening. “And so, if we then look at the average politicians in South Africa, they are 50 and above. And what that means is that a significant percentage of our politicians are at risk and it is not just the issue of age but it is also the issue of pre-morbid conditions or lifestyle illnesses that they may have,” Nyati warns. Mokgoro tests positive This comes after North West Premier, Professor Job Mokgoro tested positive for the coronavirus. Mokgoro tested for the virus yesterday following the passing of the MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, Gordon Kegakilwe of COVID-19 complications. Mokgoro’s spokesperson Vuyisile Ngesi says the Premier is now in self-isolation, after receiving results. Ngesi says the premier is, however, not incapacitated to carry out his duties. The support staff who have worked closely with the premier have been instructed to take the necessary precautions. Ngesi says the premier is currently showing one symptom of coronavirus, which is coughing. Meanwhile, the MEC for Public Works Saliva Molapisi who has tested positive for coronavirus is also in self-isolation.
