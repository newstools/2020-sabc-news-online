Lawyers for George Floyd, who died on May 25 after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, will file a civil lawsuit against the city and its police officers on Wednesday, according to a statement from his attorneys. Details of the lawsuit on behalf of Floydâ€™s family were not yet available. The move was announced on Tuesday in a press release. It said a news conference would be held Wednesday to detail the lawsuit by Floyd lawyers Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci. Three other officers who were at the scene have been charged with aiding and abetting in the case. His death, on the heels of several other high-profile police killings of African Americans, triggered protests across the United States and globally, with the Black Lives Matter group demanding a revamping of law enforcement. The US Congress failed last month to agree on legislation designed to bring about changes in policing.
