Earlier this year, citizens across South Africa held protests against gender-based violence following a spike of reported murder cases of women, occurring mostly at the hands of their male partners. A large number of domestic violence and femicide cases are left unreported. If you are a victim of gender-based violence or know someone who is, please contact the GBV Command Centre on 0800 428 428 Calls to the #GBV command centre have increased during lockdown, this means that more women are being helped. If you or someone you know needs help, contact the Gender-based Violence Command Centre on 0800428428 or *120*7867# #StopGBV @The_DSD @DWYPD_ZA pic.twitter.com/83fKeiWJMh — South African Government (@GovernmentZA) July 7, 2020  GBV cases on the increase during Level 3 lockdown
