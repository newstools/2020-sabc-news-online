Buffalo City Council Speaker Alfred Mtsi has been laid to rest in East London in the Eastern Cape. Mtsi succumbed to COVID-19 on Sunday last week. In this video below, Buffalo City Executive Mayor. Cllr Xola Pakathi gives more details around the passing of Mtsi: Mtsi has been described her father as a humble and loving man. Mayor Xola Phakathi described Mtsi as a noble activist and an honourable individual. “We should at least remind ourselves who he was, what politics and life and philosophy he lived by. This will assist us to better understand the values he espoused and what we should take from his life journey. “Nothing summarizes for me the political philosophy that guided comrade Mtsi’s activism than the statement he made in 1965 in a letter titled ‘Socialism and men in Cuba’ by Che Guevara. He had deep revolutionary convictions and loved his comrades. When provoked, he could be, however, very confrontational, but he did that respectfully and in a dignified manner.”
