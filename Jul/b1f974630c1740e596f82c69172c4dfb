KwaZulu-Natal has had one of its best sardine runs in years. Fishermen continue to catch plenty of the popular silvery fish along the coast. The annual sardine phenomenon sees the migration of sardines from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of KwaZulu-Natal during winter months. Crates of sardines are sold at R250 each, down from R1 000 at the start of the season. Seine netter, Goolam Essack, says there’s plenty of sardines still coming. “It’s not over yet, there’s plenty more coming; plenty sardines coming. They were big yesterday, Port Edward coming through Leisure Bay. Yesterday we netted at Warner Beach, Warners and Winkle.” Another Seine netter Gareth Leisegang says they’ve had a good sardine run. “Ya, it’s been a good run. We’ve had a good couple of nets all the way down from Ramsgate all the way up to Durban. Here so we’ve been following the fish up. Hopefully they stick around for a little bit longer and we can fish some more.“ In the video below, sardines galore in KZN:
