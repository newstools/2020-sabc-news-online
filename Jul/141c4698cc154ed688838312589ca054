The Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) is on Tuesday expected to file papers in a bid to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal to hear their appeal opposing government’s ban on the sale of tobacco products. The High Court in Pretoria dismissed FITA’s application for leave to appeal after it was found that the organisation had failed to demonstrate that its appeal had reasonable prospects of success. The sale of cigarettes in the country has been banned since the start of the lockdown in late March. Government cited health reasons amid the COVID-19 pandemic. FITA has argued before the high court that there was no evidence that the ban on the sale of tobacco products alleviates the burden on the health-care system. Government has since clarified that these sales are prohibited under the current level 3 regulations, and are subject to change.
