North West Premier Job Mokgoro says although he has tested positive for the coronavirus, he is still in good health. The 72-year old Mokgoro announced on Tuesday afternoon that he had tested positive for the virus. He says he tested on Monday, following the death of the province’s Cooperative Governance MEC Gordon Kegakilwe of COVID-19-related complications. Mokgoro is now in self-isolation and says he will be working remotely. “I’m kicking harder than an ox. I went to test, as a result of my colleague, our fallen hero, MEC Gordon Kegakilwe, and fortunately, the results came back very quickly, and they told me that I’m positive. They were actually saying I’m probably on the recovery side because I told them that I’ve just been feeling feverish over the past two weeks. No difficulties with coughing; no difficulties about breathing; no sneezing. I’m up and about and about. Obviously, given the results, I’m listening to my doctors, who will give me instructions from time to time.” In the video below, Premier Job Mokgoro says he feels highly energetic:  Earlier, Mokgoro’s Spokesperson Vuyisile Ngesi says the Premier is in self-isolation. He says the Premier is, however, not incapacitated to carry out his duties. The support staff who have worked closely with the Premier have been instructed to take the necessary precautions. Ngesi says the Premier is currently showing one symptom of coronavirus, which is coughing.  ‘Politicians at risk’ Meanwhile, health experts have warned politicians at an advanced age to be cautious when executing their responsibilities as the country grapples to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Elderly people are most susceptible to contract the virus and South Africa has an aging political leadership. Family Physician Fundile Nyati says most politicians in the country are at risk of contracting the virus.
