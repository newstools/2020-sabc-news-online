The panel will also propose measures to preserve the soundness of the banking sector, the memo said. Lebanese banks are poised for a major shake-out after the country plunged into a financial crisis last October that has ballooned prices, slashed jobs, and brought on capital controls that have frozen people out of their dollar savings. A government rescue plan that has served as the cornerstone of talks with the International Monetary Fund to help Lebanon out of its financial crisis maps out massive losses in thefinancial system. The talks with the IMF have been bogged down by a dispute between the government and the central bank over the scale of the losses and how they should be shared. Debt-saddled Lebanon has around 40 banks serving a population of around 6 million. The sector has swelled to four times the size of the economy thanks to decades of taking in billions of dollars every year from Lebanonâ€™s widely scattered diaspora to help fund the government. Audit of Lebanon’s central bank to include all its transactions – Economy minister The audit of Lebanon’s central bank accounts announced last month will include every transaction at the bank, Economy Minister Raoul Nehme said in an interview published on Sunday. Prime Minister Hassan Diab said last month that Lebanon will audit its central bank’s accounts in a bid to show transparency after launching debt restructuring talks with creditors. A forensic auditor “will look into all the transactions” for an understanding of activities at the central bank, the economy minister told the Financial Times newspaper. “Whatever bailouts and so on. Everything that was done”, he added. The forensic audit will be executed by an independent auditing firm, one of the three – KPMG, Kroll and Oliver Wyman -appointed in April, the minister told the newspaper without confirming which of those three will actually run it. A crippling financial crisis that has gripped Lebanon for months saw it default on its hefty foreign-currency debt for the first time and launch restructuring talks in late March. The economic implications of shutdowns related to the coronavirus outbreak have further compounded woes in a country with a weakening currency, dwindling reserves and soaring inflation. The prime minister’s cabinet has pledged to reshape the crisis-hit Lebanese banking sector and the audit comes as part of the sector’s restructuring.
