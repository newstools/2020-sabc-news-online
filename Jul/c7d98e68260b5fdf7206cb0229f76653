The UN Security Council on Wednesday finally backed UN chief Antonio Guterres’ March 23 call for a global truce amid the coronavirus pandemic, adopting a resolution after months of talks to win a compromise between the United States and China. The resolution, drafted by France and Tunisia, calls for”all parties to armed conflicts to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days” to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Negotiations on the resolution were stymied by a standoff between China and the United States over whether to urge support for the World Health Organisation. The United States did not want a reference to the global health body, while China did. US President Donald Trump said in May that Washington would quit the Geneva-based UN agency over its handling of the pandemic, accusing it of being “China-centric” and promoting China’s “disinformation,” assertions the WHO denies. Reaction to Trump’s decision to halt WHO funding  The adopted Security Council resolution does not mention the WHO but references a UN General Assembly resolution that does. “We have really seen the body at its worst,” Richard Gowan, International Crisis Group UN director, said of the council. “This is a dysfunctional Security Council.” The United States and China both took veiled swipes at each other after the resolution was adopted. The United States said in a statement that while it supported the resolution “it does not include crucial language to emphasize transparency and data-sharing as critical aspects in fighting this virus.” China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun acknowledged the body”should have responded immediately” to Guterres’ call, adding:”We were very frustrated that some country politicized this process.”
