There are renewed calls for harsher punishment for perpetrators of Gender-based Violence by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).  The party’s supporters protested at the Welkom Magistrate’s Court in the Free State demanding that her estranged boyfriend, Mpho Marumo accused of assaulting his girlfriend be denied bail. They came to support a woman who was doused in paraffin and set alight allegedly by her boyfriend. 27-year-old Wendy Mafale says she’s lucky to be alive. She says Marumo had arrived at a house where she was relaxing with friends. The two started arguing and her boyfriend allegedly doused her with paraffin from a heater. One of her friends also survived with burn wounds. Marumo has been slapped with an attempted murder charg,e but Mafale says she is still traumatised. “I don’t have words to say. It’s painful. I almost lost died. I almost lost my life for someone I used to love.” EFF demand tough action against the alleged perpetrator. Party members picketed outside court. Free State EFF Chairperson Mandisa Makesini says they were protesting so that accused would not get bail. “We are in support of Caroline who was burnt by a boyfriend who is cruel.” Resident Angelina Sithole concurs. “If we see there’s a woman who is being abused we are going to act.” Meanwhile, Marumo’s bail application has been postponed to the 13th of August. The matter will be transferred to the Regional Court.
