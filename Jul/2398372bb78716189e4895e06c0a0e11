The fraud case against a 27-year-old bank employee, who allegedly stole R25 million from the bank accounts of Limpopo provincial government departments, has been postponed to Thursday. Fhatuwani Mudzanani appeared before the Waterval Magistrate’s Court in Elim today. He was arrested by the Hawks a week ago. It is alleged that Mudzanani transferred money into various bank accounts that he had opened. Mudzanani’s bail application, which was set to proceed today, was postponed after his lawyer, Advocate Desmond Mphaphuli, made an application for a postponement. He told the court that he was only given instruction last night to take over the case by a colleague, who represented Mudzanani. Mphaphuli said he needed more time to properly consult with Mudzanani before proceeding with a bail application. Prosecutor Ntendeleni Tshinyani did not object to the request of the defense. Senior Magistrate, Avhurengwi Munyai granted the application for postponement. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, says Mudzanani’s first lawyer fell ill. “The matter of Sidwell Mudzanani has been postponed to Thursday the 30th in Waterval court due to the fact that the attorney was not feeling well, that’s why the matter is being postponed for the appearance again for bail application.” Mudzanani is from Mashau village in Elim outside Louis Trichardt. He allegedly stole millions of rand from government and transferred the money into his bank accounts. Four bank cards and about R2 000 in cash were seized from his house during his arrest.  The Hawks say they had been investigating the case for about a month. Mudzanani remains in custody.
