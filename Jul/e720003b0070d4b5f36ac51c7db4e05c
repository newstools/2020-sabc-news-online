Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema says the party has become an unstoppable force of change in the country seven years after its establishment. He says the EFF stands on the shoulders of Winnie Mandela, Zindzi Mandela, Robert Sobukwe, Julius Nyerere, Robert Mugabe, Peter Mokaba and Nomvo Booi. Addressing a virtual rally to mark the party’s seventh anniversary, Malema said they would continue to fight for seven non-negotiable pillars on which a new South Africa and the continent as a whole must be forged. “…Expropriation of South Africa’s land without compensation, nationalisation of mines, banks and other strategic sectors of the economy, build a state and government capacity which will lead to the abolishment of tenders, free quality education, healthcare, houses and sanitation, massive protected industrial development to create millions sustainable jobs minimum wages in order to close the gap between the rich and the poor. Massive developments of the African economy, open accountable corrupt-free government and society without fear or victimisation by state agencies.” Malema says democracy and political power in the hands of the ANC is meaningless as it does not come with economic freedom. “It has become the desk of white monopoly capital that appoints different managers every five years to manage the affairs of the rich at the expense of the poor. The former liberation movement no longer has any coherent programme of action to change the conditions of our people. Political power in the control of the post-1994 government is meaningless as it has not come with economic freedoms. The post-1994 government has played an active role in reproducing the inequality and imbalances of the past,” adds Malema. Below is Malema’s virtual address:
