The bail application of the 43 men linked to the attack on the International Pentecost Holiness Church in Zuurbekom, will continue on Tuesday in the West Rand Magistrate’s Court in Gauteng. The suspects are charged with murder, attempted murder, and malicious damage to property. Five people were killed during a church hostage drama last month. Among the 43 suspects are a police officer, a soldier, and a lawyer. The attacks are over an on-going leadership feud, which began in 2016. The church is now split into three factions – each with a successor. This is IPHC STATEMENT.
