The Gauteng Health Department says it is waiting for the City of Tshwane to sign a Memorandum of Understanding which will enable it to turn the Tshwane Events Centre, formerly known as the Tshwane Show Grounds, into a COVID-19 field hospital. The City took control of the facility after a protracted legal battle with the Tshwane Business and Agricultural Chamber (TSHWABAC) who rented it. The City says the current administrators will not lease the property to any church. Prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering Church was located at the facility for years. The department’s spokesperson, Kwara Kekana says,  “A Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Health and the City of Tshwane with regards to the Tshwane Events Centre becoming a field hospital is still with the city. But there is a principle agreement to use the space. The Tshwane Events Centre is estimated to take about a thousand oxygen beds, with the capacity to extend to 1 500 in that space. This will help to de-congest Covid-19 patients from some of our hospitals, particularly the Academic Hosptial Steve Biko and Dr. George Mukhari Hospital.” Gauteng records 209 new COVID-19 related deaths as SA registers 12 204 new cases Gauteng has recorded 209 new COVID-19 related deaths out 312 the country has registered in the last 24 hours.
