Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi has gone into precautionary quarantine again after one of his close aids tested positive for the coronavirus. Other staff members will also follow the precautionary protocols to monitor if they show any symptoms within the 14-day period. It’s the fourth time that President Masisi is going into quarantine since the coronavirus was detected in the SADC region. His country has been observing strict travel regulations and placed the Head of State in quarantine after attending the inauguration of Namibian President Hage Geingob on March 21st. The following month, he was exposed to a nurse who tested positive for the viral infection. In May, Masisi travelled to Zimbabwe for a SADC meeting and on his return to Gaborone, he again entered quarantine. His office is now working on contact tracing to ensure all those exposed follow measures.
