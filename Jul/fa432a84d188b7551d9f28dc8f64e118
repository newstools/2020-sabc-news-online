Almost one million public-sector workers in Britain are to be given above-inflation pay rises, the government said on Tuesday, to reflect their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Britain has been the European country worst hit by the virus, with an official death toll of more 45 000. The crisis has shown that many of the people critical to the countryâ€™s functioning are among the lowest paid. Teachers will receive the largest overall increase at 3.1%, while doctors and dentists will be given rises of 2.8%. The police will get a 2.5% increase and members of the armed forces will receive 2%, the government said. More than a million nurses and hospital staff have previously agreed a separate pay settlement, which works out at 4.4% this year. Wage growth in Britain was slowing before COVID-19, falling to an annual rate of 2.8% in the three months to end-February, before the crisis caused average total pay to drop -0.3% in March-June, the first negative figure since 2014. Inflation fell to a four-year low of 0.5% in May, before rising slightly to 0.6% in June. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been criticised for his response to the crisis, with opposition parties and some scientists saying the government was too slow to lock down, too slow to do widespread testing and not clear in its messaging. Johnson, who won a large majority last year, hopes to revive his fortunes by returning to his pledge to focus spending on traditional Labour-supporting areas that backed his Conservatives. Public sector pay was frozen for all but the lowest earners in 2010 and increases were limited to 1% a year from 2013 to 2018 to reduce the budget deficit.
