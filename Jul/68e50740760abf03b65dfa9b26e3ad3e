The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Friday morning hear testimony from the former Director-General of the State Security Agency (SSA), Jeff Maqetuka. Last year, the inquiry heard testimony that the SSA had initiated a probe into the Gupta family when it was revealed that the then Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, knew about his inclusion in the Cabinet in 2009, allegedly from one of the members of the Gupta family. The probe was subsequently halted by then State Security Minister, Siyabonga Cwele. The proceedings will start at 10am at the City of Johannesburg Old Council Chambers. Guptas used their relationship with Zuma Last year, the Commission heard how the Guptas used their relationship with former President Jacob Zuma to bully their way into businesses. The former Director of the Domestic Branch of State Security Agency, Gibson Njenje, told the commission that he was brought in to mediate at a meeting where Ajay Gupta demanded a 90% stake in a company linked to former President Kgalema Motlanthe‘s wife, Gugu Mtshali. Njenje, together with Mo Shaik and Maqethuka worked at the intelligence agency from 2009 to 2011 when they were forced to resign due to the breakdown of relationship with then State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele. Gibson Njenje told the commission how he was called by his long-time friend, Archie Luhlabo, requesting to come to Motlanthe’s home in Sandton. He said he found Luhlabo there with Mtshali – both were directors of a mining company called Imperial Crown Trading (ICT). In the video below, Njenje testifies before the commission:
