Gauteng Health MEC Dr. Bandile Masuku has denied involvement in alleged COVID-19 personal protective equipment (PPEs) tender irregularities. It is alleged that the MEC influenced the processes involving the procurement of PPEs. However, Masuku has refuted the allegations as unfounded saying the awarding of contracts within the department rests with the Supply Chain Management in the Finance department. In a statement, Masuku says he requested a forensic audit into COVID-19 procurement last week. He says Gauteng Premier David Makhura subsequently asked the Special Investigative Unit to investigate undertake this investigation which began in May. Masuku says, if evidence of corruption is found at his department action will be taken and offenders prosecuted. The MEC has also refuted any suggestion that COVID-19 procurement is being used as a means to raise funds ahead of African National Congress (ANC) conferences.
