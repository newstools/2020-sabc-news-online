The African National Congress (ANC) has described South Africa’s Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela, as an important figure in the fight for the country’s democracy. The 59-year-old daughter of former President Nelson Mandela, and struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, passed away at a Johannesburg hospital in the early hours of Monday morning. ANC Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says Zindzi will always be remembered for her speech to a mass gathering in Soweto in 1985 – where she read a letter written by her father – refusing an offer by then President P.W. Botha to release him. “Zindzi played a critical role in the old struggle days. You would remember her for the infamous letter that came from Mandela at the time, giving directives to the people of the ANC on what tasks had to be discharged. So she was a very important part of the ANC in many other ways. She has made sacrifices.” In the video below Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane reads her father’s letter:  The Minister of International and Cooperation, Dr. Naledi Pandor has expressed deep condolences to the Mandela family, friends, and colleagues. Minister Pandor says, “Zindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of our struggle heroes, Tata Nelson, and Mama Winnie Mandela but as a struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well.” In the video below Zindzi shares her experiences with her mom Winnie Madikizela-Mandela
