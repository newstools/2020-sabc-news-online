The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called for the country to return to Level 5 lockdown for the next three months. The party contends that the public and private healthcare systems will not be able to cater to the rising numbers of infections. EFF has warned that failure to do so will result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. South Africa has registered its highest number of infections to date within a 24-hour cycle. The number of confirmed cases has risen by 8 124 bringing the national total to 159 333. The number of COVID19-related fatalities now stands at 2 749 with the Western Cape, Gauteng and the Eastern Cape being the epicentres of the pandemic. “In order to sustain the Level-5 lockdown the government must ensure that food parcels are regulated, the government must ensure that there are enough supplies of food, water, sanitation and electricity for all and all financial institutions they must be forced to give people an interest-free payment holiday of three months.  People cannot die because they have loan obligations to pay for their homes. We cannot lose lives because people have to go out there to fend for themselves,” says EFF’s national spokesperson Delisile Ngwenya.
