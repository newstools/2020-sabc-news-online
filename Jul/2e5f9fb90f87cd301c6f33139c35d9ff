The Mandela family have confirmed that the daughter of former President Nelson Mandela and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Zindzi, will be laid to rest on Friday. The family also revealed that Zindzi tested positive for COVID-19 but could not confirm if this was the cause of her death. The 59-year-old Zindzi Mandela passed away on Monday. At the time of her passing, she was the South African Ambassador to Denmark. Coming from a family of struggle heroes, Zindzi was active in the country’s fight for freedom from apartheid. The African National Congress (ANC) has described Zindzi Mandela as an important figure in the fight for the country’s democracy. ANC Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says Zindzi will always be remembered for her speech to a mass gathering in Soweto in 1985 – where she read a letter written by her father – refusing an offer by then President P.W. Botha to release him. “Zindzi played a critical role in the old struggle days. You would remember her for the infamous letter that came from Mandela at the time, giving directives to the people of the ANC on what tasks had to be discharged. So she was a very important part of the ANC in many other ways. She has made sacrifices.” In the video below Zindzi Mandela reads her father’s letter:
