Police have arrested two suspects in connection with the armed robbery of a family at Nkivane, in Nsuze, northern KwaZulu-Natal. It is believed that the suspects forced their way into the house, attacking a father and his daughter and tying them up with an extension cord. They allegedly demanded money and cellphones. Provincial Police Spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the suspects were nabbed during a police operation on the R102 near Ballito. “The Umhlali Task Team was busy conducting an operation on the R102 near Ballito when the stolen vehicle was spotted. The said vehicle was intercepted and it was found to have had two occupants. Both occupants were questioned about the vehicle but they didn’t explain to the satisfaction of the police members. Then they were placed under arrest. Two suspects aged 22 and 30 are expected to appear before the Umhlali Magistrate’s Court facing the charges of possession of stolen property and house robbery,” says Mbhele.
