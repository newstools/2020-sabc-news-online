Egypt reported 703 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the Health Ministry said, the lowest figure since late May. In total, 86 474 COVID-19 cases have been reported and 4 188 deaths, including 68 on Friday, the Ministry said in a statement. Egypt reopened resorts to foreign tourists on July 1 after tourism came to a halt in March under measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak. But Egypt has not made it yet to a “safe list” of countries for resumption of non-essential travel to the European Union, which is reviewed every two weeks. Tourism accounts for 5% of Egypt’s economic output, according to the government. Analysts put the figure as much as 15% if jobs indirectly related to the sector are included.
