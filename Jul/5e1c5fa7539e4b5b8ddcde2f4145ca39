The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape says government’s promise to bring relief for freelance tour guides, has not materialised as yet. DA Tourism Spokesperson in the Western Cape legislature, Deidre Baartman, says it has been a month since Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane announced a R1 500 per month relief fund for freelance tour guides but to date, no payments have been made. She says the fund is for freelance tour guides who are registered with their relevant provincial authorities and the money would offer much-needed relief for three months. Baartman says over R3 billion has been lost by the tourism industry since the start of lockdown, with at least 20% of tourism businesses set to close by the end of the year. “The Western Cape Registrar has successfully completed all necessary information and updating of the registered tour guide database for the province. It has been submitted to the national Department of Tourism, but no pay-outs have taken place. There are over 12 000 registered freelance tour guides in the Western Cape alone,” says Baartman.
