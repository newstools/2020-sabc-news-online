Former Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and Minerals Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe are among those expected to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg this week. The commission will resume hearings on Monday. Last year former BOSASA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Angelo Agrizzi told the commission that some ministers and employees of state-owned enterprises were in the company’s pockets. Mokonyane is alleged to have received some money from BOSASA, including upgrades to her house, in exchange for government contracts. Pretoria Chief Magistrate Desmond Nair and Judge Tintswalo Makhubela are also expected to give evidence this week. Former President Jacob Zuma appointed Judge Tintswalo Makhubele when she was the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) interim board chair. This according to evidence given this month by Senior Advocate Francois Botes who worked on the Prasa and Siyaya litigation process. Botes alleges that the judge was appointed by Zuma to sort out the mess at the state-owned entity. Makhubele was appointed as a judge with effect from 1 January 2018, and was also appointed as Prasa board chair during the same time. Makhubele later laid a complaint against Botes. She is expected to come to the commission and explain her role in the Prasa litigation matter. Last week, former Transnet boss Mafika Mkwanazi said he visited the Gupta residents twice at Saxonworld in 2011. The former executive says the Guptas indicated they wanted to lay their hands on Transnet’s marketing budget and wanted to be allocated between 30 and 50%  of that project. Mkwanazi said he met Tony Gupta and Duduzane Zuma. He said the Guptas made him aware they were close friends of the then-president Jacob Zuma. Commission will resume on Monday 20 July 2020 at 10:00 as follows:#StateCaptureInquiry pic.twitter.com/AlUQuZOzPq — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) July 17, 2020
