Egypt reported 969 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the Health Ministry said, the first drop below 1 000 registered daily since May 27. In total 76 222 COVID-19 cases have been reported and 3 422 deaths, including 79 on Monday, the Ministry said in a statement. Egypt reopened resorts to foreign tourists last week after tourism came to a halt in March under measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak. But Egypt was not on an initial “safelist” of 14 countries for resumption of non-essential travel to the European Union, announced last week. Tourism accounts for 5% of Egypt’s economic output, according to the government. But analysts put the figure as much as 15% if jobs indirectly related to the sector are included.
