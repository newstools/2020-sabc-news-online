KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the African National Congress (ANC) will continue to fight corruption at a provincial and government level. Officials from Zikalala’s office appeared in court on charges of fraud and corruption amounting to R24 million. Responding to questions from the media in Durban during a virtual briefing, he says “It is the ANC that is fighting corruption. Yes, it is unfortunate that people view this as happening under the ANC government, but it is important that if you want to politicize it, look across and all spheres and all areas where parties are governing. Corruption is a system that is dangerous. If you would want to politicise it ask yourself about the investigation done by Cogta, about Zululand. So, corruption should be tackled as corruption.”
