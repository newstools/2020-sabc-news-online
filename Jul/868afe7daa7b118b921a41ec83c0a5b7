The Nelson Mandela Foundation has issued a statement expressing its sadness on Zindziswa Mandela’s passing. The organisation says they are shocked to wake to the news of the untimely passing of Zindziswa Mandela. “On a day when we are marking the anniversary of another terrible moment, when Madiba’s son Thembekile died in a car accident in 1969. Zindzi was someone we had come to know well and to love. She was our friend. Our thoughts are with her family and friends.” Nelson Mandela Foundation says Zindzi will be remembered for a rich and extraordinary life, marked by many iconic moments. In the video below, Chairperson of Parliament Portfolio Committee on International Relations Tandi Mahambehlala reacts to the passing of Zindzi:  The organisation says they remember the years she spent banished with Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to the small town of Brandfort. Zindzi, who served as South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark, was the younger of the Mandela daughters – and regarded by many as a child of the nation. “That summer’s day in February 1985 at Jabulani Stadium when she read to the world Madiba’s rejection of President Botha’s offer of a conditional release from prison.” Her own courageous work in underground structures. Public service as South African Ambassador to Denmark. Zindziswa Mandela will be remembered as a special soul. She worked with the Foundation on many projects over the years. The Nelson Mandela Foundation says they valued her generosity, her warmth and her sense of humour. “She was always patient in responding to our requests for information and other forms of assistance. And we admired her strength in dealing with life’s challenges and tragedies.” In the video below, Zindzi reads her father’s letter:   She accompanied her mother into banishment at Brandfort and visited her father on Robben Island from the age of 16.
