The offices of the City of Joburg’s Environment and Infrastructure Service have been closed due to a COVID-19 case. It says one of its employees has tested positive to the virus and has since succumbed to the pandemic. The offices will be reopened next week Thursday. “One of our employees was declared positive. Upon admission at hospital in Boksburg he passed on. Because of that we then opted to close the offices from yesterday until Thursday. We are busy sanitising the office. We have directed all staff in the building to self quarantine and then we have then asked the health people to start doing screening and testing of the staff,” says Stan Itshegetseng, Deputy Director of the Environment and Infrastructure. Dear residents: we urge you all to keep safe, and take every safety precaution possible to ensure your own safety and others, the road is still long ahead #COVIDー19 #JoburgCares ^NS pic.twitter.com/giJzzlSWDa — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) July 3, 2020  In this video, measures to deal with COVID-19 in Gauteng are discussed
