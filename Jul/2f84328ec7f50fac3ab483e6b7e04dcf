The Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature is mourning the passing of former member and African National Congress (ANC) stalwart Mlungisi Ndamase. Ndamase served two terms as a Member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature. Premier Oscar Mabuyane has sent his condolences to the Ndamase family. He says he will request President Cyril Ramaphosa to approve a Special Provincial Funeral for Ndamase, who was also a member of Umkhonto weSizwe during the liberation struggle. State funerals are afforded to citizens deemed to have made an impactful contribution in their field. The Deputy Speaker of the Provincial Legislature Mlibo Qoboshiyane says Ndamase played an important role in rebuilding the nation. “Mr Ndamase served as an ANC MPL in the First Term (1994-1999) and in the Fifth Term (2014-2019). Mr Ndamase was known as a soft-spoken, modest and humble public representative. He will be remembered for his outstanding contribution in the reconstruction and building of the Eastern Cape Province following the dismantle and defeat of the apartheid regime,” says Qoboshiyane. Ndamase’s cause of death has not yet been disclosed. Main types of state funded funerals in South Africa by SABC Digital News
