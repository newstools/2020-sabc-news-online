The National Assembly Programme Committee has agreed that Health Minister Zweli Mkhize should make a statement on the coronavirus situation in the country during a hybrid National Assembly Sitting on Wednesday next week. It has also emerged in the Programme Committee that the City of Cape Town will be called to appear before the Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Committee to answer questions about the dehumanisation of a man in Khayelitsha. Mkhize’s ministerial statement next week comes as various provinces like the Eastern Cape and Gauteng have seen a rapid rise in the number of daily coronavirus infections in the last week. ANC Chief Whip and member of the Programme Committee Pemmy Majodina says, “Let me welcome this presentation of the programme and agree that on the 8th we allow Minister Mkhize to come and do the executive statement because, at this time of the Peak of COVID 19,  it’s very much important to be put afloat on these issues. I fully second that, further seconding that the Deputy President (David Mabuza) answers questions on the 30th of July so that we don’t have any backlog. We appreciate that proactiveness of the Deputy President for giving us this date.”
