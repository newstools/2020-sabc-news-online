The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Thursday hear evidence relating to allegations of corruption and political interference at the National Prosecutions Authority (NPA) and the Hawks. Witnesses Terence Joubert, Colonel Welcome Mhlongo and Captain Edward Zuma will give evidence related to the tenure of former National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Mxolisi Nxasana. Testimony will revolve around claims by Nxasana to the Commission that former acting NDPP Nomgcobo Jiba sought to use Joubert and Mhlongo to get rid of him soon after his appointment as NPA head in 2013. In 2019, President Cyril Ramaphosa fired Jiba after a report by retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro established that they were unfit to hold office in the NPA. The report details that she had compromised integrity, lack of leadership skills and has poor ethical standards. Mhlongo was allegedly tasked to get dirt on Nxasana while it is claimed Joubert disclosed the plot. Meanwhile, Edward Zuma is expected to respond to claims made by former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss, Johan Booysen, that he sought to have him unfreeze millions of seized funds belonging to businessman Thoshan Panday, who he said was Zuma’s business partner. Commission will hear Law Enforcement related testimony from Mr Terence Joubert ,Col Welcome S Mhlongo, and Captain Edward Zuma on Thursday 30 July 2020 at 10:00.#StateCaptureInquiry pic.twitter.com/kViXbHG8g1 — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) July 29, 2020  In the video below, President Cyril Ramaphosa amends regulations of the Commission:
