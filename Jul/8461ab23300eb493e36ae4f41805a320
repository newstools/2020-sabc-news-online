Five people with suspected links to the New Years’ Day attacks in Melville and Newtown in Johannesburg are expected to appear in court on Monday. Two people died, while six others were seriously wounded after gunmen opened fire during a drive-by shooting in Melville in the early hours of New Year’s Day. Hours later, 11 people sustained gunshot wounds at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in the Johannesburg CBD after a person fired into the crowd from the M2 bridge. In the video below, prayer service held for victims of Melville shooting:  The five suspects were arrested in Kliprivier south of Johannesburg yesterday while police were following up on a kidnapping case of an elderly man. National Police Commissioner Kehla Sitole says they’ve discovered that some of the firearms recovered yesterday were identified in videos of the New Year’s Day shootings. “No further details on the rescue can be provided at this stage in order to protect the investigation. The victim stated that he was not physically harmed but as a precautionary measure he was taken to hospital for a thorough medical examination,” says National Police Spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo. “In the meantime, of the five suspects who were arrested yesterday, three men are to be charged with kidnapping and they will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday, 27 July 2020. The remaining two, a man and a woman will be charged for being in possession of firearms unlawfully and they will appear in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court also on Monday,” he adds.
