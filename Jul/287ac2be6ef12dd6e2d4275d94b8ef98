Economists say the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points will only bring slight relief to indebted consumers. Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago cited muted upside risks to the bank’s inflation outlook as the reason for the cut. The cut is in line with market expectations. The bank has further lowered its growth forecast.

Some said the Monetary Policy Committee was likely cut the repo rate on the back of materialising downside risks to both its inflation and growth forecasts, while others suggested that rates may remain unchanged as the bank is assessing the impact of the earlier rate cuts. In April, the MPC cut the repo rate by 100 basis points and cut the repo rate by 50 basis points in May.
