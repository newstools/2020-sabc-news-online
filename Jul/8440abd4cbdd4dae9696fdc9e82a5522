The George Airport in the Southern Cape has been opened for business travellers and cargo under alert Level 3. Western Cape MEC of Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier, says they welcome Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula’s announcement. He says they have been working hard, together with the Airports Company of South Africa (Acsa), the George Airport management, George Municipality and the provincial Department of Health to find a solution that will allow the George Airport to meet the criteria required for it to open. “The Western Cape Department of Health will now partner with Acsa to ensure that COVID-19 screening is conducted at the George Airport. The importance of opening the George Airport for the economy of the Garden Route district cannot be understated. Businesses in George and the Greater Knysna region are heavily dependent on business travellers having access to the George airport.” The video below, is the Economic Cluster’s briefing on COVID-19:  Bram Fischer, Port Elizabeth, Upington, and the Kruger Mpumalanga International Airports, Richards Bay and Pietermaritzburg airports are also among those that have reopened.
