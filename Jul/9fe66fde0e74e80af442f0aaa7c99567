The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) has condemned African National Congress (ANC) MP Boy Mamabolo for allegedly threatening journalist Ngwako Malatji. Mamabolo allegedly threatened to shoot Malatji who is a reporter with the Sunday World over the weekend for investigating allegations that the MP had made unsavoury remarks about President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to ban the sale of alcohol for the second time. Malatji provided evidence from a source in the form of cellphone screengrabs of a WhatsApp conversations in which Mamabolo allegedly threatened them with violence. Malatji has since opened a case of intimidation against the politician at the Mondeor Police Station in Johannesburg. Sanef Executive Director Kate Skinner says they want the ANC to take the necessary disciplinary action against Mamabolo. Skinner says, “We hope that SAPS will take this threat against the journalist seriously and carry out the necessary investigation. We hope that the MP responsible for the threats will be brought to justice to show that this unparliamentary behaviour has no place in our democracy. We also call on the ANC to show that it does not tolerate such behaviour within its ranks and that it will duly take steps to discipline its member.” SANEF – threats have no place in a democratic society & underline the risks that journalists face when covering the activities of politicians at all levels. https://t.co/9W5I5dhpzQ — SANEF (@SAEditorsForum) July 29, 2020
