The United States recorded more than 1 000 deaths from COVID-19 for the third day in a row on Thursday, as the outbreak strained hospitals in California, Florida and Texas, according to a Reuters tally. The rise in the US death toll has not seen back-to-back days with over 1,000 lives lost since early June. Many states and local governments in May lifted restrictions and reopened beaches, restaurants and businesses, triggering a surge in cases in June and an increase in fatalities in July. So far in July, 17 states have broken one-day records for increases in COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. With not all states reporting yet, deaths rose by at least 1 014 to a total of 144 211 on Thursday compared with a rise of 1 135 on Wednesday and a jump of 1 141 on Tuesday. Total cases across the United States surpassed 4 million and rose by at least 60 000 on Thursday. Even though deaths are rising in the United States for a second week in a row, they remain well below levels seen in April, when 2 000 people a day on average died from the virus. Among the 20 countries with the largest outbreaks, the United States ranks sixth highest globally for deaths per capita, according to a Reuters analysis.
