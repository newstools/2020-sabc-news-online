Severe floods triggered by monsoon rains have killed nearly 100 people in India’s Assam state, struggling already with the coronavirus pandemic. A famous national park was also underwater, threatening the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinoceros and other rare wildlife. At least 2.6 million others were displaced by the floods which have submerged at least 2 300 villages and 25 million acres of farmland. Environmentalist scientist C.K. Varshney called it a man-made disaster. Several overflowing rivers threatened cities in the state of 30 million people and urban planner K.T. Ravinder said they could soon destroy hospitals, power supply and communication. Director of Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi, Sunita Narain said the government will have to think out of the box to avoid this annual misery. The floods also killed scores of animals in Kaziranga National Park, including nine of the 2 400 rare one-horned rhinos in their protected habitat. Author- Rana Sen
