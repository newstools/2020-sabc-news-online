Calls for schools to close down to curb the spread of the coronavirus are increasing countrywide. Parents and the Free State’s Congress of South African Students (COSAS) have thrown their weight behind the proposal by the South African Teachers’ Union (SADTU) for schools to close amidst increasing number of infections across the country. More than 40 schools across the Free State have had learners and teachers infected with the novel coronavirus. Some schools have had to close down for decontamination more than once. Free State COSAS Secretary, Tsietsi Mbolekwa, says they will make sure no school operates while the coronavirus infections are expected to surge. “We are clear as COSAS and we are going to shut down all schools in the Free State. If there are any schools that are operating, we are going to make sure that we attend that school and shut it down. We are representing learners. We are representing our own constituency. We care for their lives. So, we are very clear as Congress of South African Students, ‘learners, you must not go back to school.'” In the video below, Mbolwekwa explains the organisation’s stance:  Parents are equally concerned. “Really, I don’t see any necessity of children going to school because it’s like now it is winter time and they said by winter corona cases will increase. So, it’s highly impossible that small children can go to school,” says one of the parents. The Basic Education Department insists that schools will remain open until further notice. This is as Education Minister Angie Motshekga engages with stakeholders in the sector.
