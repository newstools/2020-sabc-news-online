The fraud case against Enlightened Christian Gathering Church leader, Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, and his wife, Mary, is expected to start in the High Court in Pretoria on Monday. The couple faces charges of fraud, money laundering, and contravening the provision of organized crimes act for offenses they allegedly committed from 2015. The couple heads the international church with thousands of followers. Bushiri and his wife are both on bail of R100 thousand each. One of the charges relates to a contravention of exchange control regulations to the tune of about R15 million at the time. Their previous court appearances at the Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria were characterized by many of his supporters blocking the road in front of the court to show their solidarity and support to the man they also call “Major 1”.
