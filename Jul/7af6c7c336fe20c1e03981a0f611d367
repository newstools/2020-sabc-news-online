Africa’s diplomatic capital, Addis Ababa, has been remembering anti-apartheid activist, Andrew Mlangeni, who died at the age of 95. Mlangeni lived in Ethiopia in 1961, where he received military training. Andrew Mlangeni received military training in Ethiopia alongside the late President Nelson Mandela in the 1960s.

While they were incarcerated in 1963, Emperor Haile Selassie and other African leaders formed the Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa. The organisation campaigned for the independence of South Africa and other African countries. African harbours were closed to the South African government, and South African aircrafts were prohibited from flying over the rest of the continent.
