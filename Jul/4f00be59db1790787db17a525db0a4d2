When he retired from Eskom in 1994, he became Chairperson of the National Electricity Regulator, Chairman of the Southern African Development through Electricity, and Honorary Vice-President of the South African National Energy Association. Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter says: “It saddens me to have to announce the death of Dr McRae. He worked his way to become the first CEO of NERSA, CEO and first Eskom chair durn the time which he made a tremendous impact on the South African energy industry.” Eskom Group Chief Executive speaks on the passing of @Eskom_SA first Chief Executive Officer, Dr Ian McRae.
