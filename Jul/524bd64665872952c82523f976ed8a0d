Long distance taxi operators in the Free State affiliated to the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco0) say they are still frustrated by government’s decision not to allow them to operate at 100 percent capacity. During his address to the nation on Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa gave the go ahead for operators making short trips to operate at 100 percent capacity while long distance operations are limited to 70 percent capacity. Free Santaco secretary Mohlabane Phomudi says they are disappointed by the decision. “It should not be that a sugar quoted hypocrisy of saying triple BEE … it’s not happening because we can realise that a white minority is getting preference.

So we are saying to our government don’t disappoint us.” The video below is President Cyril Ramaphosa full address to the nation:
