The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has recalled the Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality Chief Whip Councillor, Lindelwa Penisi. The move comes after the circulation of a video recording, wherein she is seen exchanging vulgar verbal insults with members of the public. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this un-ANC behavior and will never be tolerated. Disciplinary processes will be instituted against Councillor Penisi,” the party says in a statement. “Such abhorrent behaviour makes a complete mockery of the office she holds and is contemptuous to the people of Raymond Mhlaba Municipality and the constituency she represents. We will at all times defend our people’s hard-won democracy and protect it against those who are clearly working relentlessly to undermine it.”
