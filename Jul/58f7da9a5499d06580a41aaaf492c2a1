The Hawks have confirmed that a former government minister’s wife has been arrested for alleged assault and malicious damage to property. The arrest took place Friday afternoon and the wife is currently detained at a police station in Pretoria. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the name of the Minister’s wife cannot be revealed at this stage. He says she is expected to appear in court on Monday. “The complaint has been with us for some time we are still busy working on those allegations. There were matters that transpired this week which necessitated us to go straight to the Magistrates Court to ask for a warrant of arrest based on the severity of the case and the charges that were laid. She’s going to appear in court on Monday in Hatfield.”
