Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has made an “urgent appeal” to South Africans to take the coronavirus seriously as the number of infections continue to rise in the country. The Ministry has announced 13 285 fresh COVID-19 infections, pushing the number of cases to 350 879. The Health Department has also confirmed 144 new fatalities – which has taken the death toll to 4 948. This is an urgent and important plea to all South Africans. The fight against #COVID19 is in our hands. We must act now. pic.twitter.com/dyqx0QBzIo — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) July 18, 2020  Mkhize says this is concerning. He says government has done all it could to contain the spread, but can’t win the battle alone. “We are extremely concerned that fatigue seems to have set in and South Africans are letting down their guard at a time when the spread of infection is is surging. We see poor or no social distancing in communities. Masks are being abandoned or not worn properly and there is laxity setting in around the frequent hand-washing,” he says. The Minister warns that this will have a direct influence in the rise in COVID-19 infections in the next two weeks. He is appealing to South Africans to admonish those who refuse to adhere to the regulations in place aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. #COVID19 Statistics in SA as at 18 July. pic.twitter.com/ynvw1oxUNN — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) July 18, 2020  More than 180 000 South Africans have beaten the virus and more than 2 million tests have been conducted so far.
