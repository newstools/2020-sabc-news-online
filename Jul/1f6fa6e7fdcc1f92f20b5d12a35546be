The World Health Organisation African Region (WHO Africa) says Rwanda is using drones in community awareness regarding COVID-19. Rwanda has 1 539 cases of coronavirus, five people are reported to have died and 819 recovered to date. In a statement WHO Africa says, “During the first phase of lockdown that started on 21 March in Rwanda, the Government of Rwanda observed that some of the densely populated neighbourhoods and high-risk zones were not respecting very well COVID-19 preventive measures as it was difficult to reach them by prevention awareness messages.” The agency says the lack of compliance by residents to directives to stay home, wash hands and respect physical distancing, wearing masks was due to the low accessibility of the areas by community awareness teams and their messages. The Rwanda National Police intervened with drones that were deployed to compliment radio and TV messages, community health workers and other community leaders by bringing educative messages directly to residents by air. Below is the full statement: Airports reopen Rwandan airports will reopen for all flights on August 12, 2020. Passengers will be required to show proof of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) taken within 72 hours of arrival. Passengers entering Rwanda will also be required to take a second mandatory test within 24 hours and other prevention measures will be put in place.
