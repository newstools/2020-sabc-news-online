Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says he is feeling much better after testing positive for the coronavirus almost two weeks ago. He has been recovering in isolation at home. Winde, who is a Type 2 diabetic, says he decided to get tested after he experienced flu-like symptoms. He was speaking during an online question and answer session. “This virus is something that you don’t want to get. If you can, social distance, wear your mask, wash your hands. Please do so, because it’s really not a nice virus to get. And of course, I didn’t get it in a way that I had to be hospitalised. I got it in a way that I still could manage and get through the virus at home. But I’m feeling much better now. I’ve still got a cough, and I’ll try and stay at home as long as possible without going out.” As of 1pm on 21 July, the Western Cape has 12 254 active cases of COVID-19, with a total of 85 009 confirmed cases and 70 061 recoveries.
