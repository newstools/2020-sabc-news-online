Eastern Cape Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba has assured members of Parliament that there is no corruption involved in the purchasing of the scooters intended to transport patients. She appeared before a virtual meeting of Parliament’s Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs committee on the province’s plan of action to deal with COVID-19. The scooters, at a cost of R10 million, were initially introduced to be used to ferry patients, but Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has since come out saying that they were not fit for the purpose. Gomba assured MPs that there is nothing untoward about the scooters. “There is by no means an area of corruption. People thought this is corruption, but they are free to look at books.” In the video below, DA member of parliament Siviwe Gwarube says Mkhize is contradicting himself:  Last month, Mkhize and Eastern Cape Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba unveiled the six scooters fitted with a bed on one side, an overhead gazebo with a first aid kit and oxygen on board.
