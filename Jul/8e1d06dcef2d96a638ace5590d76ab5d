G4S South Africa has denied that three of the company’s employees died from COVID-19. “We can confirm that over the past month, three of our colleagues at the G4S Crown Mines branch have tragically passed away and we would like to extend our deepest sympathies to their families and loved ones.  We do not have confirmation that these passings are COVID-related,” says the company’s Managing Director, Renso Smit. The comment follows Tuesday’s sit-in, sparked by the deaths, outside the company premises in Crown Mines, Johannesburg, by over 200 G4S employees. The employees demanded that they all be tested for COVID-19. They also wanted all vehicles, including the trucks used to collect and deliver cash, and the entire Crown mines building to be disinfected. “Since the onset of the pandemic in South Africa, G4S has applied the strictest COVID-19 protocols, which include the provision of PPE, social distancing, deep cleaning, the rotation and management of shifts, and employee screening. G4S has also followed all protocols related to COVID-19, as set out by the government,” says Smit. Smit says the Department of Labour has inspected the facility at Crown Mines and has given it the all clear and all operations resumed on Wednesday.
