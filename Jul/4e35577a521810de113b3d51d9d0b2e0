Experts say the resignation of Power Utility Eskom Non-Executive Director Sifiso Dabengwa has come as a surprise. In a statement, Eskom Interim Chair, Malegapuru Makgoba, said Dabengwa tendered his letter of resignation to Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan last week. The cash strapped Power utility has not explained reasons for his resignation. Eskom has been battling to keep the lights on again amid unplanned maintenance of power stations – even as power demand plummets during the lockdown. Corporate law attorney, Matodzi Ratshimbilani says, “It comes as a surprise. As you know the Eskom board had to be changed several times. The current board was touted as having well experienced people. Dabengwa was one of them. It is a great loss for Eskom. Sometimes when members don’t agree they resign and let other people with different views take the company forward.” Below is Sifiso Dabengwa’s resignation letter:
