President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed the Border Management Authority Bill into law. The law enables a better-coordinated border management service that will ensure safe travel and legitimate trade across borders. The new law will see the establishment of the Border Management Authority. The aim of this bill is to replace the current challenge of different agencies and organs of government all playing different roles in managing aspects of border control. The law sets out terms of office, conditions of service and functions and powers. Ultimately, the aim of the legislation is to contribute to the security of the country, the ease of trade and the general movement of persons and goods in and out of the country. The new law is effective immediately.
