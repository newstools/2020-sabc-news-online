Colombia’s confirmed coronavirus infections tipped across the 100 000 case threshold on Wednesday, as the country’s quarantine measures roll on and intensive care units fill. Confirmed coronavirus cases now number 102 009, the Health Ministry said, 54 941 of which are active. Some 3 470 people have died. The mayor of the country’s capital Bogota said over the weekend the city should prepare for a stricter lockdown as ICUs reached 70% capacity, but ruled out tougher measures after the national government turned over hundreds of additional ventilators. Colombia has fewer confirmed cases per million people than neighbors like Chile, Peru, Panama and Brazil, according to data from Oxford University. The Colombian government says Chile, Panama and Uruguay top it in tests per million inhabitants. Colombia is doing about 15,000 tests per million residents, with a COVID-positive rate of about 16%, according to the government.
