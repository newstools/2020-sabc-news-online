Teacher union, SADTU, has expressed concern about the Department of Basic Education’s decision to reopen schools, saying they ignored warnings to wait until September 2020. SADTU’s National Executive Committee is calling for the closure of all schools until after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are growing calls to suspend schooling as many facilities are recording positive coronavirus cases. SADTU General-Secretary Mugwena Maluleke,says they are worried about the rapid increase in coronavirus cases. “The decision of the National Executive to call for the schools to close for the period was informed by the following. The peak in the country. The virus is reaching its peak and at the same time, we are in the winter season which is known for its influenza impact. The community infections have been continuing since the reopening of the schools and inevitably affecting the schools. We call on the minister of basic education through the NICD to use this peak period to provide answers to the teachers and to curb the spread and to save lives in our country”.

SADTU says the country failed to follow the World Health Organisation guidelines on reopening schools, resulting in an increase in the number of teachers and learners infected by COVID-19. Meanwhile, the leader of the One South Africa Movement Musi Maimane is calling for teachers and learners to stay home on Friday in protest of the government’s decision to reopen schools. Maimane is taking his campaign to see school gates shut in the wake of rising COVID 19 infections to the street – having been thwarted by the courts.
