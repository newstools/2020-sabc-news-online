The case of eight suspects linked to the VBS Mutual Bank saga will resume on the 8th of October this year at the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Ekhuruleni, Gauteng. On Monday morning, the last accused Phillipus Truter appeared in court and was granted bail of R50 000. The former chief financial officer of the now-defunct bank, who was arrested on Friday, plans to plead guilty to the charges against him. He faces 47 charges of fraud, theft, money laundering, corruption, and racketeering. Former VBS CFO granted R50 000 bail:  Seven other suspects were arrested last month and have already appeared in court following the alleged theft of more than R2 billion from the bank. NPA Spokesperson Sipho Ngwema says, “The accused approached the state for negotiations with regards to the charges, but he has also indicated that he is going to plead guilty to the charges. So, the state is engaging with him. So, we have to wait and see what the outcome of the negotiations will be.” In the video below, SABC News looks at the case ahead of Truter’s appearance:  ‘ANC officials involved’ As SABC’s Chriselda Lewis reports from the courthouse, two of the ANC officials in Limpopo were also alleged to have been involved. Last week, the ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule announced to the public that after a National Executive Committee meeting they decided to lift the suspensions of these two ANC Limpopo officials who’d been on suspension for two years.
