Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi has been discharged from hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus nearly two weeks ago. He was admitted to the Steve Biko Academic Hospital eight days ago on the advice of his doctor. In a statement, Cabinet Spokesperson Phumla Williams says, “Though he has been discharged from hospital, he will remain in self-quarantine until he fully recovers. The Minister, together with his family, have thanked all South Africans for the well wishes during his hospitalisation. We are also grateful that Minister Nxesi is now on his way to full recovery. We take this opportunity to wish all fellow South Africans who are battling this disease well, as we also send those who have lost loved ones our sincere condolences.” Nxesi is one of four cabinet ministers to test positive for the virus. They include Trade and Industry Minister, Ebrahim Patel, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula who has since recovered. Mantashe was discharged on Monday. More than 287 000 South Africans have recovered from the virus.
