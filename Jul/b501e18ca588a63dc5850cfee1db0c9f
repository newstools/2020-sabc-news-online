South Africa’s consumer confidence has slumped to minus-33 points in the second quarter compared to minus-nine points in the first quarter. This dismal reading is only three points away from the all-time lowest consumer confidence level of minus-36 recorded in 1985.

The consumer confidence index is compiled by the Bureau for Economic Research. The survey was conducted in the first two weeks of June, when most retail outlets were open as the country had shifted from Alert Level 4 to Level 3.
