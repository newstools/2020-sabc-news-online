The Gauteng Education Department says parents have up to the end of July to submit all the necessary documents for admissions of their children to Grades 1 and 8 for 2021. The department says it has received about 500 000 applications for the grades for the 2021 academic year before the deadline for applications expired on Saturday night. Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona says those parents who were unable to submit all the necessary documents can still hand them in at the schools they wish their children to attend. “We want to encourage parent to make the necessary arrangement with the schools and submit those documents that is before the 31st of July 2020. The placement period will then commence in around October. That is when we will be interacting with parents to say they are placed at certain schools or at schools that they might have applied to.” Mabona earlier appealed to parents to ensure that all relevant documents have been submitted. “We just want to appeal to parents, to those that have not uploaded their documents; they need to go back into the system and make sure that they upload the necessary documents so that the application process will then be complete. It will be difficult to assist if you don’t have documents, but we want to also remind them that they can still submit those documents up until the 31st of July.” Parents experienced technical glitches in the first hour of the application process while the process was marred in controversy in 20201. The Gauteng Department had assured parents that the online application system is efficient.
