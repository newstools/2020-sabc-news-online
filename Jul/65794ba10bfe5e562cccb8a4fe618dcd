The Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation has described struggle stalwart Andrew Mlangeni as “a giant who opposed injustice to his dying day.” In a statement, the Foundation says: “South Africa today mourns the death of Tata Andrew Mlangeni, the last surviving member of an extraordinary cohort of anti-apartheid movement leaders sentenced alongside Nelson Mandela to life imprisonment at the conclusion of the so-called Rivonia Trial.” Mlangeni was admitted to the 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria on Tuesday evening following an abdominal complaint. The Foundation further described Mlangeni, who turned 95 last month, as a principled and modest man.

The Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation extends heart-felt condolences to the Mlangeni family. May Tata Mlangeni rest in peace and rise in glory.”
