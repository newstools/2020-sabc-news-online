Public Works Minister, Patricia De Lille, says she has appointed a law firm to advise her on disciplinary action to be taken against several officials implicated in alleged fraud in her department. The officials, who include the department’s Director General Sam Vukela, are implicated in the alleged fraud related to the funerals of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and ambassadors Zola Skweyiya and Billy Modise. A forensic investigation report by auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers implicated Vukela and several others in fraudulent contract management and irregular payments in the three state funerals. The committee has directed the Minister to give the report to Vukela, who says he has not seen it even though it was commissioned by him. “On the 11th of June this year I engaged with state attorney to appoint after a look at several law firms we agreed to appoint Cheadle, Thomson and Haysom and the firm has already commenced with the process and have provided me with a draft of preliminary charges which I received on the 2 July,” says De Lille.
