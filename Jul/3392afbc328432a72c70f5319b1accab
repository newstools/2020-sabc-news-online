Gauteng Department of Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona has urged parents to continue to apply for online application for Grades 1 and 8 ahead of the deadline. The deadline is looming for online applications for placements at Gauteng schools for the 2021 academic year. The Gauteng Education department also called on parents who have applied but have not yet uploaded the required documents online to do so urgently. The application system for Grade 1 learners, Grade 8 and learners changing schools will close this coming Saturday. Gauteng Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona says, “Parents need to go to www.gdeadmissions.gov.za and apply. We have seen that most parents have applied, but they have not uploaded their documents. The system is user friendly and it will allow parents to upload documents. “So, we encourage parents (to) go, upload documents because if you don’t upload it will be difficult for the process to be finalised. Parents don’t even need to visit our schools because the system can allow them to upload documents,” Mabona explains.
