The Western Cape now only has about four-thousand more confirmed coronavirus cases than Gauteng. This comes as health experts predict that Gauteng could soon become the COVID-19 epicentre again, as the province continues to see a rapid increase in new infections recorded daily. According to the latest national figures, Gauteng’s total confirmed cases now stand at 66 891 after recording three thousand 487 new infections overnight. The Western Cape’s total recorded cases are 70 938. Gauteng could possibly become the COVID-19 epicentre in the next day or two, if it continues to record two to three times more daily new infections than the Western Cape. By Friday evening, Gauteng had 12 605 less confirmed cases than the Western Cape. By Saturday evening, it had 9 003 less confirmed cases than the current epicentre. On Sunday evening, it had recorded 6 127 less total confirmed cases than the Western Cape.
