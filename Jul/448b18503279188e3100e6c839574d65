The South African Medical Association (Sama) says it does not believe in the re-introduction of stricter lockdown measures, as it could negatively impact the economy. The Gauteng government has been meeting to consider the possibility of enforcing stricter lockdown restrictions in the province amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. Gauteng has seen a rapid rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and authorities have said it is likely to become the country’s next COVID-19 hotspot. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has also been calling for the country to revert to level 5 lockdown.

At least 282 people have died from COVID-19 related illnesses in the province. Sama Gauteng chairperson Dr Mark Human has called on people to take responsibility for their safety. “Not only will you cripple the economy, but allow it to spread unfettered in the lockdown areas. I think the lockdown is absolutely not the way to go. I think what we need to do is for people to take responsibility. What we are seeing out in the streets is people sitting in coffees shops and people standing in groups on the side of the road talking to each other with no social distancing, no masks. People travelling in full taxi with windows closed and no masks. So it is that kind of thing where people need to start to take responsibility,” says Dr Human.
