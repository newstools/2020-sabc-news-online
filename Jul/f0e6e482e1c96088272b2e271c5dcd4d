Power Utility Eskom has announced the resignation of its Non-Executive Director, Sifiso Dabengwa. In a statement, Eskom Interim Chair Professor Malegapuru Makgoba says Dabengwa tendered his letter of resignation to Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan last week. SABC News has seen the letter. In it, Dabengwa says the decision was over the board’s decision to implement the findings of a report that he doesn’t agree with as it had failed to address the core issues of his complaint regarding Eskom management’s efforts to induce the board to cancel a disputed tender. “The report finding that the allegations of fraud and corruption were only provided as information and it was for the board to decide what to do with the information is disingenous. The allegations were provided as reason for the cancellation, and was intended to induce and influence the board’s decision,” he says. He adds that: “The issue was the was the absence of any proven evidence and relevance of these allegations to the particular tender under consideration. This was not dealt with appropriately in the report. To date, there has been no evidence of fraud and corruption to the tender in question.” Dabengwa says his parting with the company is based on the fundamental differences of principle with other board members. Eskom has accepted the resignation and wished Dabengwa well. Eskom has been battling to keep the lights on again amid unplanned maintenance of power stations, even as power demand plummets during the lockdown. It has also embarked on a clean-up campaign following allegations of corruption and state capture.
