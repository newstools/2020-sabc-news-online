The wet and cold weather system that is currently hitting the Western Cape will show its better side in the Eastern Cape, as the province will not receive the brunt of its force. This according to spokesperson the Port Elizabeth Weather Office in Port Elizabeth, Garth Sampson. The province expects high winds and little rain along the coast, but it is not expected to move up towards the highlands. Sampson says that conditions are expected to clear from Wednesday. “As the system moves over our area, we can expect strong to gale force winds with high seas between Plettenberg Bay and Cape St Francis spreading east wards and possibly reaching the Wild Coast by Tuesday. Anglicism Marine Community are advised to take the necessary precautions: these conditions will persist until Tuesday and will be accompanied by wet and very cold conditions over most of the Eastern Cape,” says Sampson. Meanwhile, the Cape of Storms is living up to its reputation with gale force winds wreaking havoc in the Mother City. Authorities have urged residents to stay indoors on Monday where possible. Gale force winds have flattened some mobile classrooms at Nomzamo High School in Strand, as a severe storm moves across the Western Cape. Learners and teachers have been sent home. The Western Cape Education Department says they will send a team to assess the damages and then determine when the school can be safely reopened. Roofs were also blown off in Athlone and trees uprooted in Tokai, Somerset West and Newlands. The Disaster Management Centre says storm surges and waves of up to 12-metres are expected in some coastal areas.
