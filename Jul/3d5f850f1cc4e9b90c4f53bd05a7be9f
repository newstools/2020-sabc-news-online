Political Analyst, Ongama Mtimka says the recent allegations against the Presidential Spokesperson, Khusela Diko are further damaging the reputation of the African National Congress (ANC) and President Cyril Ramaphosa. Diko has taken leave of absence, amid a probe into the awarding of two contracts for the supply of PPEs to Royal Bhaca Projects, a company in which her husband is a director. The contracts have since been cancelled. Tyrone Seale has been appointed to act in Diko’s position. Reacting to Diko’s decision to take a leave of absence, Mtimka says, “I think Khusela is taking the right decision to help save the office from reputational damage that was already coming as a result of these allegations. One may argue that she still had some ties before the case was made to her husband and her, but I think it is the right decision by her. I think in general the ANC and President Ramaphosa have lost credibility on this.” ANC to meet on Wednesday The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng says its Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) will meet on Wednesday to discuss the recent allegations against two of its members, Diko, and Gauteng Health MEC, Dr. Bandile Masuku. ANC Gauteng spokesperson, Bones Modise, says a press conference will be held on Thursday to clarify the party’s position on the matter.

He said, “The President must do an honourable thing and ask her to step aside in defence of the integrity and the image of that office.”  Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he has signed a proclamation authorising the Special Investigating Unit to immediately probe the procurement of goods including Personal Protective Equipment during the national state of disaster.
