Limpopo’s Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba is calling on members of the public not to stigmatise health workers but appreciate their efforts in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Ramathuba says health workers are sacrificing their lives, serving selflessly as espoused by the late former President Nelson Mandela. This comes as the country and the world marks International Nelson Mandela Day. She was speaking at the Nobody clinic outside Polokwane, which was the 350th to be built and opened by Mandela. “My only hope my last line of defence against COVID is this last line of defence that we see standing behind me behind them is my grave so that’s why when I think of health care workers and I think the danger that they expose themselves to. I always cry and always ask for the community that what we can do for them is to pray for them what we do for them as the department is to make sure that we don’t compromise when it comes to PPEs for them,” says Ramathuba.
