The National Taxi Alliance says it has placed itself in the hands of the National Coronavirus Command Council in its appeal to load to full capacity and expand routes. Last week, the NTA joined Santaco in a nationwide call to fill taxis to full capacity and reintroduce cross-border transport. But after meeting with the National Coronavirus Command Council, which included presentations from Professor Salim Abdool Karim, the NTA backed down. Briefing Parliament’s Transport Portfolio Committee, NTA president Francis Masitsa said, “The NTA will pronounce itself after finality has been reached by the National Corona Command Council. We do, however, reserve the right to pursue all legal avenues possible in case we feel aggrieved. I want to publicly declare today that at no stage will NTA agitate disobedience.” In the video below, Santaco, National Alliance brief Parliament’s Transport Portfolio Committee:
