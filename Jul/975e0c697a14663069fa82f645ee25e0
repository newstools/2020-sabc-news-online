The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has called for an immediate investigation into allegations of corruption in the awarding of a multi-million rand tender for the provision of personal protective equipment in the provincial Health Department. A R125-million tender was awarded to Royal Bhaca, a company owned by the husband of presidential spokesperson and Gauteng ANC PEC member, Khusela Diko. It has now emerged that Diko has close ties with ANC Johannesburg Councillor Loyiso Lugayeni-Masuku, the wife of Gauteng Health MEC, Bandile Masuku. The DA’s Jack Bloom says it is outrageous that anyone could seek to profit from the COVID-19 crisis in Gauteng, while health staff complain about a lack of PPE. “I think it is critically important that there is no cover up of the alleged corruption in the Gauteng Health Department with PPE contracts. It’s hundreds of millions of rands and it’s utterly that people could seek to make profits out of the misery of others especially since we are trying to fight this COVID-19 pandemic. I really think there should be a full investigation, this time with consequences.” Fishy Gauteng PPE contracts (…) | https://t.co/JJy8rKyexO https://t.co/9p4x2iWTa6 — Jack Bloom (@JackBloomDA) July 23, 2020
