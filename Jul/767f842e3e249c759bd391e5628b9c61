When I proposed a national demonstration I knew the risks. But it is sickening for the state to pretend to care about COVID 19 lives yet send me messages threatening to kill me and my family. — Jacob Ngarivhume (@jngarivhume) July 19, 2020   Award winning #Zimbabwe journalist Hopewell Chin’ono says his house has broken into by state authorities. Could it be because he has been fearlessly reporting about the situation in #Zimbabwe from social issues right through to wanton corruption and looting? pic.twitter.com/AkUgIwXqzl — Peter Ndoro (@peterndoro) July 20, 2020  The Movement for Democratic Change Alliance and other human rights organisations have condemned the arrests. We condemn the arrest and persecution of journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and activist Jacob Ngarivhume. Section 67 of the Constitution gives every person the right to challenge the Govt.

They are furiously hunting for me, Hopewell Chin’ono and Promise Mkwananzi. — HON Job Wiwa Sikhala (@JobSikhala1) July 20, 2020  1. Yesterday I said the regime would throw up a trick to divert attention from the looting under the Farm Mechanisation Scheme. The arrest of Hopewell Chin’ono & Jacob Ngarivhume is supposed to do that. Regime wants to take back control of the narrative. But #PayBackOurMoney — Alex T Magaisa  (@Wamagaisa) July 20, 2020  Hopewell and Jacob Ngarivhume are being denied access to lawyers and this violates the Constitution of Zimbabwe.#JULY31 #ZanuPFMustGo — Team Pachedu  (@PacheduZW) July 20, 2020  Rights activists have started a social media, calling for the release of the duo. Tsitsi doing her thing.

We thank them and others for bringing to light why we are suffering with no salaries, hospitals are collapsed etc #FreeHopewell #FreeJacob — Dr Peter Magombeyi (@DMagombeyi) July 21, 2020  It takes courage to be Zimbabwean. It takes hope to be passionate about this teapot. To tweet, retweet about it every day. To buy data and WiFi because of it.
Abuse is now normal to us. It’s inevitable. It’s going to happen somewhere, somehow. #FreeHopewell. @nelsonchamisa pic.twitter.com/CFdUte4J0x — sweetheart.zw (@zw_sweetheart) July 21, 2020
