The low interest loan is worth around R70.6 billion ($4.3 billion). This comes after the African Development Bank last week approved a R4.7 billion loan to South Africa as part of its COVID-19 response facility, while the New Development Bank approved about R16.4 billion  loan as part of its COVID-19 Emergency Programme. This is the first time Pretoria has sought a loan from the IMF since the dawn of democracy in 1994. According to Bloomberg, under the special drawing rights with the IMF, the loan would be payable over three to five years at an interest rate of just over 1%. More than 70 countries have received financial assistance from the IMF to help in efforts to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
