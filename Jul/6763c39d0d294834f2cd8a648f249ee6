Queen Noloyiso Sandile’s son prince Jonguxolo Sandile has been named as her successor. The announcement was made during her funeral at Mngqesha Great Place outside King Williams Town in the Eastern Cape. The Regent Queen of the Amarharhabe Nation took the reigns after the death of her husband King Maxhoba Sandile in 2011. Family spokesperson Prince Xhanti Sigcawu says the 28- year-old prince is now ready to lead the Amarharhabe nation. “We requested the late Queen to act as a Queen Regent which she did until the last day and after that we met and took a decision that Jonguxolo should take the baton. Jongixolo is now close to his thirties and he’s ready to lead and we will be there to support him,” says Sigcawu. Prince Jonguxolo Sandile paid a moving tribute to his late mother. The queen died at Cecilia Makhiwane Hospital in Mdantsane on Wednesday. The prince has described his mother as a humble and caring person. “Our stories are endless of laughing together and fighting through the toughest situations together that alone made me and my sister inseparable and we will forever love you…I have never come across someone so humble.” Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane says the provincial government will engage with the successor and family of the late Queen Noloyiso Sandile, to look at ways of honouring her. Mabuyane has described Queen Noloyiso as a role model whose legacy and contribution to the development of the kingdom will live on for generations to come through her people. “Indeed she was a very humble, down to earth person, very stable and brought that stability as well and she brought that unity. Indeed we have lost a very important person in our province. Her contribution indeed was actually unparalleled, so government we will work together with the kingdom as we have been doing.” LIVE: Queen of AmaRharhabe Noloyiso Sandile’s Special Official Funeral
