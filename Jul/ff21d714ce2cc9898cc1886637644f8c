President Cyril Ramaphosa says late struggle stalwart Andrew Mlangeni belonged to an era of a tireless struggle of sacrifice, service of honour and integrity. It was an era of leaders who had embodied the best of humanity. Ramaphosa delivered the eulogy at Mlangeni’s funeral service at the University of Johannesburg’s Soweto Campus. Mlangeni, who was the last surviving Rivonia trialist, died last Tuesday at the age of 95, following an abdominal complaint. His funeral service will be followed by a burial service at Roodepoort cemetery. Mlangeni has been accorded Mlangeni a Special Official Funeral Category One. Ramaphosa says Mlangeni’s legacy lives in the freedom felt and experienced by South Africans today. President #Ramaphosa: The Mlangeni family deeply mourns their father who was ‘the pillar of the family’, as his son Sello reminded us last week. The family, like those of other prisoners, suffered immensely during his 26 year imprisonment.
