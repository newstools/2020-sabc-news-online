The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Friday morning hear testimony from the former director-general of the State Security Agency (SSA), Jeff Maqetuka. Last year, the inquiry heard testimony that the SSA had initiated a probe into the Gupta family when it was revealed that the then Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, knew about his inclusion in the Cabinet in 2009, allegedly from one of the members of the Gupta family. The probe was subsequently halted by then State Security Minister, Siyabonga Cwele. The proceedings will start at 10am at the City of Johannesburg Old Council Chambers.
