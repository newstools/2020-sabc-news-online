Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday he had undergone another test for the novel coronavirus, after local media reported he had symptoms associated with the COVID-19 respiratory disease, including a fever. Bolsonaro told supporters outside the presidential palace that he had just visited the hospital and been tested for the virus, adding that an exam had shown his lungs “clean.” CNN Brasil and newspaper Estado de S.Paulo reported that he had symptoms of the disease, such as a fever. The President’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the impact of the virus, even as Brazil has suffered one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and 65 000 related deaths, according to official data on Monday. The right-wing populist has often defied local guidelines to wear a mask in public, even after a judge ordered him to do so in late June. Over the weekend, Bolsonaro attended multiple events and was in close contact with the US ambassador to Brazil during July 4 celebrations. The US embassy in Brasilia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolsonaro previously tested negative for the coronavirus after several aides were diagnosed following a visit to US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Florida, estate in March.
