Teaching and learning have been disrupted at several schools in the Ukhukho area in Ulundi in northern KwaZulu-Natal. They say they are also concerned about overloaded scholar busses and a lack of social distancing at schools. Parents Ncamisile Dlame-Ziqubu and Funani Khumalo have this to say: “We do want our children to be educated. But we can not prioritise education over our children’s lives. If the health officials are not coming to resolve this issue, we won’t mind if our children miss this year and start afresh next year when it’s safer. Our main concern is that the number of infections is growing every day.”
