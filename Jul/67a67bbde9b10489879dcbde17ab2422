The South African Weather Service has warned of a major cold front approaching the country as of Thursday. The cold front is expected to be accompanied by heavy rain, gale force winds and snow in at least six provinces and Lesotho. Joburg Emergency Services Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi has warned residents to be extra vigilant while using heating devices. Mulaudzi says, “We just want to encourage our residents throughout the city to look after all their heating devices as they try to keep warm in this cold front. Things like paraffin stoves, heaters, candles not to leave them unattended. Those using imbawula should use them in well ventilated areas because we want to avoid carbon monoxide inhalation.” An intense #ColdFront will make landfall in the Western Cape early on Friday (10 July 2020) morning. The public and small stock farmers should take note that heavy rain, flooding, gale force winds and snowfall on the high lying areas can be expected.
