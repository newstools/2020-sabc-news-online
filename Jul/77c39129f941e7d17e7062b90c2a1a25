Justice Minister Ronald Lamola says some of the inmates, who were rearrested following an escape from Malmesbury Prison, have been transferred to maximum security facilities. A group of detainees overpowered officials at the Malmesbury Remand Detention Facility on Friday, during exercise time. Correctional services say they took the prison officials’ keys and locked three wardens in a cell. They then opened several other cells, and 68 escaped through the main entrance and over the roof. Addressing the media on Saturday after visiting the facility, the Minister says, “The situation currently has been stabilised and the facility and the emergency support team has been activated furthermore some of the problematic inmates have been transferred out of the facility to the maximum facilities in the region the centre is currently under lockdown we want to ensure communities that we will do everything in our power to apprehend the remaining escapees,” says Lamola.
