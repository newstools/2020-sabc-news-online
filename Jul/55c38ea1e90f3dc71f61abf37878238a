Eastern Cape Premier Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane has expressed concern about the increasing number of COVID-19 related fatalities in the province. The province is the third hardest hit in the country. Speaking during a media briefing in Bhisho, Mabuyane said funerals remained the biggest risk gatherings for spreading the virus. “In the month of July, we have suffered 432 casualties from COVID-19 related illnesses. This takes a total number of casualties in our province to 831 we wish families of the deceased strength and healing during this time. We want the families of the deceased to note that we appreciate the sacrifice they are making in complying with COVID-19 regulations.” Meanwhile, the head of Endocrinology at Groote Schuur Hospital says diabetics who suffer COVID-19 symptoms, should present themselves for testing as soon as they start feeling ill and not wait for the symptoms to worsen. Associate Professor Joel Dave says this will provide doctors with more time to treat and save them from dying. Analysis by the Western Cape Department of Health on about 2 200 COVID-19 fatalities, has found that nearly half had pre-existing diabetes conditions. Joel says most diabetics are only tested for COVID-19  when they are admitted to the hospital. Eastern Cape government updates on coronavirus statistics in the province. Opposition parties have also called for Section 100 to be evoked in the province to help deal with the pandemic.
