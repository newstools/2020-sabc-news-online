The community of Ha-Gumbu village outside Musina in Limpopo says another group of elephants invaded the village and uprooted irrigation pipes, crops and fencing on Friday night. This was after four other elephants were shot and killed by Environmental Affairs rangers on Friday. The community has called on the rangers to come back and track down the new group of elephants. Community Spokesperson, Mahwasane Mudzweda, says Friday night’s herd includes young elephants and they looked aggressive. “The elephants that came back last night is another group. It is not that group that came to eat our crops. I think the nature conservation people should come and follow that group that came last night, maybe if they shot one they will run away from our place,” says Mudzweda.
