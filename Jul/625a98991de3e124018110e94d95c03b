Eskom has urged customers to use electricity sparingly after two generation units tripped at the Medupi and Tutuka power stations on Tuesday. The power utility says the trip led to a constraint in the power generating system and has warned that the constrained power supply may persist throughout the weekend. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says, “We lost a unit each at Medupi and at Tutuka totaling about 1 300 megawatts. This constraint in the supply situation may persist through the weekend. Eskom teams are hard at work trying to return these units to service. The public’s co-operation in managing demand will help us supply the country’s demand through the peak period. #PowerAlert 1 Generation system is severely constrained as two generation units trip@News24 @eNCA pic.twitter.com/YMey5O6mfw — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) July 7, 2020
