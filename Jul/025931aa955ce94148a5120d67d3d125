KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, has condemned this past weekend’s attack on a taxi in iNanda, north of Durban. A passenger was killed and five other people were injured when gunmen opened fire on the vehicle. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Thembeka Mbhele, says the taxi from the Ndwedwe and District Taxi Association was travelling on the KwaMashu Highway from Durban to Umzinyathi when it was shot at. The police recovered 23 spent cartridges on the scene. Zikalala says he is outraged by the incident. “About an ambush of a taxi full of passengers in the province we wish to register our shock and dismay regarding the cold blooded animalistic point blank shooting of a mini taxi or a minibus full of passengers in iNanda. This is one of the incidents which was captured on mobile cellphone videos resulting in the death and injury of number of people we want to assure the people of KwaZulu-Natal that it is being investigated,” says Zikalala.
