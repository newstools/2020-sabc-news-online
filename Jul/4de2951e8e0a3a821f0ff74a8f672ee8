The City of Johannesburg‘s Finance MMC Jolidee Matongo has welcomed proposals that councillors should not get salary increases this year. Residents were outraged by a proposal that councillors could see their salaries increase by 6% in 2020, while municipalities are predicting billions of rand in revenue shortfall. Matongo was presenting his Medium Term Budget Speech, which dropped the proposed R200 tariff increase for pre-paid electricity and put water and electricity increases at 6.6% and 6.2% respectively. “Madam Speaker we will as a matter of urgency set up a triple unit to expand our own resources within the pressures of economy and the fiscus, we welcome the challenge on the 0% increase for councillors. I am sure each party will have a discussion about this particular matter.” Matongo says the budget has taken to account the current economic climate.
