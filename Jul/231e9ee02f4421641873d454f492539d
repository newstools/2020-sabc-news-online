The accused in the murder case of Amahle Quku of Philippi on the Cape Flats has abandoned his bail application in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. 25-year-old Lona Mzingeli faces a murder charge in connection with the death of the Grade 11 learner. The body of Quku was found naked in the streets of Browns Farm two weeks ago. Activists against Gender-based Violence have called for an end to the murder and raping of women and girls. Different groups that included the ANC Women’s League in the Western Cape and the women’s rights oganisation Ilitha Labantu staged a placard demonstration outside Wynberg Magistrates Court calling for no bail for all those accused of rape and murder. Nombeko Lephuthing of Ilitha Labantu says they want justice. “We are here to support the family of Amahle and we want to make sure that the family gets justice. We hear today that the perpetrator abandoned bail, that he doesn’t want bail anymore. We want him to confess so that he can be sentenced. We want justice for Amahle.” The group also staged a protest against the accused in three separate cases of rape in Philippi and Nyanga. The victims’ ages range between 14 and 70 years. A spokesperson for the ANC Women’s League Linda Baleni says, “As the ANC Women’s League in the Western Cape, we are here to support all the cases in court today. We are saying all those charged with rape must not get bail.” The case of Mzingeli has been postponed to the 6th of October for further investigation.
