Justice Minister, Ronald Lamola, says several cases which were handled by Magistrate Kholeka Bodlani are under review. The KwaZulu-Natal acting regional magistrate was placed on suspension following allegations of leniency in sexual assault cases involving minors. Last week’s suspension of the Umlazi judge came a year after the Magistrates Commission was made aware of the alleged inappropriate sentences. At least eight sentences have so far been overturned by higher courts. Lamola says a number of Bodlani’s cases are being reviewed to ensure justice is served. “Some of them already had been reviewed and some are in the process of that review or appeal. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had taken those up, so the matters are taken up on some of the judgments that she had presided over.” “The NPA is looking at them to ensure that justice is served for the victims. It is gross misconduct, a person unfit to hold office. There are various misdemeanors… like a personal conflict of interest and corruption – those are the things that are looked at by the Magistrates Commission,” adds Lamola.
