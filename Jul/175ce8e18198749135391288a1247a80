The National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) says its members will picket outside the AcelorMittal South Africa offices on Monday over the company’s intentions to layoff workers. The company is consulting workers on the Section 189 process and is contemplating retrenchments. The company has also proposed that salaries and benefits be reduced by 20% as an alternative to job cuts. In the video below, is a discussion on how to deal with pay cuts and retrenchments:  “Our members feel that they must resort to this drastic course of action because of the relentless onslaught that AMSA through the backward management of Kobus Verster the current GCEO, have launched against employees,” says Numsa in a statement. The union says the company is using the COID-19 pandemic as an excuse to restructure and render hundreds of workers unemployed. “Our members are acutely aware of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but they feel that they have no choice but to resort to protest action. They will picket peacefully whilst adhering to social distancing regulations,” the union said in a statement. The picket is scheduled to take place at AMSA in Sedibeng, Vanderbijlpak, Vereeniging, Pretoria and Newcastle.
