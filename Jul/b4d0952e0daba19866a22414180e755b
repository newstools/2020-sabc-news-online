Two people have died after their bakkie fell into a stream in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni.  The Emergency Services team says a man and a woman succumbed to drowning. It says the stream is too deep and a rope had to be used to bring the victims and their vehicle to the surface. Ekurhuleni Emergency Services Spokesperson, Erick Maloka, says Dr R Marokane Drive is closed and has requested motorists to use alternative routes. “At about 06:00 this morning, the Tembisa search and rescue team responded to an accident at Dr R Marokane Drive in Tembisa. They could only see one patient. They started with their search and rescue and they managed to observe another patient. Both of them have succumbed to drowning,” says Maloka.
