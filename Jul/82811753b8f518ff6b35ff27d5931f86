Western Cape Finance Minister, David Maynier, has accused President Cyril Ramaphosa of flip-flopping on the issue of allowing leisure accommodation within provinces. In a statement earlier, Maynier said the Presidency deleted a tweet which listed such accommodation as being allowed under Alert Level 3 and then a few hours later retweeted a new graphic with accommodation for leisure removed. Can somebody at the @PresidencyZA please explain why this tweet has be deleted? pic.twitter.com/1xbgkkZAqm — David Maynier (@DavidMaynier) July 11, 2020  In the new tweet, the Presidency said it picked up the error in its graphic and corrected it. Here are the activities that are now allowed at Level 3. We picked up an error in the previous graphic which suggested that accommodation for leisure travel was permitted. This is not the case.

He says clarity by the national government is now imperative. “This kind of flip-flopping is completely unacceptable at a time when many South African’s livelihoods are on the line and many businesses have done everything necessary to put in place health and safety measures and have already begun to open,” Maynier said in the statement. He has called for clarity from the national government.
