Grades three and 10 learners in Limpopo are no longer expected back at school on Monday. This is according to a statement issued by the provincial Education Department. It says a new date will be communicated later. The department earlier released five dates for the phasing-in of the remaining grades of learners, with the last group expected back in class on August 30. Spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene says the revisions follow consultations with stakeholders. “The Limpopo Department of Education had previously communicated that Grades three and 10 would be phased back to school on the 20th July in accordance with amended directions published in the Government Gazette No 43510, by the Minister of Basic Education on the 7th of July 2020. We have, however, now deemed it preferable, after careful consideration of all key variables in phasing back more learners, to suspend the return of these two grades to class. Further directives on this decision will be communicated in due course.” In the video below, Limpopo’s readiness for the phased return of learners is discussed:
