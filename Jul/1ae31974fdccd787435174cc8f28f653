People have been warned to stay away from the coast-line as bad weather conditions are expected along the coast. National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon says the weather office has issued a warning that rough seas, gale force winds, localised flooding and high sea levels are expected along the coastal line of South Africa. A cold front is expected to reach the Western Cape by Thursday. Lambinon says these conditions could also damage infrastructure. “Gale force winds and high seas expected along the coast may result in damage to infrastructure and beach erosion. Disruption to port and small harbour activities can also be expected. We also appeal to boaters, beach goers, surfers and coastal hikers to be cautious along the coastline and to contact local authorities if they encounter any problems.” Media Release: Bitterly cold, wet and windy weather expected over parts of South Africa over the next few days.
