The Western Cape government has appealed for warm clothing as people battle COVID-19 in their facilities. The appeal was made ahead of Mandela Day, which is on 18 July. Spokesperson, Marika Champion, says many patients will spend time being hospitalised this winter due to the virus. She says patients admitted to the Hospital of Hope at the Convention Centre and Brackengate, are especially in need of warm clothing. “We want to make their environment warmer and friendlier to make their stay more comfortable. Companies and individuals can help by donating care packages for these patients. Some of the highly sought after items are fleecy blankets, socks, toiletries, warm clothing and cloth masks,” says Champion.
