The City of Tshwane Head Administrator Mpho Nawa says he has reluctantly accepted the resignation of the acting City Manager Mavela Dlamini from his administration. Dlamini has resigned as both acting city manager and member of the City of Trshwane Administration, citing ill-health. Nawa says it was not easy to accept Dlamini’s resignation considering the current state of the City of Tshwane. Nawa says he also took into account Dlamini’s age and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic which dictated that he operated offsite. He says it is difficult to work off-site for Dlamini, given his responsibilities as City Manager. Dlamini has been at the helm of the City’s administration since 23 March this year after the departure of embattled Municipal Manager, Moeketsi Mosola last year. The City of Tshwane says the process of appointing a substitute city manager is at an advanced stage.
