Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says scientists who are advising government on COVID-19 should stick to proper professional principles. Malema was addressing his party’s virtual seven-year birthday celebration. In commemorating the day, the party urged its members, supporters and well-wishers to dress in black to mourn the victims of COVID-19. Malema says it should be asked, whose agenda these scientists are serving “The scientists said we should retain strict lockdown regulations if there are more than a hundred infections per day. Currently, and the same scientists are advising government to open schools and loosen strict lockdown regulations. The questions we should ask is who’s agenda are these scientists serving because science must not change due to political convenience,” adds Malema. The video below, is Malema’s full address:  On the postponement of 2021 local elections The EFF has also called for the postponement of next year’s 2021 local government elections to 2024. In commemoration of the day, the party urged its members, supporters and well-wishers to dress in black to mourn the victims of COVID-19. Malema said the coronavirus has deprived political parties their democratic right to canvass for the elections. “We, therefore, call on all political parties to engage in a democratic parliamentary process that should postpone the 2021 Local Government Elections to 2024 and introduce a single elections regime which will mean that there should be only one election in South Africa from 2024 onwards,” adds Malema.
