Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has emphasized the need for taxi drivers and commuters to ensure they wear their masks in the correct way to help slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that taxis, undertaking local trips, will be permitted to increase their capacity to 100% while adhering to safety regulations. Those undertaking long trips will have to adhere to 70% occupancy. There are 276 242 confirmed COVID-19 cases – of which around 135 000 have recovered. Over 4000 people have died from COVID-19-related illnesses. Dlamini-Zuma was speaking during a virtual media briefing in Pretoria. “You can’t enter any form of public transport without wearing a mask. So the drivers must make sure everyone who enters their transport has a mask. It’s not only the responsibility of the driver, passengers must also make sure that nobody comes into the taxi without wearing a mask. It must be a collective responsibility to ensure that everyone does wear a mask. If it is not, there are penalties,” explains Dlamini-Zuma.
