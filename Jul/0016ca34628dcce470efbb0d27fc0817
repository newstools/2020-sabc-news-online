North West Premier Job Mokgoro has been admitted to hospital. Mokgoro tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) on Tuesday. Mokgoro tested after Cooperative Governance MEC Gordon Kegakilwe passed away due to COVID-19 related complications, while Public Works MEC Gaoage Molapisi is in self-isolation after also testing positive. Mokgoro’s Spokesperson Vuyisile Ngesi says the premier decided to self-isolate in a medical facility. “Yes, the Premier is in hospital. But he has not been hospitalised for reasons that have been said, that he is critical. The premier is in good spirits, in good health. He actually decided to go into voluntary quarantine, at a medical facility, due to a number of people that are present and staying at the official residence with him. But also, there was a whole lot of traffic that was starting to build up of people wanting to come in and out of the official residence after hearing that he’s infected with COVID-19. Therefore, he decided to go into voluntary quarantine.” On Tuesday, Mokgoro said he was not feeling ill. “I’m kicking harder than an ox. I went to test, as a result of my colleague, our fallen hero, MEC Gordon Kegakilwe, and fortunately, the results came back very quickly, and they told me that I’m positive. They were actually saying I’m probably on the recovery side because I told them that I’ve just been feeling feverish over the past two weeks. No difficulties with coughing; no difficulties about breathing; no sneezing. I’m up and about and about. Obviously, given the results, I’m listening to my doctors, who will give me instructions from time to time.” In the video below, Premier Job Mokgoro says he feels highly energetic:
