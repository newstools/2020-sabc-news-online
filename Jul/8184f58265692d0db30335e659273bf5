Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says R4.6 billion has been allocated to provinces and metro municipalities to upgrade more than 300 informal settlements. The Department says there is a need to improve living conditions in informal settlements in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Human Settlements Deputy Director-General Joseph Leshabane says, “As things stand, there are over 300 informal settlements that are planned to be upgraded – that means proper roads have to be put in, land security for occupants, but also services such as sanitation. We are doing this in partnership with those communities and the local municipality. It is the first time that we have a dedicated grant for informal settlements and that will grow going forward, given the huge prevalence of informal settlements across the country.” The Provinces and Metros respectively receive R4.2 billion in the current budget towards. Sisulu added that the department would introduce COVID-19 impact relief measures, including zero penalties for estate agencies for late submission of audited statements until the end of October as well as rearrangements for loan repayment for affordable housing lenders and rental relief to tenants in affordable rental housing.
