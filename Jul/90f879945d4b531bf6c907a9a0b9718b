Former police minister Nathi Nhleko will continue his testimony on Tuesday at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg. Much of Nhleko’s testimony on Monday revolved around his handling of the rendition of five Zimbabwean nationals by senior hawks officials in 2010. Nhleko is today expected to shed light on his decision to appoint Major General Berning Ntlemeza as acting Hawks boss. Colonel Nyameko Xaba is also expected to testify at the commission. Xaba headed the Hawks’ Crime Against the State unit which – according to former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert Mcbride, was used for political agendas and reported directly to Ntlemeza. In the video below, is Monday’s hearing:  On Tuesday, Nhleko complained about the treatment he says he has suffered at the hands of the State Capture Commission. Nhleko says he did not get various notices and affidavits from the Commission timeously or not at all. He adds that he heard the evidence of former IPID officials including that of Mcbride on TV without receiving notice that the evidence implicated him. Speaking through his lawyer William Mkari, Nhleko says he had to threaten the commission with litigation. “When he made follow-ups as to when he will be given the opportunity to give his side of the story given the serious impact of the allegations made by Mr Mcbride to his career prospects and that he is unable to find a job because of that he was told he should wait. Until Mr Nhleko threatened legal action against the commission that he would rather go to court to compel the commission to treat him fairly.”
