Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba says the province has seen a big increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases since the start of the second wave. The MEC says 154 cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Ramathuba says the province now has more than 660 active cases. “We have seen ourselves registering 154 cases bring the total number of the current active cases in our province to be 661 and off course and increment in those who are admitted to our facilities to be 67 and that in itself gives us a lot of warning.” Ramathuba says there are a high number of cases in four local municipalities, including Polokwane. “If you look at Polokwane for instance, the active case index risk per hundred per person is already at 29 and when you look at the second municipality which is Lephalale is at 20. You look at Thabazimbi at 20,9, Bela Bela at 20,8.” Government delegation in Limpopo to assess projects to help post COVID-19 recovery plan:  SA’s latest stats: COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 146819 153085 19561 32553 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 16 DECEMBER 2020 5770 522 617 DEATHS 2100 5230 5135 3510 571 CONFIRMED CASES | 883 687 DEATHS | 23 827 TESTS CONDUCTED | 5 968 692 RECOVERIES | 774 585 60001 372 86163 249181 36063 23850 162574  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
