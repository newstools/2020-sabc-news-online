Swedish authorities have decided to extend a ban on flights from Britain until the new year over fears of a new COVID strain spreading in the United Kingdom, the Swedish Transport Agency said on Wednesday. “I can confirm that the government has decided to extend the ban on passenger flights from Britain until the New Year,” a Transport Agency spokesman told Reuters. Sweden imposed travel restrictions earlier this month on passengers from Britain amid concerns over a new coronavirus strain circulating in the country. Sweden has also issued a general travel ban on all foreigners arriving from Britain and Denmark. Similar measures have been taken by several other countries in the EU and across the world. Sweden registers 6 609 new COVID-19 cases Sweden, whose unorthodox pandemic strategy placed it in the global spotlight, registered 6 609 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, Health Agency statistics showed. The increase compared with high of 9 654 daily cases recorded last week. Sweden registered 112 new deaths, taking the total to 8 279. The deaths registered have typically occurred over several days and sometimes weeks, and are added into the Health Agency’s tally which is updated four times per week. Sweden’s death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns.
