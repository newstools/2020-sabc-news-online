International NGO, the Press Emblem Campaign, has expressed concerns over the rising number of journalists and media workers who are dying from COVID-19 related illnesses. The organisation says nearly 500 media sector workers have died across 56 countries in the past nine months. In its latest report, the campaign says 47 media workers died in November, compared to 22 known deaths in October – as journalists risk their lives while reporting on the front lines amid the pandemic. The Press Emblem Campaign’s General Secretary, Blaise Lempen, says Africa has much less cases. “The figure is very worrying in many parts of the world. For example, in Latin America, the situation is the worst – with more than half of the journalists dead from COVID-19. The good news for Africa is Africa has much less cases with journalist deaths due to COVID-19 – so, 25 in 9 months according to our figures.” #Covid19 is claiming more and more victims in the #media. Near 500 #journalists died from the #coronavirus in 9 months. 47 more in November. A huge loss.
