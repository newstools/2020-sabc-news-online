Former African National Congress (ANC) councillor Andile Lungisa says his interest in politics is driven by his desire to serve the community and is not defined by whether or not he is a councillor. Lungisa spoke to the media following his release on parole from the North End Prison. He was sentenced to two years for assault after he threw a jug on a Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor during a heated council meeting. Lungisa’s future and interest in political positions remain uncertain since he was convicted of a criminal charge. He says he will now begin serving his community away from the chambers. “ Politics have always been my nature, I’m not defined by being a councillor or not a councillor, I’m defined by working for our community on a daily basis. As early as today, and tomorrow that will be my work.” Lungisa addresses the media after his release from prison:  Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo says Lungisa is expected to comply with a specific set of parole conditions and will be subjected to supervision until the sentence expires. On Monday, the Free Lungisa Campaign expressed their optimism over the parole, saying that are ready and eager to welcome him back into society. Lungisa has been released among a group of prisoners to decrease the number of inmates amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Special Remission of Sentences granted by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 16 December 2019 reduced Lungisa’s sentence 12 months. Over 14 000 inmates have benefitted from it.
