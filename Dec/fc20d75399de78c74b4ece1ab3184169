Former Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba intends to challenge in court a report by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane which found that he had meddled in procurement processes. The probe follows an anonymous complaint about irregular staff appointments and salary increases, among other things. Mkhwebane found that action must be taken within 60 working days. Mashaba says he wants his and his wife’s name to be cleared in court. He says, “How the PP would keep on bringing my wife into this is very unfortunate and I think it, as far as I am concerned, is lying to the South African public. Fortunately enough this matter is going to an open court and South Africans will have an opportunity to see cases of statements under oath of my wife’s non-involvement in this matter. I don’t know why she has decided to ignore this.” Former Jo’burg Mayor Herman Mashaba responds to Mkhwebane’s report  Anyone thinking that my wife’s business did business with the City of Johannesburg during my tenure as Mayor must be a figmentation of their imagination. There is more than sufficient evidence, under oath, to prove it. Why this evidence was ignored is beyond imagination https://t.co/2gRcJaXsvU — Herman Mashaba (@HermanMashaba) December 22, 2020
