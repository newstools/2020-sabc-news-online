Matriculants will not rewrite the two leaked matric exam papers after the High Court in Pretoria on Friday set aside the decision of Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga. The court on Friday delivered judgment in an application challenging the Basic Education Department’s decision that the two leaked matric exam papers should be rewritten. The South African Democratic Teacher’s Union (SADTU), lobby group AfriForum and independent learners had brought the urgent court application before the court. The two papers in question are Physical Science Paper Two and Mathematics Paper Two. Minister Motshekga announced last Friday that learners would rewrite the two papers on December 15 and 17, respectively. Motshekga says the papers must be rewritten to protect the integrity of the matric examinations:  In the video below is Thursday’s court proceedings:  Mixed reactions from learners on the rewrite:  The National Professional Teacher’s Organisation of South Africa (NAPTOSA) believes the exam rewrites should have been targeted at the schools where evidence was found of pupils having accessed the leaked exam papers, while the National Teachers’ Union (NATU) Allen Thompson has welcomed the decision for matrics to rewrite.
