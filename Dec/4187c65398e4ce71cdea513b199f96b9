The head of security for the Bushiris, along with his wife, have appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on charges of corruption. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says Clifford and Rosy Resondt are charged with corruption amounting to R500 000. They have been released on bail of R15 000 each and the matter was postponed to February 25, 2021. Rosy Resondt works for the Organised Crime Unit of the police service. It is alleged that in 2018 her husband, Clifford, was arrested for the alleged rape of his wife’s niece. The R500 000 that’s at the centre of the case against the couple, was allegedly then transferred from the bank account of Pastor Shepherd Bushiri’s Ministries to Rosy’s account and then into an account of the victim’s parents. The NPA says the charges against Resondt were later withdrawn by the victim. The couple’s leader, Shepherd Bushiri, and his wife Mary are still in Malawi after having escaped justice in South Africa. Extradition process to get Bushiris back to South Africa under way:  The couple escaped to their home country of Malawi last month, saying prejudice is behind the charges against them and that they won’t receive a fair trial in South Africa. Their co-accused Willah Mudolo will know next week whether he will be released on bail. He has been behind bars since October when he was arrested together with his wife, Zethu. The Mudolos, the Bushiris and Landiwe Ntlokwana, are charged with fraud, theft and money laundering involving more than R100 million. Everyone has been released on bail except Mudolo. His bail hearing was postponed at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday.
