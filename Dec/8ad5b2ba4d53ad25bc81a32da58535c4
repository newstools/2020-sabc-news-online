The African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in the North West has requested the mayor of Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality in Christiana Mpho Pilane to step aside. This after 36-year-old Pilane was charged on two counts of sexual assault, rape and abduction. He allegedly sexually assaulted and raped two girls. Pilane was granted bail of R1000 by the Delareyville Magistrate’s Court on Monday. IPC spokesperson Kenny Morolong says: “The Provincial Working Committee has been consistent with our national conference resolutions and subsequent the August 2020 NEC decision on ANC’s credibility and integrity, it directed that comrade Mpho Pilane should voluntarily step aside from the position of the mayor of Lekwa-Teemane local municipality. We call upon members of the general public to allow law enforcement agencies to continue to conduct their investigation without hindrances.” Women’s League unhappy with granting of bail Meanwhile, the ANC Women’s League in the Ngaka Modiri Molema Region in the North West has since expressed its disappointment that the mayor has received bail. In an exclusive interview with SABC News following his court appearance on Monday, Pilane said he believes his case is politically motivated. He is due in court again in February.
