The Restaurant Association of South Africa (RASA) has welcomed the new restrictions imposed by President Cyril Ramaphosa on the sector. President Ramaphosa announced a new set of national restrictions on Monday night, as the number of coronavirus cases rise amid the pandemic. To prevent super-spreader events, a curfew from 11pm to 4 m has been put in place, with the government ordering that restaurants close by 10pm to allow for staff in the sector to travel home before the curfew kicks in. RASA CEO Wendy Alberts says, “There is a degree of balance that we need to take and the responsibility of people and their behaviour and government has a hard task to mobilise that. We as the industry need to protect our businesses and protect the staff and patrons within the establishment and keep health and safety as a priority.” “The curfew does give us challenges as we have to ensure our establishment is sanitised and clean and ensure that we meet all the health and safety regulations. We are grateful that we have been given the consideration to trade through the festive season,” added Alberts.
