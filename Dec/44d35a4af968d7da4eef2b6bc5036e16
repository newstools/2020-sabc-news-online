The ANC has joined South Africans in mourning the death of former high commissioner to Uganda, Jon Qwelane. He was appointed in 2010. The veteran journalist was the founding member of the Writers’ Association of South Africa. He worked at a number of media houses, as a reporter, editor and radio talk show host. Jon Qwelane passes on:  Qwelane was known for being outspoken against the apartheid government. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says Qwelane served the country with distinction and unwavering commitment. “Qwelane was a fearless and prolific journalist and talk show host who pushed the envelope and influenced public discourse.” Mabe says the ANC sends its condolences to the Qwelane family, friends and the diplomatic community. Tributes have been pouring in for the late journalist. A man of his own views, a hard core & well researched journalist, feared by many, hated by many, loved by many and a rare talent in media circles especially talk radio. #JonQwelane lit theTalk at 9 702 lines & set them ablaze in the heat of things. Unrelenting on his word. MHSRIP — WeziKhoza (@khoza_wezi) December 24, 2020  Our craft – Journalism is shattered by the passing of veteran journalist Jon Qwelane.
