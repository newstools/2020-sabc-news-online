Anglican Archbishop of Southern Africa, Thabo Makgoba, says COVID-19 regulations and protocols must be followed by churches to save lives. The church moved its annual midnight mass held every Christmas Eve at the St George’s Cathedral to 5pm today. Makgoba says this is in line with lockdown restrictions,  including the 11 PM to 4 AM curfew. “The service at the Cathedral this evening will be at 5 PM. It is the first time at least in my 30 years that we have had to shift the service,- but we have to comply with the COVID-19  regulations and restrictions. We have to save lives, we have to encourage social distancing, we have to wash our hands regularly and we have to wear masks. It’s going to be an interesting and unique one. Blessings and Merry Christmas to you all.” In the Nelson Mandela Bay region, Christmas church service will be done using the latest technology due to the devastating impact of COVID-19 which has killed so many South Africans.
