Late registrations are now open for Gauteng public schools for Grade 1 and Grade 8. The Gauteng Department of Education says the online admissions opened on Tuesday for those who have not yet secured a space for the New Year. The department says walk-in centres will open on 18 January 2021. Gauteng education spokesperson, Steve Mabona says the systems will close on 22 January. “All those parents who applied in June/July, unfortunately, may not reapply because the system will not allow them to do so. Parents of unplaced learners may continue to choose available schools in the system and those who could not upload documents may also upload accordingly. It is important to note that, up to so far, we have placed over 211 000 learners across our schools Gauteng.” Our late online registration is officially opened from today, 22nd December to the the 22nd Jan 2021. But please remember it’s only for schools that have available spaces so you won’t find those popular schools on the list.
