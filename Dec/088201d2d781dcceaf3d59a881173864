Fernando Isaacs, the man accused of murdering Bonteheuwel mom of two, Lauren Dryden, is expected to make another appearance in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Isaacs was in court on Monday where he was granted legal assistance. He is accused of murdering Dryden 31 while she was waiting for an e-hailing taxi after finishing a night-shift at her work in Epping. Community leader Angus McKenzie was with a group of protesters outside the court on Monday demanding justice for Lauren. McKenzie says, “The justice for Lauren will be a small consolation for all the other victims who have been failed by SAPS and the criminal justice system. This case provides the criminal justice system with an opportunity to regain public trust and confidence in the courts.” “This repeat offender as indicated by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) cannot be allowed to repeat his actions of terrorising the people of Bonteheuwel, it must stop and it will stop,” added McKenzie
