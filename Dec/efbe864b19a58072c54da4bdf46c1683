A post-exam celebration in North West, has claimed the lives of three matriculants. The Rethusegile Secondary School pupils died in a road crash in Brits on Friday night. They were part of group of learners returning from the celebratory outing, arranged by the school. North West Education has established a team to investigate what it provisionally calls an unauthorised school trip. Three 15-seater taxis were hired. One was involved in an horrific crash on the way back. Three young lives cut short. Other pupils in the taxi and the driver are said to be in critical condition at a Brits hospital. Tshepiso Moagi and Amogelang Diphoko are among the deceased. Mmaletsatsi Moagi, Tshepiso’s mother, is woman in pain, with many unanswered questions. “This child has endured after failing many times. Until 21 years struggling like that, he kept faith like that until his matric finals and his life ended at the time. He finishes what he always wanted.” Johanna Diphoko could not hold back tears, when she remembered her son, Amogelang. “He was my only child and I expected a lot from him because he promised many things. He had good plans.” The Provincial Department of Education MEC, Wendy Matsomela, has set up a team to investigate the matter. “For now, let us term this trip as unauthorised trip, because at all, we are not doing trips, (unless) that trip is an educational trip.” The department has also set up a team to assist the school and families with funeral arrangements.
