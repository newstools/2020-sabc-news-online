Former Eskom legal head, Suzanne Daniels, is scheduled to testify again at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg on Monday. In September, Daniels made allegations at the commission that she was offered R800 million by Gupta associate Salim Essa to reinstate Eskom’s former acting CEO Matshela Koko. Suzanne Daniels says Gupta associate Salim Essa offered her a R800 million bribe:  Daniels alleged she attended a meeting where then-President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane Zuma, former minister of energy Ben Martins and Ajay Gupta were present. At this meeting, Gupta wanted to know how former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s pension legal woes would be sorted out. He indicated to her they would find someone in the Deputy Judge President’s Office to move the case out and that the matter would be easier to deal with once Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma came into power. Daniels said it was then when she had realised that the Guptas thought that they were running the country. Eskom allegedly became a key focus of those involved in state capture, with coal contracts allegedly one of the areas of interest from the Gupta family and others. The hearing is expected to start at 10am.
