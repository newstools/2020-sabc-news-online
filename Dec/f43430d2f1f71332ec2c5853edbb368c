Government has confirmed that an extradition request has been served to Malawi for Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) Pastor Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary. The submission follows a request for a provisional arrest which was sent through Interpol. The fugitive couple fled South Africa for Malawi in November in contravention of their bail conditions over a multi-million rand fraud and money laundering case. The ECG church leader Shepherd Bushiri addresses the public from Malawi following his escape from South Africa:  Justice Spokesperson, Crispin Phiri, says they are also monitoring the appeal by the Malawian state prosecutors to the High Court in Lilongwe against a lower court decision to grant the Bushiris bail. “We are closely monitoring the appeal process by the Malawian authorities. Minister Lamola believes that given our sound and healthy diplomatic relations, the Republic of Malawi will honour the letter and spirit of every provision of international law and regional law applications.” Shepherd Bushiri hands himself over to Malawi police:  Malawi court decision to grant the Bushiris bail In late November, a Malawian court ordered the release of the fugitive couple. The magistrate ruled that the Bushiris were illegally arrested. The court said that proper processes weren’t followed despite the fact that Interpol had communicated South Africa’s warrant of arrest. The pair of fugitives had brought themselves before law enforcement in Malawi. The court found that the Bushiris surrendered, showing their compliance with Malawian law enforcement.
