President Cyril Ramaphosa is today participating in a one-day Southern African Development Community (SADC) consultation meeting being held in Maputo. The meeting is a follow-up to the SADC Organ Troika Summit recently held in Gaborone, Botswana on 27 November 2020. The Gaborone Summit noted with concern acts of terrorism in the region, particularly in Cabo Delgado province of the Republic of Mozambique, and expressed continued SADC solidarity with Mozambique. The summit also directed the finalisation of a comprehensive regional response and programme of support to the Republic of Mozambique. President Ramaphosa is due to return to South Africa later today. Amnesty International calls for SADC to strengthen laws to protect human rights Amnesty International last week called on law-makers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to strengthen laws to protect human rights amid growing threats in the region. Major threats threatening stability in the region include violations linked to Mozambiqueâ€™s conflict and a clampdown on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly due to COVID-19. The session was attended by members of the SADC Parliamentary Forum Standing Committee on Democratisation, Governance and Human Rights and stakeholders drawn from state and non-state human rights actors, civil society, media and technical partners in SADC.
