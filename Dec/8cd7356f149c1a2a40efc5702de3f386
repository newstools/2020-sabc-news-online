As the wheels of justice continue to grind, more arrests are expected in the over R100 million money laundering, fraud, and theft case involving the fugitive couple, Shepherd and Mary Bushiri.  This emerged during cross-examination in the bail application of Bushiri’s co-accused, Willah Mudolo, in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Investigating officer, Colonel Daniel Marais has agreed when cross-examined by Mudolo’s lawyer that there are other people who were involved in the alleged scheme who have not yet been arrested. Marais told the court that the investigation is expected to be concluded in the next month or so. Marais testified that Mudolo has vast access to money and remains a major flight risk. Mudolo applies for bail:  He was found with two cellphones whilst behind bars in which one has incriminating evidence concerning bribing court officials for bail. The court also heard that he attempted to escape to Dubai on three occasions. His lawyer however put it before the court that he never intended to escape, leaving behind his wife, two children, and a multimillion-rand property. Judgment is expected to be handed down next Tuesday.
