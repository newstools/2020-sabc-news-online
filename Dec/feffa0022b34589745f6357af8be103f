Parisians headed home as a curfew in France came into force on Tuesday at 8pm, while the country lifted a second national lockdown. Shops that normally would close at 8pm closed earlier to allow staff time to head home, although some admitted they forgot the time. The number of people admitted to hospital for COVID-19 in France resumed its decline on Tuesday, ending three straight days of increases as the country replaced a second national lockdown with a nightly curfew. The number of people in France who have died from COVID-19 infections rose by 790 to 59 072, up from 371 on Monday (December 15). The cumulative number of cases in France now totals 2 391 447, the fifth-highest in the world.
