Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has defended his controversial prayer saying he’s concerned about escalating corruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was briefing the media on the 2019-2020 Judiciary Annual report at his offices in Midrand, north of Johannesburg. Social media is abuzz after a video emerged in which Mogoeng delivers a prayer on the caution that must be used when choosing a vaccine to combat the coronavirus. He spoke at an event at Tembisa Hospital, east of Johannesburg, that honoured those who died from COVID-19-related complications. South Africa is in the second wave of infections and has registered the most infections and COVID19-related deaths on the continent. Mogoeng says, “If there is a vaccine that is being manufactured to advance a satanic agenda of the mark of the beast purposes. If there is any vaccine that is being manufactured for the purposes (to) corrupt the DNA of people, that vaccine must die. God must intervene.” WATCH: Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng stands by his stance on the CORONAVIRUS vaccine debate. #SABCNews pic.twitter.com/nYzL3tNk5Z — Abongile Dumako (@AbongileDumako) December 11, 2020  WATCH: Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng responds to the back lash, following his prayer at the Tembisa Hospital #thanksgiving function on Thursday. #SABCNews pic.twitter.com/nMNSY31aqc — Abongile Dumako (@AbongileDumako) December 11, 2020  In the video below, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng unpacks the Judiciary annual report:
