The High Court in Pretoria has denied an application to have the government’s decision on the closure of beaches declared unconstitutional. AfriForum along with various businesses and organisations applied to the court citing the disastrous economic effects the closures would have on the provincial economies. As South Africa experiences a second wave of coronavirus infections as well as the emergence of a new variant of the virus, the government took a decision to close all beaches in the Eastern Cape and Garden Route whilst KwaZulu Natal will close on the busiest days of the season. The other applicants were Great Brak Business Forum, the Kouga local municipality and Buffelsbaai Homeowners Association who wanted the ban on the closure of the beaches to be overturned. Tourism industry dealt a severe blow with second wave travel ban  DA’s challenge against Garden Route beach closure dismissed The High Court in Cape Town has dismissed the Democratic Alliance (DA)’s challenge against beach closure on the Garden Route. The DA says it is disappointed by the judgment handed down by the High Court in Cape Town. DA leader John Steenhuisen welcomes the amended hours from 9AM to 6PM to 6AM to 7PM. “The DA is still deeply concerned that the blanket closure of the Garden Route’s beaches over the festive season will have far-reaching and devastating consequences for local economies, and for the livelihoods, which depend on seasonal tourism during this time.” “While we respect the judgment, we understand that this ruling remains a devastating blow to the thousands of small businesses along the Garden Route, which are now at serious risk of collapse. This problem will not go away once South Africa emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, and we cannot ignore the risk to livelihoods which many lockdown restrictions present. The DA will continue to act in both the interests of the lives and livelihoods of South Africans during the coronavirus pandemic to ensure that we keep citizens safe and that we still have an economy left once the dust has settled.”  COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 162680 161186 20519 33493 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 22 ﻿DECEMBER 2020 6 359 533 624 DEATHS 2 139 5 ﻿719 5 226 3 703 571 CONFIRMED CASES | 940 212 DEATHS | 25 246 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 215 728 RECOVERIES | 808 241 60805 372 86163 259962 37090 24300 180177  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
