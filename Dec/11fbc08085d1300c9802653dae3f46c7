The case against five people arrested in connection with the murder of Prince Lethukuthula Zulu is expected to resume on Wednesday morning at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, north of Johannesburg. Zulu, the eldest son of King Goodwill Zwelithini, was found dead by security guards at his Johannesburg home in Randburg on November 6, 2020. It’s alleged that Zulu (50) had been drugged and his belongings stolen. Tshegofatso Moremane, Margaret Koaile, Portia Mnola, Gontse Tlhoele and Dakalo Mbedzi have been arrested in connection with the murder. They are accused of running a syndicate that drugs people and robs them. During their previous appearance, one of the suspects told the court that she had sexually entertained the Prince at his home and that had suspected he was consuming drugs after noticing a white powder-like substance around his mouth. The accused allegedly stole a microwave, television sets and cash, valued at an estimated R30 000 from Zulu’s apartment. Zulu’s body was discovered later by security guards. Prince Lethukuthula was born in 1970 to King Goodwill Zwelithini and his first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini. He completed his lower education at Mlokothwa High school and furthered his tertiary education at the Durban University of Technology and Mangosuthu University of Technology. His sudden death has shocked the Zulu nation. As the eldest son to the King, Prince Lethukuthula has been described as a pillar of strength to the Zulu royal family. Prince Thulani Zulu, the Zulu Royal Household spokesperson says, “Prince Lethukuthula was a humble person, following his name and a man of good character, soft-spoken, very humble and respective and also respectful to others and we will miss him a lot and he was a pride of the family.”
