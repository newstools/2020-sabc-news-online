Mkhize says restrictions should be placed on hotspot areas. “Now that the numbers are increasing, it is going to be important for us to make sure there are further restrictions. We have to talk about restrictions in terms of gatherings and risk areas that we have seen people behaving in a manner that created congestion and easy spread of the infection. I cannot make any speculation on levels, but I do believe that we need some ways of strengthening the containment measures.” Mkhize urges South Africans to abide by COVID-19 regulations:  The latest coronavirus stats in SA:  COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 185946 167239 22896 35162 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 28 DECEMBER 2020 7034 543 638 DEATHS 2160 6366 5356 4020 577 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 011 871 DEATHS | 27 071 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 469 025 RECOVERIES | 849 947 377 86163 276133 38673 24920 199028  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 61874 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
