A number of people have been injured following a massive explosion at one of the chemical plants on Otto Volek Road between Pinetown and New Germany, west of Durban, on Tuesday. Advanced Life Support Paramedic spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, says personnel from various services are on the scene. “Multiple ambulances and emergency vehicles are mobile to Otto Volek Road in Pinetown area, near New Germany, where it’s believed a chemical explosion has occurred at a company. Please give way to all emergency vehicles, reports are that multiple people have been injured.” Strong winds are making it difficult for firefighters to extinguish the fire after the massive explosion. The roads have been closed off. Videos on social media show billowing flames, followed by multiple smaller explosions.

An eye witness, Lee Maharaj, from the Clare Estate Action Committee, is urging drivers to avoid the M19. “We have the Fire Department on scene who are trying to control the blaze but the fire is actually spreading because of the wind. As the explosions are happening, wherever the shrapnel is falling the fire is starting up there. All motorists on the M19 should exercise caution in that area. We do have some people that are trying to weave their way onto the verge of the roads to try and see what’s going on. It is dangerous to do this especially on the blind bends so exercise caution in the area.” Otto Volek road Pinetown factory fire.
