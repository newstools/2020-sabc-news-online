Workers union SAMWU in the Matlosana Local Municipality in Klerksdorp in the North West has welcomed the raid of their municipality by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and the HAWKS. Documents and computers were seized from the municipality’s offices. The SIU is investigating allegations of corruption with the awarding of tenders for personal protective equipment. SAMWU Local Secretary, Oupa Sindi says, “Our members are very happy because it’s been a long time we reporting this maladministration and corruption within our municipality. During March and April there were tenders that were advertised, but at the later stage, it was discovered that there were irregularities within those tenders.” “So we believe that if there is any corruption that is happening within our municipality, we believe in the law enforcement agencies.” SIU Spokesperson Kaiser Kganyago says they received information from a whistleblower: “We are here because there were allegations that were given to us by whistleblowers and the indication was that there is corruption that is happening here at the Matlosana municipality, and we found that there have been some of those contracts that were given to people that are purported to be friends and families of some of the people here. In relation to 47 million that was spent on PPE here.” Below is the interview with Kganyago:
