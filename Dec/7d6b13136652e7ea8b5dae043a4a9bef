Police and the metro police in Nelson Mandela Bay conducted the second night of spot checks in Port Elizabeth to ensure partygoers adhere to the state of disaster regulations. The police operations are part of the city’s efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The police paid a visit to night spots in Humewood and the northern areas of the city. Lack of compliance was recorded at most of the venues. The acting Director of Communications for Nelson Mandela Bay, Princess Tobin Diouff, says there is also confusion regarding the curfew, with some believing it only starts at 23h00 and not at 22h00. “Unfortunately because Nelson Mandela Bay is a hotspot, our curfew time is different to that of the rest of the country. The curfew time here is 10pm to 4am. Meaning that whatever you do must be done by 9pm to 9.30pm and by 10 o’clock you need to be inside your house. And we have found out that a lot of people are still drinking in the streets, there is no social distancing people are sharing hookah pipes. People are not wearing masks. These are the problems that are causing the spread of the coronavirus in the city,” says Diouff.
