Traffic outside the Beitbridge border post into Zimbabwe is now backed up all the way to Musina, about 14 kilometres from the border post. Chairperson of the Beitbridge Transport and Clearing Agency Association, Eugene Khoza, believes the situation would have been better if the border was operating on a 24-hour basis. However, Home Affairs Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, says truck drivers are to blame for the current congestion at the Beitbridge Border Post, as hundreds of Zimbabweans return home for Christmas. Eugen Khoza says, “All the plans were cancelled when the minister of the police arrived at the border and gave orders that the border should close 10 o’clock in the evening and open early at 4 o’clock in the morning. So, that thing affected us in a big way. The officials for Sars, police and immigration are not arriving on time at the workplace.” Cele monitoring adherence to COVID-19 regulations at the Beitbridge border post at Musina:   Motsoaledi says most truck drivers do not have the documentation required to cross the border and are, therefore, blocking all other travellers who are ready to cross with the relevant documentation. “If you go to Beitbridge now, our people are idling there at the border because the theatre of war is not at the border with customs or Home Affairs. It’s on the road where the truckers have blocked while they don’t have documents to pass through. Take them back to Musina, let the truck drivers do administration. They are in the holding areas. Then they will leave the road free. Then all the other pedestrians will not find the congestion. If the truck drivers were playing the game by the rules, we wouldn’t be having this congestion that is there.” Traffic volumes started increasing on Sunday:
