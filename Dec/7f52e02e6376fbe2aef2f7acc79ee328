The South African Pharmacy Council (SAPC) has placed a moratorium on annual fee increases for all pharmacy professionals and facilities. The SAPC which is a 25 member council decided to halt all the fee increases in recognition of the efforts by pharmacy professionals in the fight against COVID-19. The Registrar and CEO of the SAPC Amos Masango says the council is confident that the services offered to both pharmacy professionals and the public will not be affected by this decision. Masango says, “While fee adjustment moratoriums are not sustainable in the long term, particularly due to inflationary pressures on operational expenditure, we recognise that 2020 has been a tough year for the economy and most of our colleagues on the frontline in the war against COVID-19 may have to do with reduced incomes or below-inflation salary increases.”  COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 162680 161186 20519 33493 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 22 ﻿DECEMBER 2020 6 359 533 624 DEATHS 2 139 5 ﻿719 5 226 3 703 571 CONFIRMED CASES | 940 212 DEATHS | 25 246 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 215 728 RECOVERIES | 808 241 60805 372 86163 259962 37090 24300 180177  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); As of Tuesday, the South African Health Ministry reported a cumulative total of 940 212 cases of COVID-19.
