Striking nurses from the  Tshepong hospital in the North West have agreed to return to work while waiting for their outstanding bonuses to be paid. The nurses downed tools this morning forcing the hospital to operate with a skeleton staff. The results of the strike could clearly be seen with hospital linen discarded at the entrance and no patient or staff insight. SABC News was denied access to the facility, but photographs supplied to the broadcaster show dustbins overturned and gloves and pamphlets strewn around the premises. “They promised them in August, there was a circular issued by the administrator they failed to pay,” says Makatane. According to the department, the strike caused minimal disruption, but some patients discharged themselves. This is as the country battles the second wave of coronavirus.
