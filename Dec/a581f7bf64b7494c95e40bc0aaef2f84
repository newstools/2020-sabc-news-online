Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says they are worried that Gauteng will be hit by the biggest wave of COVID-19 infections as soon as next week. Mkhize was providing details of the restrictions of the adjusted level 3 lockdown. “We are worried that in the next week the wave is going to be the biggest in Gauteng and that is a matter of concern for us. We are increasing the testing so that people can be separated quickly as to whether they have COVID or not, but people must come and seek assistance so that we can detect early and help to prevent the spread of the infections,” Mkhize told the media. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the move was part of efforts to slow down the rate of transmissions and reduce the burden on the country’s health services. Mkhize says hospitals are under pressure, but are coping at this stage. “The hospitals are not able to cater for all the people that come through, people must come and seek assistance so that we can detect early and help to prevent the spread and complications of the infection.” South Africa has recorded 7 458 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of cases to date to 1 011 871.
