Severe storm around Pampierstad in the Northern Cape has claimed two young lives and left hundreds homeless. Itireleng residents say they have never seen anything like this before. A very traumatising scene with a wall collapsing on four children, seeking cover. Two died instantly and the other two were rushed to hospital. A resident says, “It seems as if these kids were outside, trying to seek cover next to the wall. That’s why things turned out to be how they are.”

Modisaotsile Molale suffered a double blow as he received a call that the roof of his home had blown away by the storm. A few minutes later, his sister called to inform him about the tragedy that befell his niece. Molale says, “They called immediately after 10 minutes to say the wall collapsed on some children. It’s about two or three children, but some are in critical condition. So, my niece is one of them but he is very critical and then they dropped the call. Shortly, after 10 minutes again, my sister called me again to say the child had died.” The municipality is still assessing the damages. Phokwane Municipal Mayor Olebogeng Tumodi says, “We have engaged social development and disaster management to come do their survey to check how much will that process cost. All in all the houses are close to hundred.” The Phokwane Municipality and the Social Development Department have promised to assist the storm victims.

Residents are counting their losses and trying to rebuild where they can.
