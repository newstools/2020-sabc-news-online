The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has called on all South Africans, including those who have boundary demarcation disputes, to register for the forthcoming Local Government Elections when registration weekends are announced. The Municipal Demarcation Board handed over electoral wards for the 2021 elections to the IEC at the electoral body’s headquarters in Centurion on Tuesday. The milestone, which takes place every five years, allows for the beginning of preparations for the poll. Next year’s election will see 76 wards added to the existing ones bringing the total to 4 468. Wards are delimited every 5 years in metro & local municipalities for electoral purposes necessitated by changes in numbers of registered voters as a result of migration & new voters on voters’ roll. Thanks to @MunicipalBoard for this ward delimitation process flow. pic.twitter.com/mEHkxQ5xbF — IEC South Africa (@IECSouthAfrica) December 1, 2020  South Africa’s electoral system provides for the election of ward councillors. IEC Deputy Commissioner Masego Sheburi says: “So we appeal to communities that even if they are dissatisfied for one reason or another with the demarcated boundaries, they should still avail themselves of the opportunity to re-register in their correct voting stations, so that they safeguard their right to participate in the upcoming local government elections.” In the video below, Masego speaks on re-registration for the municipal elections:
