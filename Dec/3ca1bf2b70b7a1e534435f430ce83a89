Political analyst Mcebisi Ndletyana says nothing tangible is expected to come out of the ANC’s Integrity Commission after the party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule appears before it on Saturday. On Thursday, Magashule said the National Executive Committee (NEC) had resolved to give national leadership until January 2021 to finalise the guidelines for members implicated in corruption to step aside. Magashule is among members facing fraud and corruption allegations. In the video below, SABC News’ Samkele Maseko gives an update on Ace Magashule:  Magashule is out on bail of R200 000 for criminal charges relating to the multi-million rand asbestos project while he was Premier in the Free State. He will be back in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court in February 2021. Ndletyana says ANC members who are supposed to deal with corruption are themselves implicated in it. “Corruption in the ANC has been institutionalised and a lot of people are implicated. It has been going on for a while. So, even though they might talk about corruption, people are reluctant to act against it because if they do, they will also be punished. That’s what you have. Corruption is pretty much paralysing the organisation. I don’t know what the commission will come up with and in fact, the NEC might not act [on the findings of the Integrity Commission],” adds Ndletyana.
