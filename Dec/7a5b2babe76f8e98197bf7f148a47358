The Vereeniging Regional court in the Vaal has denied bail to a Gauteng woman accused of killing a female friend and a British man she had met on social media. The charred bodies of Jamnadas Nathvani and Lynette Mustapha were found months apart near Walkerville, south of Johannesburg. The court heard that the accused, Zaheeda Boomgaard, had tampered with the signature on the will of one of the deceased in an effort to benefit from assets worth R7.2 million. The court also heard that CCTV footage obtained from a local bank shows her withdrawing money from the bank account of one of the deceased. In a statement submitted to the court, the investigating officer reveals that Boomgaard allegedly went to the FNB bank with a copy of Mustapha’s will, that she had tampered with the signature in an attempt to access millions worth of assets. The officer says that Boomgaard’s description to the bank about how Mustapha’s body had been found and the state it had been in, was exactly what police had discovered in the open veld. The accused claims she was merely explaining what she had seen at the mortuary when she had to identify the body. In an affidavit, Boomgaard claims that she had a signed letter from the deceased authorising her to withdraw money. The investigating officer says that such a letter does indeed exist but that the signature had been tampered with. The case has been postponed to January 2021 for further investigation. Boomgaard will remain behind bars until then.
