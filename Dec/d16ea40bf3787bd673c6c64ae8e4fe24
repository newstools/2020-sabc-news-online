Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has issued a stern warning to people who drive under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the festive season.  He has been briefing the National Assembly on the 2020 festive season safety plan for roads and transport. Mbalula says the problem is pervasive and his department will be looking out for corrupt police and traffic officials who take bribes during this time. “The law enforcement authorities will heighten (the road and safety) operation through multi operations,  joint operations and strengthen the emphasis on fatigue management, reckless driving, intoxicated drivers, alcohol abuse and drugs, road rage and patrol vehicles to clamp down on distracted driving, dangerous overtaking and excessive speed. In a country that has seen a spike in the use of recreational drugs, this will constitute one of the focal areas during the festive season and beyond.   “ SAFER FESTIVE SEASON: LIVE BEYOND DEZEMBA Efforts to curb the scourge of fatalities on our roads requires a collaborative effort between government and civil society in order to tackle the key driver of this sorry state of affairs:lawlessness on our roads. #LiveBeyondDezemba pic.twitter.com/xizdwZoYzh — Minister of Transport |Mr Fix (@MbalulaFikile) December 1, 2020  He says there will be undercover sting operations focusing on corrupt police officials. “Last year, together with the Hawks, we arrested a lot of corrupt police officers and we will continue to do the same during this festive season. The time for bribes is over and the long arm of the law will find them. “ SAFER FESTIVE SEASON | LIVE BEYOND DEZEMBA Good morning South Africa, it’s the 1st of December and we’re officially at that time of the year on our roads.
