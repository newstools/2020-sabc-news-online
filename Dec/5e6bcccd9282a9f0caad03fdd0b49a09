Former President Jacob Zumaâ€™s corruption case has been postponed to February 23, 2021. There was a pre-trial hearing in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday morning. Zuma faces charges of racketeering, two counts of corruption, one count of money laundering, and 12 counts of fraud relating to 783 payments he allegedly received in connection with the controversial multi-billion-rand arms deal. In September, the Jacob Zuma Foundation released a statement criticising the National Prosecuting Authority for not being ready to proceed with its trial against the former President. This comes after the court proceeding did not take place. In June, Zuma and his co-accused, the French arms company Thales, appeared in court for the start of his pre-trial proceedings.  In April, Zuma terminated the services of his attorney in the Arms Deal corruption case against him. The firm of well-known attorney, Eric Mabuza, took over from Daniel Mantsha. In February, the High Court in Pietermaritzburg issued a warrant of arrest for Zuma for failing to appear in court. State Advocate Billy Downer said it is a criminal offence for an accused not to appear in court.
