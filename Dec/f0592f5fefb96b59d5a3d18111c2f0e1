The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will continue with its hearings on Thursday. The Commission will hear Estina Dairy Farm offshore money flows related evidence from a researcher employed by Shadow World Investigations, Paul Edward Holden. Live proceedings will be streamed below:   The multi-million rand Estina dairy project in Vrede in the Free State has been on the spotlight at the Commission on many occasions. It was established to benefit emerging farmers but the money to establish the farm landed in the hands of the Gupta family. In August, two former Transnet bodyguards took the stand. They told the Commission that some Transnet executives carried large sums of cash and frequented the Gupta compound. One of the bodyguards to former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe related how he once found a backpack belonging to Molefe filled with bundles of R200 notes. In October last year, former head of the Free State Agriculture Department Peter Thabethe was grilled at the Commission as he struggled to fully explain why he had allowed R29-million to be paid to an account of the dairy farm before a full feasibility study could be completed. He was also questioned about the department’s monitoring of the monies that were paid to the project including reasons for advancing the project the R29-million in June 2012.
