The Health Department has warned against perceptions that coronavirus vaccines are harmful, saying there is no guarantee that those who will opt not to be vaccinated will not contract the virus. A recent IPSOS survey found that less than two-thirds or 64% of South Africans would accept a COVID-19 vaccine when and if it became available. Of that 64% only 29% strongly agreed that the vaccine was necessary. This is lower than the average of 74% of about 20 000 adults surveyed in 27 countries who said they would agree to get a vaccine. The department’s Dr Anban Pillay says, “We would always protect the Constitutional right of individuals who choose not to have a vaccine. But having made their choice those individuals also need to protect the rights of other individuals who need to be protected in a work environment for example. So clearly, while I may have chosen not to take the vaccine, I cannot infringe on the rights of my colleagues and then spread the virus in the workplace as a result of not taking the vaccine. So those are some of the risks of taking a vaccine bring with it.” SA experts discuss COVID-19 vaccines   SA experts discuss COVID-19 vaccines  SAHPRA receives first application to register Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) says it has received its first application to register a COVID-19 vaccine from Johnson and Johnson.
