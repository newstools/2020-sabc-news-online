A United Nations security team seeking to visit a camp for Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia’s war-hit Tigray region was denied access and shot at, two diplomatic sources said on Monday. The incident occurred when the team tried to visit Shimelba, one of four settlements for Eritreans in the northern Tigray region, the sources told Reuters. They declined to give more details, saying the full circumstances were unclear. Neither Ethiopia’s government nor the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), who have been at war since Nov. 4, immediately responded to requests for comment. Information from Tigray has been hard to verify because communications have been largely down and access has been tightly controlled. There was no immediate comment from UN officials.
