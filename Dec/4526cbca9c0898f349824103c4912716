The five people accused of the murder of Prince Lethukuthula Zulu are expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s  Court, north of Johannesburg, on Monday morning. Zulu is the eldest son of King Goodwill Zwelithini. Security guards found his body at his Johannesburg home in Randburg on November 6. It’s alleged that the 50-year-old had been drugged and his belongings stolen. Tshegofatso Moremane, Margaret Koaile, Portia Mnola, Gontse Tlhoele and Dakalo Mbedzi were arrested in connection with the murder. They’re suspected of running a syndicate that drugs and robs people. During their previous appearance, one of the suspects told the court that she had sexually entertained the Prince at his home and that she had suspected he was consuming drugs after noticing a white powder-like substance around his mouth. The accused allegedly stole a microwave, television sets and cash, valued at an estimated R30 000 from Zulu’s apartment. Zulu was born in 1970 to King Goodwill Zwelithini and his first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini. He completed his lower education at Mlokothwa High school and furthered his tertiary education at the Durban University of Technology and Mangosuthu University of Technology. His death shocked the Zulu nation. As the eldest son to the King, Prince Lethukuthula has been described as a pillar of strength to the Zulu royal family. Prince Thulani Zulu, the Zulu Royal Household spokesperson said, “Prince Lethukuthula was a humble person, following his name and a man of good character, soft-spoken, very humble and respective and also respectful to others and we will miss him a lot and he was a pride of the family.”
