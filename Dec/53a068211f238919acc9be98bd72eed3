Head of South Africa’s Ministerial Advisory Committee on coronavirus vaccine development, Professor Barry Schoub, has cautioned that vaccines are not an immediate miracle cure. As the country experiences a second wave of rising infections, exacerbated by a new variant of the virus, there has been criticism over why a vaccine will only be available in South Africa during the second quarter of next year. Schoub says it will be sometime before South Africans develop immunity to the virus. “Once the vaccines arrive on our doorstep that’s not the end, it’s not going to switch of the epidemic, those first tranches will go to protect healthcare workers almost no effect on the population as such then there’s go to be the immunisation of the population universal immunisiation thats gonna take a long time, it’s gonna take months and months before we try and achieve herd immunity. “ “So it’s not that because we don’t have a vaccine we still got the epidemic. Look at the UK where they are rolling out very extensively, they having a very severe epidemic it has not switched off the epidemic by any means.” In the video below, Professor Barry Schoub took part in a discussion on Thursday morning: INFOGRAPHIC: COVID-19 Statistics in SA: COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 194 ﻿363 169 ﻿363 24 ﻿106 36 ﻿159 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 30 ﻿DECEMBER 2020 7 259 556 640 DEATHS 2163 6689 5465 4134 577 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 039 161 DEATHS | 28 033 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 553 761 RECOVERIES | 867 597 379 86163 282 ﻿642 39 531 25164 205 ﻿280  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 62 ﻿287 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
