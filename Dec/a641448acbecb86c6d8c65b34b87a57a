These include regular wearing of masks, social distancing, hand washing, and avoiding poorly ventilated areas. Liquor store shoppers we spoke to say they do not want to be left disappointed. “We don’t understand whether he’s going to close or not, because the Minister of Police said he must close,” says one of the shoppers. Another one says, “I am here to buy my booze because I think probably on Thursday I won’t get any alcohol because the president will close.” Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize has warned that further restrictions are needed to curb the spread of the virus. “Now that the numbers are increasing, it is going to be important for us to make sure there are further restrictions. We have to talk about restrictions in terms of gatherings and risk areas that we have seen, people behaving in a manner that created congestion and easy spread of the infection. I cannot make any speculation on levels, but I do believe that we need some ways of strengthening the containment measures.”
