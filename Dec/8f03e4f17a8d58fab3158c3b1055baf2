Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga says the year 2020 will be recorded in history as the most difficult year for the world. This is due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 virus and the effect it had on the education system. During the media briefing on Thursday morning in Pretoria, Motshekga says the matric group of 2020 lost 47 schooling days, but showed appreciation to many various interventions which assisted learners to finish the year’s curriculum – programmes like WOZA Matric programmes helped learners with home time learning. Due to the novel coronavirus, lives were unfortunately lost  – with the country having lost 1 493 teachers, she says. “We lost workers in schools and officials in circuits, district offices, provincial departments, and who can forget that we also lost MEC of Education in the Northern Cape, Mack Jack, may their souls rest in eternal peace.” School readiness for 2021 The Minister reassured that the sector is ready for the 2021 academic year as schools reopen on January 25 for teachers and learners only expected on January 27.
