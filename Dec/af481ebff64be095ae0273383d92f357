A truck driver is expected to appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court in Gauteng east of Johannesburg on Tuesday after being arrested for allegedly being 12 times over the legal alcohol limit. Gauteng Traffic Police spokesperson Sello Maremane says the man was spotted driving recklessly on the road. He subsequently lost control of the vehicle and crashed into several other vehicles on the R21 next to Pomona off-ramp yesterday. Maremane says law enforcement authorities will be harsh on those breaking the rules of the road. He says, “We condemn this kind of irresponsible and reckless behavior by some of our drivers. We will not rest until ruthless and lawless behavior is eradicated on our roads. We would also like to issue a stern warning against any driver driving a vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor that they will be charged and arrested.” Yesterday Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula released the 2020 Preliminary Festive Season Fatalities Statistics.
