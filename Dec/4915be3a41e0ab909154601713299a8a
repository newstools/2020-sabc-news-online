Power utility, Eskom, has announced that it will move down to stage one load shedding on Sunday. This follows the recovery in emergency generation reserves. The country is currently on Stage 2 load shedding, following an announcement from the power utility on Friday. “As the recovery in the emergency generation reserves has showed significant progress, load shedding will be reduced to Stage 1 from 06:00 until 23:00 tomorrow. It is necessary to continue with load shedding in order to fully recover the emergency generation reserves in preparation for the coming week. Eskom will communicate timeously should there be any significant changes to the power system,” says Eskom Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha. #PowerAlert 1 Eskom to reduce loadshedding to Stage 1 starting at 06:00 tomorrow until 23:00@News24 @SABCNews @NewzroomAfrika @eNCA @IOL @ewnupdates @SundayTimesZA @SowetanLIVE pic.twitter.com/7XDh3ARu5P — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) December 12, 2020  Some South Africans have been having a field day on Twitter over the return of power cuts. #Loadshedding
