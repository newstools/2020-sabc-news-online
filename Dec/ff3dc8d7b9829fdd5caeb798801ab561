The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has voiced concerns over the manner in which party members have been arrested in the past, saying the process risks delegitimising the state’s capability in its handling of prosecution. This after the ANC’s Integrity Commission in the province gave Zandile Gumede the green light to return to her positions, both in the ANC and the provincial legislature. Gumede was asked to step aside after she was arrested in connection with the alleged fraud and corruption in the awarding of waste removal tender. The ANC’s Secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Mdumiseni Ntuli, says: “There are quite a number of comrades in the province, including Gumede, that, in our own view, have not been treated in a manner that is dignified. Comrade Gumede is just one of the incidents. Others have been arrested, kept in custody for a month, two months, 6 months and later on they get told that their charges have been drawn or there are no charges as we are still investigating. So, it is a practice that comrades are subjected to which we are very concerned about because it delegitimises the state’s capability in terms of how it handles its matters of prosecution.” Below is the SAFM Sunrise interview with Ntuli:
