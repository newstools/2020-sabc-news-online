Deputy President David Mabuza says South Africans should not let down their guards against coronavirus as they celebrate the festive season. Officials have expressed concerns over the rapid manner in which a new variant of the coronavirus transfers among people. More than 14 000 cases have been reported in the past 24-hours, the country’s highest recorded infections since the start of the pandemic. At least 411 people have died from COVID-19-related illnesses during the latest reporting period, bringing the total number of fatalities to 25 657. Mabuza has addressed the nation ahead of Christmas Day. “While significantly, progress has been made in containing the spread of infection during the first phase of the pandemic, the current resurgence and rise in infection continue to demand our collective commitment and adherence to all the COVID-19 protocols and regulations. We cannot afford as a nation to be complacent and let our guard down during this difficult period in our lives. As we celebrate Xmas with our families and friends we must at all times adhere to COVID-19 regulations.” Deputy President David Mabuza’s Christmas message to South Africans:  Second wave The Deputy President has also hailed the bravery of frontline workers as the battle to control the spread of the virus continues. The rate of coronavirus infections and COVID 19 deaths across the country is expected to continue to increase as the second wave is hitting harder than the first. Around 10 000 new cases and well over 100 deaths are now being reported every day. The government has urged people to continue wearing masks, practice social distancing and regular handwashing to protect themselves and their loved ones from the potentially deadly disease.
