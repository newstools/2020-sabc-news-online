 A gathering aimed to reflect on the role of the National Economic Development Labour Council (Nedlac). In its 25-years of existence, Nedlac had succeeded in bringing government, business, labour and civil society under one roof, but the Forum still remains largely divided on ideologies. There’s been progress, but a lot could be achieved. In the face of the country’s worsening socio-economic challenges, the partners are failing to agree on the economic recovery plan that is needed urgently. Civil society has accused other partners of excluding communities in some of their discussions.  The widening trust deficit between government, labour and business demands full support of the structural interventions and enablers contained in the economic reconstruction and recovery plan. — David D Mabuza (@DDMabuza) December 8, 2020  Mabuza says the high debt and liquidity problems facing Eskom warrants extraordinary intervention.  He says the government is fully behind the management of Eskom. The compact sets out steps that government, business and labour should commit to in supporting the struggling Eskom. Mabuza explains, “Compromise and trade-offs are central and not the pursuit of a zero-sum game where no one comes out a winner communication is a key tool to employ to get buy-in from communities. Hence, part of the Eskom social compact is about the revival of the campaign to encourage people to pay for basic municipal services.” https://t.co/AMZa7KmmMX — David D Mabuza (@DDMabuza) December 8, 2020
