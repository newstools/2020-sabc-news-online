Condolences are pouring in following the death of a grandmother turned popular musician Gee-Six-Five from Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Nkosingiphile Selepe died in the early hours of Wednesday morning after testing positive for COVID-19. Gee-Six-Five had been in self-isolation after she tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday. The 65-years-old grandmother became famous with her hit song Obani Lababantu which was trending on both social media and online music stores. She composed and released the hit song after retiring from her teaching career. My beloved aunt, MumNcane who many of you know as #GeeSixFive is no more. She displayed leadership throughout her life, was the epitome of fearlessness & inspired many with her single #ObaniLababantu.
