The Eastern Cape Liquor Board has raised major concerns about the high number of cases of non-compliance by liquor outlets with regard to COVID-19 health protocols, especially as the province grapples with the rapid resurgence of the pandemic. The liquor board has opted to intensify its efforts to enforce compliance with COVID-19 restrictions and liquor licenses. The board will also embark on regular visits to liquor outlets to clamp down on those that do not comply with regulations. The Eastern Cape has surpassed the 8 000 mark for positive reported cases. Nelson Mandela Bay Last week,  the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro was declared a coronavirus hotspot. Addressing the nation President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 10 pm and 4 am curfew in the metro. “The curfew will be from 10 pm to 4 am. This does not apply to essential workers. The sale of alcohol from retail outlets will only be permitted between 10 am and 6 pm from Monday to Thursday. Alcohol consumption in public spaces such as beaches and parks is strictly forbidden. Gatherings including religious gatherings may not be attended by more than 100 people for indoor and 250 for outdoor events. And finally, all post-funeral gatherings are prohibited.” Nelson Mandela Bay declared a hotspot:  Minister Zweli Mkhize visited the province, meeting different stakeholders to find ways to reduce the number of cases. Mkhize said the cases are alarming and called for quick intervention. “The Nelson Mandela Bay has continued to be clustered. Our concern is that something needs to be done in finding ways to reduce numbers. We have seen numbers increase in NMB (Nelson Mandela Bay) and EC (Eastern Cape), the number of hospitalised people, and those who have lost their lives.”
