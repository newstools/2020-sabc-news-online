The African National Congress (ANC) has decided to cancel all its 109th birthday celebrations countrywide. This follows fears of the proliferation of coronavirus infections. ANC officials were briefed by Health Minister, Dr. Zweli Mkhize where he raised his concerns about the rapid rise of COVID-19 infections as the country is experiencing a second wave. “Please be advised that the national officials received a briefing this morning from Cde Zwelini Mkhize, and are concerned with the rapid proliferation of infections countrywide, the prognosis is not good,” says the ANC in a statement. The governing party was to hold its virtual celebrations in Polokwane on the 8th of January. Instead of holding massive rallies, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa will read out the statement virtually. Last week the ruling party announced that only a limited number was allowed to attend the celebrations. But following Monday morning’s meeting, the party decided to cancel all celebrations. The NEC will meet on the 6th of January to finalise the Statement. Celebrations will be held in Limpopo on January 8 2022.
