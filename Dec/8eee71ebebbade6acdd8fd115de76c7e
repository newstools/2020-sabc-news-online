While commending South Africans who complied with government’s call for them to stay away from beaches, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize also defended strict regulations in hotspot areas. “We also note the various legal challenges that have been brought against government regarding recent regulations. As Health, we stand by the recommendations made to the NCCC, which are well substantiated by evidence. We have every intention to oppose these applications as the Department and Government’s mandate to protect the lives and health of our people remains paramount. We dare not neglect this responsibility by omitting to take the necessary actions to protect the health care system from being overwhelmed and collapsing as we’ve seen in other countries,” he says.  The Democratic Alliance (DA) is not pleased with government’s strict COVID-19 rules in the Garden Route. On Thursday, it lodged court papers opposing the closure of the Garden Route beaches. The opposition party believes the closure will lead to more job losses in the country. SA experts discuss COVID-19 vaccines:
