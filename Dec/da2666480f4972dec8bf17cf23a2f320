Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, has acknowledged that further restrictions need to be enforced to help slow the spread of the second wave of coronavirus.  The country has recorded more than a million cases. More than 26 000 people have died from COVID-19. A new and more contagious variant of coronavirus is believed to be driving the second wave. An explanation on what the new variant is:  The National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) has met to discuss options to curb the further spread of infections. Mkhize says restrictions should be placed on hotspot areas. “Now that the numbers are increasing, it is going to be important for us to make sure there are further restrictions. We have to talk about restrictions in terms of gatherings and risk areas that we have seen people behaving in a manner that created congestion and easy spread of the infection. I cannot make any speculation on levels, but I do believe that we need some ways of strengthening the containment measures.” The latest coronavirus stats in SA:  COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 183653 166849 22705 34920 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 27 DECEMBER 2020 6925 543 638 DEATHS 2152 6218 5334 3971 577 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 004 413 DEATHS | 26 735 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 445 318 RECOVERIES | 844 874 377 86163 274272 38540 24870 196833  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 61771 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Some of the districts that have been declared hotspots include Nelson Mandela Bay, Garden Route, and  Sarah Bartman.
