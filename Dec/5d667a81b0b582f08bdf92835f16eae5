Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini -Zuma said South Africa’s Ambassador to Senegal Lenin Shope was a true soldier of the African National Congress (ANC) uMkhonto weSizwe. Dlamini-Zuma was speaking on behalf of ANC at Ambassador Shope’s funeral service at Marks Parks Sports Club in Johannesburg. Ambassador Shope passed away at his official residence in Dakar, Senegal, earlier this week.

Dlamini-Zuma said Ambassador Shope served graciously. “The fact that we lay to rest your father on this day of Mkhonto weSizwe, also confirms that comrade Lenin lived his life in struggle and service. He was a proud cadre and proud of his rich history and environment and there’s much to learn on his life.” Today, Friday 11 December 2020, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation hosted a memorial for the late Ambassador Lenin Shope.
