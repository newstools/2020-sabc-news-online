Gauteng Premier David Makhura has announced that Dr. Nomathemba Mokgethi is the new health MEC. She is the former Social Development MEC. The position became vacant following the removal of Dr. Bandile Masuku, after his alleged involvement in corruption related to a tender to procure Person Protective Equipment. Makhura also appointed former Johannesburg Mayor Parks Tau as the MEC for Economic Development, Agriculture and Environment. Morakane Mosupyoe moves from Economic Development to Social Development. Having assessed the strengths of the current serving MEC’s I have decided to make the following changes: Dr Thembi Mokgethi is the new MEC for Health. She is not new to the sector & her knowledge, experience & qualifications make her a strong candidate to lead the portfolio. pic.twitter.com/q6IXfMt7YJ — David Makhura (@David_Makhura) December 2, 2020  The new MEC for @gpgSocDev is @Morakane_.
