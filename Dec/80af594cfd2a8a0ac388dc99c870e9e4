Gauteng Premier David Makhura has defended his cabinet reshuffle earlier this week. He appointed Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi as Health MEC. Other prominent appointments include Parks Tau, who will be the MEC for Economic Development and Morakane Mosupyoe as the new MEC for Social Development. Makhura’s new appointments have ruffled the feathers of the African National Congress (ANC) Youth League, particularly that of Tau. The league says it wants a young person to take over. In conversation with newly-appointed Gauteng MEC of Health, Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi:  Makhura has emphasised that no one will be forced to resign to make way for others. “We will have Parks Tau as an MEC sworn in in the coming week. But the Secretary will tell you who is going to be redeployed. It’s not resigning it’s being redeployed. When the ANC assigns people responsibilities we do so informed by the priorities. To get the economy working the way it should and we have to get amongst the most experienced people to do that work. And that’s what has informed the ANC leadership in Gauteng province,” says Makhura. Having assessed the strengths of the current serving MEC’s I have decided to make the following changes: Dr Thembi Mokgethi is the new MEC for Health. She is not new to the sector & her knowledge, experience & qualifications make her a strong candidate to lead the portfolio. pic.twitter.com/q6IXfMt7YJ — David Makhura (@David_Makhura) December 2, 2020
