The Eastern Cape government is calling on citizens to be extra cautious as the province is grappling with an increasing number of COVID-19 hotspots areas. On Monday night, President Ramaphosa declared Chris Hani District, Buffalo City, Amathole District, Alfred Nzo District and the OR Tambo District as hotspot areas in addition to the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro and the Sarah Baartman District, which have already been declared hotspots. In the video below, President Ramaphosa addresses the nation:  To date, the province has recorded over 7000 deaths and more than 160 000 infections. Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, spokesperson for Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane, says the increase in infections is due to non-compliance to safety regulations. “The infection is spreading because some of our people have lowered their guard. All gatherings have been put on hold. We expect everyone to comply with that decision. We appreciate the fact that Ulwaluko has been closed except for those initiates that are already in.” “They will be assisted to complete the process. Anyone who wants to go through Ulwaluko will have to wait until it’s open again. We appeal to our people to take heed of these decisions because they are here to protect you from being infected,” explains Sicwetsha.
