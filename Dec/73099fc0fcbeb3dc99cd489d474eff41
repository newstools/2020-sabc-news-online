Political Analyst Lukhona Mnguni has described the latest developments in the Gauteng cabinet as an indication that Premier David Makhura is losing his political power. Mnguni says Makhura appears to be under pressure to make certain decisions. On Wednesday, Makhura reshuffled his cabinet and included the appointment of the new Health MEC Doctor Nomathemba Mokgethi, with Parks Tau set to take over Mokgethi’s Social Development portfolio. Mnguni says, “Premier Makhura lost in fact in this battle, because he was to take a wait and see approach but the political structures forced him after a PEC meeting two months ago telling him they needed stability. Some were telling him not to drag his feet in terms of implementing resolutions of the PEC from two months ago.” “It hasn’t been an easy moment for him and I think you don’t also want to lead a government that has so many changes, I mean this is now the second forced change that he’s facing, ” says Mnguni. ANC Youth League’s provincial spokesperson, Nkosazana Mtolo says their members won’t resign to make way for former Johannesburg Mayor Parks Tau who has been drafted into the new provincial cabinet.
