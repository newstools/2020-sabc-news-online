NUMSA spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi- Majola says Sipunzi strongly believed in the unity of the working class. “Comrade Sipunzi believed very strongly in the unity of the working class. We worked with NUM when workers at Eskom were negotiating wages in 2018 and together we also marched to the Union Buildings and fought side by side to oppose the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers and the unbundling of the SOE. His untimely passing is a blow to the working class. We stand in solidarity with members of the NUM in mourning him.” NUM GS David Kolekile Sipunzi passes away:
