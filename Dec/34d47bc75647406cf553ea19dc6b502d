 NGOs in the area have made appeals for food, clothing, baby nappies and formula. It’s a race against time to clear the area. The city says site clearing is expected to continue well into next week. It says all those, who have been affected, have been verified with special assistance given to medically vulnerable people.  Media Officer for Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato, Lyndon Khan, says the declaration of a local disaster has now been formalised. Many affected residents have sought shelter from friends and family. The public has also responded generously in donating warm meals, goods and other resources. Humanitarian organisation, Gift of the Givers representative Ricardo Sedres says they have two pieces of clothing for every person. “We literally have mountains of clothing and bedding and blankets and food. However, for 4 000 people who are homeless. 1 052 shacks is the official count its not nearly enough. We probably got enough for 2 pieces of clothing for every person.” However, with over 4 000 people in need, relief agencies have appealed for more donations.
