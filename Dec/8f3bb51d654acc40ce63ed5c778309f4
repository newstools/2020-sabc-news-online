The African National Congress (ANC) Integrity Commission has finally met with President Cyril Ramaphosa. The Commission requested a meeting with the President in 2018 when the issue of BOSASA and his CR17 Campaign funds were raised. However, the commission said it was disappointing that it did not deal extensively with the matter, as President Ramaphosa said it is still before courts.  The Commission however, instructed anyone with undisputed evidence of vote-buying at the ANC 2017 elective conference, which elected Ramaphosa as party president, to urgently take the matter to the Disciplinary Committee. Ramaphosa is the second high level ANC official to appear before the Integrity Commission after the party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule last week. The Integrity Commission instructed Magashule to step aside following his corruption case relating to the multi-million rand asbestos project while he was premier in the Free State. Full report: In November the motion of no confidence filed against President Cyril Ramaphosa was postponed to February 2021. This comes after the African Transformation Movement’s (ATM) Vuyo Zungula wrote to the National Speaker Thandi Modise, to request that the motion of no confidence against President Cyril Ramaphosa, be postponed to 2021.
