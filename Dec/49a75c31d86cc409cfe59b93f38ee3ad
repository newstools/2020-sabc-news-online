Former Eskom Board Chairperson Ben Ngubane says former Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown is alleged to have suggested Brian Molefe’s name to act as Eskom Group CEO. Testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg, Ngubane says this happened after the suspension of the power utility’s former CEO Tshediso Matona and three other executives in 2015. He has denied allegations that he and the Transnet Board discreetly negotiated the transfer of Anoj Singh and Brian Molefe to Eskom in 2015. Ngubane says, “We had written to the Transnet Board, they had agreed, so we were just crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. It wasn’t the original start of that request. Of course, being Chairman it was in my office and I introduced the subject of the secondment of Mr Molefe not that I was initiating that process.” The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture proceedings: On Tuesday, Eskom company secretary for legal and compliance head Suzanne Daniels accused the Commission of being more lenient with her former bosses than her in its line of questioning. In September, Daniels told the Commission that Gupta associate Salim Essa had offered her R800-million to reinstate Eskom’s former acting CEO Matshela Koko. Last week, Koko denied allegations that he gave his daughter a billion rands worth of Eskom contracts. Koko gives evidence before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture:
