A Hammanskraal businessman is expected to appear in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on allegations of fraud and bribery in connection with the Department of Labour’s UIF COVID-19 relief fund amounting to R110 million. He apparently claimed to have terminated more than 6 000 employees from their employment during lockdown. However, his company did not have any employees other than himself. The businessman allegedly fraudulently used people’s IDs to claim UIF and relief benefits without their knowledge. The company was paid more than R110 million based on the fraudulent claims. The businessman’s bank accounts had been frozen by the Assets Forfeiture Unit (AFU). Meanwhile in October, a director of a company arrested by the Hawks for allegedly defrauding the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) relief fund of more than R3 million appeared in the Malamulele Magistrate’s Court. Dorris Mashimbye allegedly claimed funds on behalf of 242 former Expanded Public Works Programme workers, but never paid the money over to them.
