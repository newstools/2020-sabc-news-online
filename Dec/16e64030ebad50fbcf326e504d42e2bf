Judgment in the Constitutional Court application for former President Jacob Zuma to comply with the summons directing him to appear before the State Capture Commission has been reserved. On Tuesday, the highest court in the land heard an urgent application by the secretary of the commission to have Zuma appear before the Zondo Commission in January and February next year. Last month, Zuma walked out of the commission without the presiding officer Justice Raymond Zondo’s permission:  The application also sought an order declaring Zuma’s walkout unlawful and in breach of the commission’s Act. Sticking to his guns, the former president did not show up at the Constitutional Court either to respond or oppose arguments by the commission’s legal team. Earlier this month, through his lawyers, Zuma said he will not participate in the commission’s Constitutional Court bid. The commission’s legal representative advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi described Zuma’s refusal to appear before the commission as belligerent and defiant. But with the end of the commission’s lifespan fast approaching, Ngcukaitobi found himself having to overcome a number of hurdles convincing the Apex court that their application should be heard on an urgent basis. But justices Mbuyiseli Madlanga and Steven Mathopo seemed not convinced by Ngcukaitobi’s reasons for the commission to directly approach the Constitutional Court.
