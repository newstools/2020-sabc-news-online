Ntuzuma Magistrates Court, north of Durban, is packed to capacity to hear closing arguments in the murder case of Khulukazi Ndlovu. Ndlovu was killed in April this year and her body burnt to ashes inside her car. It was discovered at the Molweni cemetery north of Durban. Ndlovu’s estranged husband, Sifiso Professor Ndlovu, has been arrested for her murder. On Wednesday, the defence called a witness that agreed to offer Ndlovu shelter should he be granted bail. The victim’s family is also in court, saying they are in disbelief over those who have arrived to support the accused. The victim’s family waited for months for DNA confirmation that the remains found in the badly burnt car belonged to the deceased.
