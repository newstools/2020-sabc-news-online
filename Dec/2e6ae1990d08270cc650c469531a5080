The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro and the Sarah Baartman Municipality, which are among the coronavirus hotspots in the Eastern Cape, have recorded a decline in infections. The provincial Health Department says this is due to the rapid testing programme and awareness campaigns. However, the infection rate is climbing in other parts of the province including the OR Tambo, Alfred Nzo and Joe Gqabi districts. The province has just more than 13 000 active cases. The department’s spokesperson Siyanda Manana says they are now focusing on the areas in which the infection rate is rising. “We are adopting the same approach as in the metro, the metro peaked a little bit earlier and that was also the case in the first wave as well, so in this instance, because we had an integrated approach where you had different departments coming together, your police enforcing adherence protocols. We had the liquor board coming on board and municipalities in the respective areas, so that approach we are going to export other districts as well, it is an approach that we’ve seen bearing fruits in the metro as well as Sarah Baartman.” Only the Eastern Cape reported a decrease in their new cases, according to the Health Department’s latest report. The details are as follows:
Increase in WC (from 2 785 yesterday to 3 233 today)
Increase in KZN (from 1 152 yesterday to 2 743 today)
