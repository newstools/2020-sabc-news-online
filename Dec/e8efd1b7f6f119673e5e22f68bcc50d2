Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor, Nqaba Bhanga, has announced an inclusive Mayoral Committee. All the parties that brought Bhanga to power with the exception of the Patriotic Alliance are part of the Mayoral Committee. The Democratic Alliance (DA), Congress of the People (Cope), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), United Front and the African Independent Congress have signed a coalition agreement. Bhanga says their priority is to bring services back to the citizens of Nelson Mandela Bay “It should be a team of people that is going to compliment what I will be doing and I think we have put a team of strong people  who will be able to deliver services to our people.” “There were compromises there and there others that wanted certain positions but we compromised, and accepted that they will not get everything.” Earlier this month Bhanga said Eastern Cape Cogta MEC Xolile Nqatha does not have powers to declare his election as Mayor null and void. Nqaba Bhanga rejects COGTA MEC’s letter declaring his election as NMB mayor unlawful:  Bhanga was elected during a protracted council meeting on Friday, where Patriotic Alliance councillor Marlon Daniels presided over the election, after Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya was allegedly kidnapped by unknown men during the council meeting. Bhanga says, “The Executive Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay is Nqaba Bhanga, they must just drink it and love it. Because he’s going to be here, Nqaba Bhanga is here in the City Hall, Nqaba Bhanga is running the city as an Executive Mayor…” The Eastern Cape has seen a dramatic spike in COVID-19 cases over the past few weeks. The declaration of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro as a hotspot by President Cyril Ramaphosa was prompted by rising numbers of infections and communities that reportedly ignored the restrictions.
