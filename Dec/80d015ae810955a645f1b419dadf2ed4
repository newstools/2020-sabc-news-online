Police Minister Bheki Cele has visited the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro to assess the strength of its safety plan for the festive season amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Minister visited some taverns in the Bay, as well as the roadblock on the N2, near Motherwell. Cele commended the Friendly City for its low numbers of murder and crime, but maintains that its citizens need to obey the rules and regulations of the lockdown. He has urged them to stop hurting women and children. The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro is a hotspot for COVID-19. Alcohol and large gatherings have been a major contributor to the spread of the virus. Cele also visited the Gqalane Tavern in KwaZakhele. He spoke to the owner regarding an incident that happened last week, where police opened fire on patrons when they refused to observe lockdown regulations. Patrons, in turn, threw bottles at the police. Cele says people need to take responsibility for their own actions otherwise the police will use the full might of the law. Minister says he is worried about the compliance of regulations in taverns:  The Minister also stressed the importance of police in acting promptly in attending to cases of femicide. “She comes the first time, you send her home. She comes the second time, you send her home. She doesn’t come a third time because she is dead. I am appealing to all my police to protect the women, protect the children, and protect the elderly. In the constitution, your job is to protect, combat, investigate, and protect all the inhabitants of the country. You must know you have an extra job when it comes to protecting women’s issues.” Metro Police say compliance at roadblocks has been very good. Road users, including taxis, believe that adhering to the rules is of the utmost importance. Cele is very happy with this. Overall, the Minister is satisfied with the joint efforts of the mayor, metro police, emergency, and tactical units to ensure everyone’s safety.
