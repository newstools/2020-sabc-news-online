President Cyril Ramaphosa says the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has united the nation in the strongest way since the struggle for democracy. He was delivering his address to the nation on this Reconciliation Day. The theme of this year’s celebrations is – ‘United in action against racism, gender-based violence, and other intolerances’. Ramaphosa says as government forges ahead to rebuild the country’s economy South Africans must stand to remain resilient towards the goal of enhancing social cohesion. Earlier, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said as the country marks National Reconciliation Day, South Africans should ensure that they honour those who suffered for their freedom. The day has been observed on December the 16th since 1994. The aim is to foster reconciliation among races. This year’s theme is United in action against racism, gender-based violence (GBV), and other intolerances. Mthethwa says the theme talks to the realities South Africans are facing such as a lack of economic justice. “You can’t talk of reconciliation in the abstract. It has to be based on real issues, lived experiences of people so that when we put on the table gender-based violence, racism, and other intolerances, says to you, let’s look at this and not be cosy about it and not pretend that this is how things are when they are not. Reconciliation is about economic justice.”
