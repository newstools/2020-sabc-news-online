Former Namibian President Sam Nujoma has been hospitalised after testing positive for the coronavirus. The 91-year-old is said to be in stable condition and receiving treatment in hospital. He was admitted on Sunday and is apparently already showing signs of improvement. President Hage Geingob says Namibians and the rest of the world should not worry as there isn’t any cause for concern. He says regular updates on Nujoma’s condition will be released until his recovery.
