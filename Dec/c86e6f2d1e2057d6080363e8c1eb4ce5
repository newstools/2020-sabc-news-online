Gauteng police have arrested eleven suspects, including two police officers, following an attempted robbery at a diamond outlet in Bryanston, north of Johannesburg. Three unlicensed firearms were seized. A police team identified three vehicles driving towards the outlet, one of which was a marked police bakkie. The suspects got out of the vehicles and as the police approached the suspects started shooting at officers. Police Spokesperson Brenda Muridili says the suspects will appear at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. “The suspects will be appearing in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, facing charges of conspiracy to commit robbery, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, possession of suspected stolen vehicles and a driving vehicle without the owner’s consent.”
