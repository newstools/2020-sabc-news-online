Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 2 load shedding from Saturday. The power utility says it will do this from 6am until 11pm and will repeat the schedule on Sunday. Eskom says it has had a number of unplanned breakdowns. “This load shedding has been caused by the shortage of capacity due to high breakdown rates in addition to the 7-thousand-500 megawatts of capacity that is out on planned maintenance. This load shedding is necessary in order to replenish the emergency generation reserves during the weekend in order to better prepare for the week,” says  Eskom Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha. The power utility is again urging customers to reduce electricity consumption. #PowerAlert 2 Eskom to implement Stage 2 loadshedding starting at 06:00 tomorrow until 23:00, which will
