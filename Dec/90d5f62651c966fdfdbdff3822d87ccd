Humanitarian organisation, Gift of the Givers, says it will be making more high flow oxygen machines available to hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Gift of the Givers founder, Doctor Imtiaz Sooliman, says with these machines a huge amount of oxygen can be given to patients. It has a higher success rate against coronavirus than conventional ventilators. Sooliman says they are using their current supply of high flow oxygen machines, while awaiting the delivery of more machines in the New Year. “And the feedback we’re getting right now, in the last four to five days, is that these machines are life-saving. The high flow,  if you only have two machines like this in the world, they will feed the entire supply of oxygen in the world. Depending on how critical that patient is, the success rate of ventilators is not so good. So far, studies have shown that only 12% of people survive on ventilators but on the high flow machine stats nationwide show that the success rate is much better.” Sooliman says the high flow oxygen machines have been distributed to hospitals in Durban and Pietermaritzburg. “We’ve already started putting them in KZN. We’ve put them in Wentworth Hospital, Prince Mshiyeni, Edendale, Mahatma Gandhi, and Luthuli, and later this week or early next week we will roll out more machines in KZN.” The latest coronavirus stats in SA: COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 183653 166849 22705 34920 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 27 DECEMBER 2020 6925 543 638 DEATHS 2152 6218 5334 3971 577 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 004 413 DEATHS | 26 735 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 445 318 RECOVERIES | 844 874 377 86163 274272 38540 24870 196833  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 61771 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
