South Africa has registered a further 7 999 new coronavirus (COVID-19) bringing the cumulative number of cases to 860 964. This comes as the country expects President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the nation on Monday on the country’s response to the increasing numbers of infections, with many expecting stricter regulations as the country deals with the second wave. According the statement released by the Department of Health on Sunday evening, 170 more COVID-19 related deaths have been reported, with the Eastern Cape recording the most number of fatalities at 94. “Free State 11; Gauteng 3; Kwa-Zulu Natal 4; Northern Cape 4, and Western Cape 54. This brings the total deaths to 23 276.”   The last time President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to the nation he laid down the law for hotspot provinces, including Gauteng and the Western Cape. The World Health Organisation says this second wave of infections needs more attention from Africa. But the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says a second wave is not unique. African countries gearing themselves up to receive the much anticipated Covid-19 vaccine:  Monday’s address by President Ramaphosa follows a meeting with the country’s National Corona Command Council and government officials this weekend. Meanwhile, the MEC for Health in the Eastern Cape Sindiswa Gomba has tested positive for COVID-19. She is in self isolation. The MEC is subjecting herself to contact tracing so they can locate everyone she came into contact with. She is asymptomatic and will be working from home.
