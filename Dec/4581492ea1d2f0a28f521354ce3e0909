The City of Cape Town has launched its first public electric vehicle (EV) charging station, at the Bellville Civic Centre. This is the first of two solar-powered EV charging stations that will be offered free-of-charge for the first two years to members of the public. The other charging station will be located in Somerset West. The chargers were donated to the City by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. Mayoral Committee Member for Energy and Climate Change, Phindile Maxiti, says the sites were chosen because of their convenient, safe and visible locations. He says eMobility offers an opportunity to create a healthier, more inclusive city. “We are installing these chargers to actually promote the uptake of the EVs in the City of Cape Town, because we believe it is the right thing to do, because with the number of EVs that are coming across to the City, by doing that we will actually be providing clean air to our residents. Remember, these cars are not emitting anything so for us to make that we decrease on air pollution, it is very important that we promote the use of the EVS,” says Maxiti.
