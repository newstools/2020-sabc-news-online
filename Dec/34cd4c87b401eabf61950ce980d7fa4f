The murder trial of Limpopo businessman Rameez Patel resumes in the Polokwane High Court, after it was postponed yesterday. Defense lawyer, Meshack Thipe requested the postponement while he awaits his COVID-19 test results. Patel is facing a charge of murder after his first wife, Fatima, was found in a pool of blood at their family home in 2015. The state prosecutor was advised to watch out for any coronavirus symptoms. Patel has also been charged with the 2017 murder of his mother. During a bail hearing in 2018, Prosecutor Mashudu Mudau said Patel’s mother’s murder was a result of a family feud. Mudau said evidence showed that the accused had differences with his mother and they had not been speaking for two months before her death. He was also allegedly placed at the scene of the crime and is accused of paying a hit man. The accused had pointed a finger at his brother Razeem, but the state said there was no proof of this.
