Chairperson of the State Capture Commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has allocated a new set of dates to allow former President Jacob Zuma to appear and testify. The commission’s legal team has issued two summons for Zuma to appear between the 18 and 22 January 2021 as well as between the 15 and 19 February. The commission earlier lodged an urgent application at the Constitutional Court for an order declaring as unlawful Zuma’s abrupt walk-out of the commission’s proceedings on 19 November and to compel him to appear before the commission. Zuma walked out of proceedings when his bid to have  Zondo recuse himself was denied. Former President Jacob Zuma’s application for Deputy Justice Zondo’s recusal: The former president’s lawyers alleged that their client had been treated unfairly by the commission, ignoring and ridiculing his earlier evidence as well as in the manner it selected witnesses and some statements made by Zondo. Commission lawyers, however, rejected the claims saying they did not pass the test of what constitutes bias. Evidence leader at the State Capture Commission Paul Pretorius challenged the application by Zuma and his lawyers for the recusal of Raymond Zondo. Pretorious said Zuma’s claims do not pass the test of bias as they make no allegation of actual bias against their client by Justice Zondo.
