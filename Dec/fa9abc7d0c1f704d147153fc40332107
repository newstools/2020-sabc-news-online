The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) says it wants the country to be placed back on lockdown Level three or Level two to help reduce the spread of the virus. Denosa says health-care workers cannot cope with the current second wave. Denosa acting Secretary-General Cassim Lekhoathi told SABC News that the co-operation of the public to adhere to protocols and regulations can assist health care workers in the fight against COVID-19. “The issue of the opening up of alcohol has really gone out of hand. People are not adhering to this thing. Health education should be enforced. People need to be reminded that we are not out of the woods from the first (wave). Now on the second wave, things are just getting out of hand .. and people are dying.” “And we don’t need to bring proof to see how many people are being buried on a day to day basis, so as Dr Coetzee is saying the communities out there do have a role to play. Because no amount of vaccine, no amount of policing will help the situation. We need the involvement of the communities to assist us to fight this enemy,” adds Lekhoathi.
