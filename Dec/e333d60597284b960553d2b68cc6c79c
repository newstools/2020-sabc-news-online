The African Transformation Movement (ATM) has threatened to go to court and challenge National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise’s decision. Modise has rejected a request for a secret ballot on the motion of no confidence against President Cyril Ramaphosa. The party has sponsored the motion which is expected to be debated on Thursday. President Ramaphosa will face his first motion of no confidence since his inauguration following 2019 general elections. This, after the ATM, invoked section 102 of the Constitution to attempt to remove Ramaphosa through a vote of no confidence. The ATM is working to garner support for its motion of confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa: For the ATM’s motion to succeed, it will have to be supported by all opposition MPs plus at least 51 MPs from the ANC. The ATM is pinning its hopes on MPs voting according to their conscience rather than toe a party line. As a result, the party is demanding that MPs be allowed to vote by secret ballot. If the ATM’s motion were to succeed, something which is highly unlikely, it would mean that Ramaphosa and his executive would
have to step down
