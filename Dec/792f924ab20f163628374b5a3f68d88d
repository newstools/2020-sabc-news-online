The party’s National Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says, “COPE is expecting the president to announce the same restrictions that he has announced in the Nelson Mandela Metro. As we can see that the COVID-19 infections have gone up we want to save lives we are not here to criticise,  it is in our hands and not in the hands of the president.” Discussion on President Ramaphosa’s address  The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) expects curbs on the sale of alcohol and taverns operating times, as well as restrictions on beaches, as many people are expected to descend on coastal towns for the holiday season. Both the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and Freedom Front Plus (FFPlus) believe a hard lockdown is unnecessary. “There should be no emotion of hard lockdown. Due consideration needs to be given to the tourism sector and transport sector which have been hardest hit. A targeted approach to where there are flare-ups is needed,” says ACDP MP Wayne Thring. “The regionals risk approach analysis must be done so that hotspots can be dealt with. It is not necessary to have a complete lockdown if protocols are followed,” says FFPlus leader Pieter Groenewald. Discussion on the spike in COVID-19 infections in SA with Dr Kgosi Letlape
