Education expert Mary Metcalfe says the Department of Basic Education’s decision to make matrics rewrite the leaked papers is the right one given the cyber nature of the problem. Metcalf says the department has no choice but to make the difficult decision. “If the investigations and if the marking show that the sharing of the papers have been wider than current information suggests, it will then be too late and impossible to reconvene the matric learners to rewrite the papers. They [matriculants] will not be ready for receiving those results in February and everything that must follow,” explains Metcalf. However, lobby group AfriForum has joined organisations that have lodged urgent court action against the department. They include the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) and the Congress of South African Students (Cosas). On Friday, Minister Angie Motshekga announced that learners would rewrite Mathematics Paper Two and Physical Science Paper Two on December 15 and 17, respectively.
