The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro’s Acting Mayor Thsonono Buyeye has made an impassioned plea to residents to comply with COVID-19 regulations and guidelines. He made this announcement at the funeral service for African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip in the Metro, Ncediso Captain, in Port Elizabeth. Captain died last week due to COVID-19 complications. Nelson Mandela Bay is the COVID-19 hotspot in the province. Buyeye is concerned about the increasing number of infections in the Metro. “The unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 is a challenge that is still upon us. As leaders, we try to alleviate, contain, minimise, and prevent the escalation of the disaster. We need all hands on deck. We urge the community of Nelson Mandela Bay to assist us by simply adhering to the precautionary measures of COVID-19 for all of us to stay alive.” Nelson Mandela Bay Metro becomes the epicentre of COVID-19 infections in South Africa:  Meanwhile, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has warned that if people do not strictly adhere to COVID-19 safety measures during the festive season, the country is likely going to face a  second wave of infections.
