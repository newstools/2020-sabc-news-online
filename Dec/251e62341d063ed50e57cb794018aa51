A bail hearing has been set for two men arrested in connection with a triple farm murder in Bishopstowe outside Pietermaritzburg, in KwaZulu-Natal, earlier this week. Lizo Madukane and Thembelani Majola are suspected of stabbing to death 58-year-old Daniel du Bruin, his wife Glynis and his father Collin at the Hooggellee Farm on Monday night. Daniel du Bruinâ€™s body was found by his son outside the farm house. Madukane and Majola face three charges of murder and a charge of robbery with aggravating circumstances. It is believed that they stole a safe and money to the value of about R10 000. Prosecutor Renee Padayachee told the court that the State intends opposing bail due to the seriousness of the crime and the prevalence of this type of crime. Padayachee also said that the physical address of the accused- who are believed to have been seasonal farm workers from the Eastern Cape- needs to be verified. The State says it is also opposing bail to safeguard its only witness. The accused will make a formal bail application on January 12.
