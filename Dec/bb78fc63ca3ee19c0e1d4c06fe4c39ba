He says the new variant started spreading in the Eastern Cape and has spread along the Garden Route before spreading to KwaZulu-Natal, Cape Town and other parts of the country. De Oliviera says the new coronavirus has a lot of mutations or changes in its genetic material. The Ministerial Advisory Committee’s Professor Salim Abdool Karim said the second wave in the Western Cape is much more than the first wave.
