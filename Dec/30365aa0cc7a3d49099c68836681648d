Three people have sustained injuries following an explosion at a factory in Germiston, east of Johannesburg this afternoon. Earlier ER24 paramedics declared one person dead at the scene but later corrected the statement. Two were airlifted by medical helicopter to a hospital for further medical care, while the other person was transported by road to the hospital. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are not yet known but local authorities are on scene for further investigations. CORRECTION: No fatalities on the scene in Germiston as reported earlier. Unfortunately, we made a mistake in our earlier press release.https://t.co/8xyJmD7TJz â€” ER24 EMS (Pty) Ltd.
