A memorial service will be held on Tuesday morning for the Bafokeng Queen Mother Semane Molotlegi at the Phokeng Civic Centre near Rustenburg in the North West. She died last week after a long illness at the age of 77. Hundreds of people are expected to attend the memorial service. Amongst those expected to pay their last tribute to the Queen Mother, are government dignitaries from here in the country and the neighbouring Botswana. Molotlegi, is the mother of the current King of Bafokeng, Kgosi Leruo, and paternal aunt of former Botswana President, Ian Khama. Earlier last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa conveyed his condolences to the Royal Bafokeng Nation. The Queen Mother has been described as a philanthropist and community builder who was a patron of the Girl Guides Association of South Africa, the women’s national football team Banyana Banyana and a number of charities. She was also actively involved in advocating for children’s rights and was a patron of the World Children’s Prize.
