KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the current rapid increase in the rise of coronavirus infections and deaths from COVID-19 related complications in the country should serve as a wake up call for all South Africans. The country has recorded another 8 166 cases in the past 24-hour cycle, bringing the total number of cases to 836 764. The Department of Health says 173 people have died from COVID-19 related complications – taking the national death toll to 22 747. Zikalala says it’s worrying that KwaZulu-Natal is one of the four provinces identified as the drivers of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. “We implore everyone to observe the safety protocols which include the regular washing of hands, social distancing, avoid shaking hands, avoid crowded places and always wear face masks. Let us also be safe on our roads and prevent unnecessary deaths, injuries and grief,” adds Zikalala.
