Almost half of the small businesses in South Africa were forced to shut down due to the coronavirus lockdown. That is according to a new report from Financial services firm, Finfind. The report examines the impact of the lockdown on small medium and micro-businesses. CEO of Finfind, Darlene Menzies, says the study found that around 43% of small businesses had to close down. “The study that we did was a five-month study. So, from the beginning of lockdown level five up until August month-end. The study had a look at some of the stats in the entertainment industry, restaurants and tourism. 60% of permanent jobs [were] lost, 76% of part-time jobs and SMEs were taking on 53% less casual labourers. If we look at the sample we had, of 1 500 businesses, that took into account the 60% … was 4 600 jobs lost in those 1500 businesses,” explains Menzies.
