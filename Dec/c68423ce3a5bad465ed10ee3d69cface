Police in North West have condemned the assault of a suspect and the killing of another, allegedly by members of the community at Reivilo near Taung. Police say the two men were badly beaten by community members who saw them transporting three stolen cattle. Farm owners had received a tip-off from locals about suspicious people transporting cattle in a bakkie to Dithakong village in the Northern Cape. The farm owners caught two of the four suspects. They and other locals then allegedly assaulted the two suspects with knobkerries, iron rods and hammers. One of the suspects died on the scene, while the other was transported to the Vryburg Hospital with serious injuries. It is alleged that the mob also burnt the suspects’ vehicle. The remaining two suspects fled the scene and are still at large.  Provincial Commissioner condemns the killing and assault of a suspects by mob
