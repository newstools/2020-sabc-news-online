The Department of Energy says the petrol price is set for another decrease at midnight by 13 cents per litre. Diesel, however, will increase by 19 cents a litre. Illuminating paraffin will also increase by as much as 38 cents a litre. AA spokesperson, Layton Beard, says the rand appreciated against the US Dollar, leading to a lower contribution to Basic Fuel Prices. “International petroleum prices [and] the international prices have really spiked specifically the last two weeks of November. Although the rand has fared very well against the dollar, the strength hasn’t really been enough to offset that spike in international prices and that’s why we seeing a bit of a mixed bag of the fuel prices.” “I think the silver lining is that at the moment the rand looks stable against the dollar and if that trend continues looking further ahead from December going into January, that’s also good news for motorists,” explains Beard. In June, the price of petrol increased by over R1 per litre. The video below is reporting on the petrol price increase in June:
