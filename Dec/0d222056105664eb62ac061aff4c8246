The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has conceded that it should do more to protect the integrity of the matric examinations. It, however, says criminals will always go out of their way to ensure that some examination papers are leaked. Department of Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says, “It’s not that it’s something that is normal, [it] has happened before and we could have prevented it. Yes, we can prevent it, but as long as there are people who feel that they can cheat the system without anyone seeing them, things like this will always happen. But, we need to do all that we can as a department to make sure that we protect the system.” Minister Angie Motshekga announced on Friday that learners would rewrite Mathematics paper two and Physical Science paper two on December 15 and 17 respectively. Matriculants to rewrite leaked exams papers:  Several quarters have blasted the department for the rewrite decision. The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) says it will head to court on Monday to seek an urgent interdict to stop the rewrite. An employee of a Johannesburg-based company contracted by the department to print matric exam papers is being prosecuted for allegedly leaking the Maths paper. He is out on bail and will return to court in January. Mhlanga elaborates on the DBE’s rewrite decision in the video below:
