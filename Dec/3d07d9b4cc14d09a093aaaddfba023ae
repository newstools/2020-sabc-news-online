The ANC’s high-stakes three-day National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting continues today. The virtual talks began on Sunday and will be testing the constitutionality of the 2015 ANC National General Council (NGC) resolution relating to the stepping down of members who face criminal charges. ANC NEC to discuss future of all leaders charged with corruption:  The NGC resolved that all those accused of corruption and other serious crimes, including those charged in courts, must step aside from their positions or responsibilities; to protect the image of the ANC. ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule, Home Affairs Portfolio Committee Chairperson, Bongani Bongo, and member of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, Zandile Gumede, are among those facing fraud and corruption charges. In August, President Cyril Ramaphosa wrote a letter to ANC members reiterating the step-aside rule. However in November, ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said for now the resolution is on hold while the party seeks legal advice. This week’s meeting is said to be looking different legal opinions on how to deal with the matter. ANC NEC meeting analysis with Sandile Swana:  A number of issues confronting the nation, ranging from the economic transformation and recovery plan to the impact of the COVID-19, are also up for discussion at the governing party’s last ANC NEC meeting for the year.
