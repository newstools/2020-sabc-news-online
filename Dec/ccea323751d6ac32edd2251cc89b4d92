Former Eskom CEO Matshela Koko has denied allegations he gave his daughter a billion rands worth of Eskom contracts. Koko is currently giving evidence before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, underway in Johannesburg. He also alleged that former Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise, Ben Martins, suspended him telephonically without following proper procedure. “One of the things that I expected is that people who said that come and give evidence to you or they go to the Hawks or to the police … For four years, I have been accused of giving my daughter a billion rands. And for four years, I have not been talked to by the police or the law enforcement agencies, or the Commission. You know why? Because I never did it.” LIVE – Koko testifying on Eskom: Koko has also told the Commission that Eskom had one of its best performances since 2001 under his and former CEO Brian Molefe’s leadership. He says they both inherited a generation fleet that was more than 30 years old. Koko says they also did the most maintenance under his, Ben Ngubane’s and Molefe’s leadership. Eskom was a global utility for energy in 2001, hitting its lowest point in 2015.
