The Northern Cape has recorded at least 25  Christmas births. The first baby was born five minutes into Christmas at Kuruman. Health MEC Maruping Lekwene visited new mothers at the Galeshewe Day Hospital to wish them well. Lekwene says the birth of the babies is a source of inspiration during a year when many people have died to COVID-19 related complications. “As the department, as the MEC, it was just to come and give support and also appreciate our new babies. During COVID we have lost a number of lives, in the country, in the world, in the province, so new births, it’s a sign of hope; inspiring all of us not to despair but to persevere. We must hold hands and walk together.” Meanwhile, a total of 55 babies have been born since Friday midnight in Limpopo. Four teenagers are among the mothers of the newly-born babies from the Vhembe and Capricorn districts respectively. Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba has expressed happiness that the mothers and babies are doing well. “As a province, we are really blessed by the fact that from 12am until 5am we’ve been blessed by 55 babies of which twenty are boys and thirty-three are girls. Our first baby was delivered from Kgapane hospital 12:30 by a thirty-five-year-old mother, both the mother and the baby are doing well.
