Power utility Eskom has announced that it will implement load shedding from 22h00 tonight until 5am tomorrow. This will be repeated on Wednesday. In a statement, Eskom says the move is to ensure that the power utility will meet demand in January when economic activity resumes. “This load shedding is necessary to preserve emergency generation reserves in preparation for higher demand expected during January as economic activity resumes. ” Eskom currently has 9 745MW on planned maintenance, while 11 346 MW capacity is unavailable due to planned maintenance. South Africans have been urged to use power sparingly. The power utility earlier sent out a load reduction schedule for areas in Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo.
