The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) says it might seek leave to appeal this morning’s judgment of the Labour Court in Johannesburg dismissing its application to compel the SABC to retract redundancy letters issued as part of its retrenchment process. The union also wanted the public broadcaster to engage in a fair process regarding its restructuring plans which could see as many as 400 permanent staff members lose their jobs. In the video below, the Labour Court dismisses Bemawu’s urgent application against job cuts:  The SABC has argued that the restructuring is necessary to make the public broadcaster financially sustainable. Bemawu president Hannes du Buisson says they will first study the judgment and then decide the way forward. “We haven’t studied the judgment in-depth and we may decide to take this matter on appeal. This is not the end of the road for SABC employees, this is in terms of the process that is being followed. We in fact have got what we wanted and that is further consultations and that is currently happening,” explains Du Buisson.

SABC COO Ian Plaatjies says that the court ruling validates the processes they’ve followed. The video below is an interview with Plaatjies:
