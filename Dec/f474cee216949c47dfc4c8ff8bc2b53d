Gauteng Traffic Community Safety says seven people have been killed in seven different fatal crashes in the province. These are the numbers recorded from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day and traffic officials warn the number of fatalities could increase. Gauteng Traffic Police Community Safety spokesperson Obed Sibasa says drunk driving and pedestrian fatal crashes remain a major concern. “Out of the seven fatalities, 3 are pedestrians, 3 passengers and one biker. Contributing factors, pedestrians not visible on the roads, speeding, failing to stop at intersections and drunk driving. Drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, the highest breath alcohol reading was 1.10, a potential killer.” Meanwhile, police have arrested two suspects in Bellville in Cape Town’s northern suburbs and confiscated two stolen firearms. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk says members of the flying squad received information about a vehicle that was involved in a robbery at a house in Malmesbury earlier this month. Officers spotted the car in Voortrekker road, Bellville. In the vehicle, they found two firearms that were stolen in Roodepoort. The suspects are expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of possession of ammunition and unlicensed firearms.
