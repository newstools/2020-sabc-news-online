The Democratic Alliance (DA) has weighed in on the latest developments within the African National Congress (ANC). The DA says if the party is serious about corruption, its Secretary-General Ace Magashule and others should step aside. DA Spokesperson, Siviwe Gwarube says they have long held that the ANC is unable to act against its own leaders accused of corruption.  This after the ANC’s Integrity Commission recommended on Tuesday that Magashule vacate his position as the Secretary General, as well as the member of the ANC National Executive Committee. Gwarube says, “The DA has long held that the ANC is unable to act against their own corrupt leaders because the issue of corruption runs deep in the organization. The DA has no interest in internal ANC issues because these processes have not yielded any results in the fight against corruption.” However, the ANC has called on the media and public to allow the party the space to deal with its internal processes over report on Magashule. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe says the National Executive Committee (NEC) will receive the report and discuss the matter only when it meets again early next year. He says it will then make a pronouncement after considering both the report as well as guidelines by the national leadership on instances where party members accused of corruption must step aside.
