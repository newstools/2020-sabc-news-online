President Donald Trump said he is worried the United States (US) will have an “illegitimate President,” just days before the country’s Electoral College is expected to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory, and blamed his loss on local Democrats who ‘rigged’ the election, during an interview with FOX & Friends on Saturday that first aired Sunday. The President said he plans to move forward with lawsuits challenging the election results and lambasted the Supreme Court for declining to take a case he hoped would overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory. “I am so disappointed in them. No judge including the Supreme Court of the United States has had the courage to allow it to be heard,” Trump said. The nation’s high court late on Friday rejected an unprecedented lawsuit by Texas seeking to throw out voting results from four states. In this video, President-elect Joe Biden addresses the nation in light of his victory over Trump:  Trump has alleged widespread election fraud without evidence, while Biden has proceeded to plan his administration, appointing senior advisers and making cabinet picks despite the president’s efforts to undermine his legitimacy. Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede despite losing to Biden. The Democratic former vice president won 306 votes to Trump’s 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College, which allots votes to all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on population.
