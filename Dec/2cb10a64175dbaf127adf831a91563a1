The Walter Sisulu Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape says they will strengthen enforcement following a street bash in the area. The Eastern Cape has been identified as a COVID-19 hotspot, with restrictions placed on gatherings. Despite their awareness campaign, the Municipality says people are not adhering to the rules, such as the wearing of masks and social distancing. Infections spiked over a day and some people have not yet been tested. Walter Sisulu Municipal Mayor Bulelwa Khweyiya says they will adopt a tougher approach. “We requested our law enforcers to go to these areas, remember we have parks, we have recreational facilities, we’ve closed those recreational facilities, but people, especially young people, decided to do bashes on the streets and in taverns around the municipality. Our next plan now, we are no longer going to warn people, together with the law enforcers we want the actions to be done because people are mingling without masks, so anyone who’s not adhering to the law, we are not going to smile.” Latest coronavirus stats in SA: 5 968 692 883 687 774 585 85 275 23 827 798 412 As at 16 December 2020 48 118 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Eastern Cape monitors lockdown regulations through traffic safety operation:  Breakdown of infections according to provinces as of 16 December: Increase in WC (from 2 785 yesterday to 3 233 today)
