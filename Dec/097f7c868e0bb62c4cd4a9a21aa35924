Members of the Electoral College will gather later on Monday in state legislatures across the country to formally cast their ballots for President. It’s a process that usually gets little attention with Joe Biden projected to have won the Presidential election weeks ago, but due to efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the result, the vote is not only highly anticipated but also likely to attract additional scrutiny. President-elect Joe Biden won the electoral college by 306 to President Trump’s 232, with the Democrat easily surpassing the 270 threshold to win the White House. Monday’s vote should affirm that result but reports suggest that efforts were underway to convince Republican-led state legislatures to seat their own members to the electoral college and ignore the popular vote in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. That effort has not gained much traction. The Courts have yielded little success to the President and his allies with the Supreme Court on Friday rejecting an effort to overturn the election result in those four states. Of additional interest is that only 32 states and the District of Columbia require electors to vote for the candidate they’re pledged to while in states where no such laws exist, the possibility of some electors going rogue cannot be ruled out.
