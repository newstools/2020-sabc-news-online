ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba says his party is considering changing its logo so that it can be registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). The electoral body rejected ActionSA’s application to register to contest elections saying its colours and the logo are similar to an already registered political party, Party of Action. ActionSA appealed this decision but its appeal was unsuccessful. As a result, the party could not contest last month’s by-elections. Mashaba says members have resolved that the party must change its logo. “So we consulted with them and we said we’ve got two options. We can take this matter to court. We will win this case or do we change the logo. 92% of our people said you know what Ntate Mashaba and ActionSA, we are not here about logos. We’re having challenges in our country. Our people are losing jobs. Our country’s economy is collapsing. Corruption is getting out of hand. That is what we want you as ActionSA to represent. Forget about the logo. Go ahead with the changing of this logo so that we can go forward.” Another abandoned factory by the Tripartite Alliance in Temba, Hammanskraal.
