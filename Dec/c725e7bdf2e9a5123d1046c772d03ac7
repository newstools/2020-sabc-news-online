Fifteen members of one family have tested positive for coronavirus in Limpopo. Provincial Health MEC, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, revealed this during an interview with SABC News on Saturday. She attributed an increase in the number of cases in the province to the high number of visitors during this festive period. Ramathuba says 14 relatives were infected by a family member who works in Gauteng and recently came back with flu-like symptoms. “This morning I was dealing with one family where there is a daughter who came back from Gauteng, and tested positive was asymptomatic and after testing we then did the whole family now five days later since she has arrived. I think its day seven now, they have all I think it’s 15 of them including the uncle and aunt because over the last week, they had some family gathering. These are really the issues that really call for concern for us as a province,” says Ramathuba.
