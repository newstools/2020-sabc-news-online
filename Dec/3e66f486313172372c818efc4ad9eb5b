Political analyst Ebrahim Fakir says although the vote of no confidence in President Cyril Ramaphosa comes at a time when he’s in a position of vulnerability, it’s unlikely to succeed. Ramaphosa will face the first motion of no confidence in his leadership in Parliament on Thursday. The motion was filed by the African Transformation Movement (ATM), a political party which was established in 2018. National Assembly Thandi Modise has since declined that the motion be conducted through a secret ballot. This was communicated through a statement issued by Parliament on Tuesday. ATM leader Vuyolwethu Zungula filed the no confidence motion in February before the COVID-19 lockdown began. It is linked to allegations that Ramaphosa misled Parliament about donations made to his CR17 campaign. Fakir says it would take a miracle for such a motion to succeed. “Remember, you need 201 members in the majority in terms of the Constitution and even if you have, the DA has already made it clear that that it will not support the motion, this is the problem. You don’t know that this is going to work. The EFF with its 44 odd members is going to play a game as they always do.” In the video below, Fakir outlines the motion of no confidence:
