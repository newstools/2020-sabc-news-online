Deputy President David Mabuza says the high debt and liquidity problems that Eskom is facing warrant extraordinary intervention. He was delivering a keynote address at the 25th Annual National Summit of National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac), which will result in the signing of a social compact agreement to support the stability of Eskom.

He says the agreement sets out steps that government, business and labour should commit to in supporting Eskom. “Compromise and trade-offs are central and not the pursuit of a zero sum game where no one comes out a winner. Communication is a key tool to employ to get a buy-in from communities. Hence part of the Eskom social compact is about the revival of the campaign to encourage people to pay for basic municipal services,” explains Mabuza.
