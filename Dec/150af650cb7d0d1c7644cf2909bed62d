Deputy President David Mabuza has hailed the bravery of frontline workers as the country continues to battle the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic. Mabuza was delivering the Christmas message ahead of the holiday on Friday. Officials have expressed concerns over the rapid manner in which a new variant of the coronavirus transfers among people. Over 14 000 cases have been reported in the past 24-hours – the country’s highest recorded infections since the start of the pandemic. At least 411 people have also died from COVID-19 related illnesses on Wednesday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 25 657. Mabuza says the healthcare system remains a priority:  Mabuza said ordinary citizens must play their part in preventing the spread of infections. “Our frontline workers in key sectors of our lives embody our patriotic spirit of commitment, resilience and personal sacrifice. They have put their lives in harms’ way in order to save lives and protect all of us.” “Some of them have paid the ultimate sacrifice in service of our nation. As we celebrate Christmas, we salute all frontline workers for their bravery, compassion and national duty. We salute each and everyone who lost their lives in the line of duty.  As ordinary citizens, we must play our part in preventing the spread of Covid-19 infections.” Mabuza said despite the challenges faced in 2020, South Africans must endeavour for new possibilities and aspirations in the New Year. “It is time to cast our eyes on new dreams, new possibilities, new hopes and new aspirations for the future of our families, our nation and ourselves as individuals. Even in the face of difficulties, the Christmas period is a time for renewal of our collective resolve as a nation to unite behind the vision of a cohesive and inclusive society.” Christmas Speech 2020 by Deputy President David Mabuza from SABC News:
