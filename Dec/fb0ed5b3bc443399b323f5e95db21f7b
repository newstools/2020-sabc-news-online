The Judicial Conduct Tribunalâ€™s hearings on the complaint lodged by Justices of the Constitutional Court against Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe have started in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg. Hlophe is accused of trying to influence Constitutional Court judges in a case involving former president Jacob Zuma. In the video below, Casac discusses Judge President John Hlophe:  The case relates to the validity of searches during the multi-billion-rand arms deal investigation of Zuma about 12 years ago. The judges laid a complaint after Hlophe allegedly approached Justices Bess Nkabinde and Chris Jafta to improperly influence them in the case before the Constitutional Court. A tribunal was set up at the recommendation of a subcommittee of the Judicial Service Commission in 2013. Numerous delays have marred the matter since 2008.
