Former Eskom CEO, Matshela Koko, is back at the commission of inquiry into State capture this Friday evening. He is returning to give evidence regarding the suspension of executives at Eskom in 2015. Last week, he told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo he hoped the commission will help clear his name. Link to the stream:  Koko was also one of the executives suspended with three others during that period. He has told the commission that Eskom had one of its best performances since 2001 under his and former CEO Brian Molefe’s leadership. Koko says they both inherited a generation fleet that was more than 30 years old. Koko says they also did the most maintenance under his, Ben Ngubane and Molefe’s leadership. Eskom was a global utility for energy in 2001, hitting its lowest point in 2015.
