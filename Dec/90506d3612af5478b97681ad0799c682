Some canoe operators and undocumented foreign nationals have been arrested by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) along the Limpopo River near the Beitbridge Border Post outside Musina in Limpopo. The canoe operators charge R150 to R200 per person to help cross the full and crocodile-infested Limpopo River into South Africa and Zimbabwe. SANDF’s Brigadier General Mafi Mugobozi says soldiers are trying their best to stop illegal movement along the border line. “SANDF is doing its best to prevent such acts.
