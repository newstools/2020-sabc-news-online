The Congress of South African Students has called on learners not to sit for a rewrite of the exam papers that were leaked. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has announced that all matric learners will re-write the Mathematics Paper Two and Physical Science Paper Two. The Mathematics Paper Two will be written on the 15th of this month and Physical Science Paper Two will be written on the 17 December. An employee of a Johannesburg-based company contracted by the Department to print matric exam papers has been arrested following an investigation by the Hawks. COSAS national spokesperson Douglas Ngobeni says they reject Motshekga’s announcement. “The Department of Basic Education is just clowning. We reject the re-writing of the paper. Our learners must not go to the classrooms to write the paper.” He adds: “And we are also taking the Department of Basic Education to court to stop that arrangement.” Quality assurance body Umalusi concluded that the integrity and credibility of the two papers were compromised and therefore, a rewrite was needed.
