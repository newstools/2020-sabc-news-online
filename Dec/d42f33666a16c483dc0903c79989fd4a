Authorities at the Maseru Bridge Border Post, between South Africa and Lesotho, say festive travel is picking up, as dozens of people cross over to spend Christmas with their loved ones. Lesotho Home Affairs Minister Motlalentoa Letsosa explains the challenges being faced at the Maseru border. “Every December, Basotho are allowed to come back to Lesotho even if they don’t have a passport. It has happened this December. It is only Maseru that will give you a headache. Why is it not consistent that everyone who doesn’t have a passport at Maseru Bridge to be penalised? Why is it not consistent? It shows that someone knows they are doing something wrong, so they can’t do it consistently, but they make sure they catch a few people to give them money or take them to be judged.” Lesotho has urged citizens, who are still in South Africa, to refrain from crossing into the country illegally as coronavirus (COVID-19) numbers continue to rise rapidly.  Lesotho currently has 2 725 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1 466 recoveries and 51 deaths. In September, the United Nations Development Partner (UNDP) in Lesotho disbursed funds to seven organisations that have come up with outstanding National Response initiatives to mitigate COVID-19.
