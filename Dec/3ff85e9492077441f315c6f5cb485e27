Two weeks after a rainstorm battered their area, the community of Lower Majeakgoro near Pampierstad, in North West, are still waiting on temporary structures promised to them by the local municipality following a storm in the area. The storm destroyed homes and property and uprooted trees, leaving two children dead in its wake. The community of Lower Majeakgoro says they have been left high and dry by the local Greater Taung Municipality. Their area is in a state of disaster following a storm. Electricity lines lie strewn in the area, rainwater pools have formed in the streets and homes have been lost. The residents say this Christmas will be a bleak one if the municipality does not make good on its promises in full. “It would have been better if they built and finished the shacks that they promised us instead of taking so long. It is clear that we don’t matter despite our situation. On top of that, it is raining non-stop,” says one resident. “This delay from our government has left us heartbroken. Now, it is raining and I no longer have a home. The current one is destroyed, but I’m forced to sleep in it. Had they finished building the shack, I would sleep there. This is heartbreaking because I have children,” says another. The municipality started building some temporary shelters for the residents. However, those structures are half-built with no windows or foundation. Greater Taung Municipality Mayor Kgosi Nyoko Motlhabane says the municipality is doing all it can. “Heavy rains are pouring around Taung and there are many disasters and the same team have got to attend to other areas also. That is why I’m saying people should not be impatient. We are aware that some of the shelters haven’t been finished and that will be done very soon.” As the rain keeps pelting down in the area, the residents say they fear the homes where they have sought shelter will also suffer damage and leave them on the streets this festive season.
