At least 370 people have been arrested in KwaZulu-Natal for various crimes since Thursday, in a crackdown by law enforcement agencies. The crimes included serious offences such as rape, murder, and assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. This was revealed by Police Minister Bheki Cele who joined operations in Durban to curb criminal activity and to enforce COVID-19 regulations. Cele also visited a general dealer store at Inanda where five people, including a four-month old baby, were killed on Friday night. On Friday night, unknown gunmen entered this general dealer store and opened fire on pool players. Five people including a four-month-old child, were killed. Three people were hospitalised. Shop owner and relative Felokwakhe Zubane says, “I was in my bedroom when I heard gun shots in the house as I was trying to check what was happening. Two children ran to my bedroom and we locked. I did not know what was happening. Later, when I opened I found one sitting down and already dead. Four died at the house, one died in hospital.” One man has been arrested in connection with the killing and police are on a manhunt for the other attackers. In this video below, Minister Cele releases 2019/20 crime statistics:  Cele blames alcohol for the incidents of crime in the area. He says this poses a further danger with the rising number of COVID-19 infections. Police found several food outlets and taverns in and around Inanda, violating lockdown regulations. Some were selling liquor illegally. Police shut down some outlets while others were given a warning. The Inanda area is notorious for its high crime rate, with rape and murder statistics among the highest in the country. Bheki Cele says, “The non-compliance is really high in shebeens and they are packed beyond its capacity and there is no control in those particular things (sic). No social distancing.” Police are expected to intensify its Operation Safer Festive Season.
