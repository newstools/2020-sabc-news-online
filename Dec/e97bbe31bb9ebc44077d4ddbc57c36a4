Civil society organisation Accountability Now has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa requesting him to suspend the head of a Chapter Nine Institution who is expected in court next month on charges of perjury. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that the official has been issued with a summons to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on January 21, 2021. It says it has taken the decision to prosecute after careful consideration of the evidence. The Hawks received a summons for the individual concerned on Monday night. The person cannot be named until they have appeared in court. The case stems from a complaint laid by the Director of Accountability Now, Paul Hoffman. He says they want Parliament to proceed with the process of removing this person from office. “We have today written to the president and said to him look Mr President, you do have the discretion to suspend her now that the Hawks have persuaded the NPA to proceed with the perjury case won’t you consider suspending her and allow parliament to do its work on a vote for her removal from office. Ramaphosa calls for social cohesion in citizens Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa says the country will not fully recover from apartheid unless government and citizens work together in ensuring social cohesion and the eradication of the inequalities of the past. Ramaphosa says true and meaningful reconciliation will remain what he terms a pipe dream unless the citizens take government’s policies seriously. He was delivering his Reconciliation Day message on Wednesday. “We cannot build a truly caring society so long as the country’s majority live in condition of poverty, inequality and deprivation. While a minority exists in comfort and privilege. We cannot move forward with the process of meaningful reconciliation if policies around economic transformation, affirmative action and land reform are resisted.” Reconciliation Day | Ramaphosa calls for redress of past inequalities in SA
