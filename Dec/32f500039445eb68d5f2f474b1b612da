The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Northern Cape says it is taking the Provincial Department of Education to court for its alleged failure to act against two senior officials of the department accused of sexual harassment. Two female staff members have alleged the incidents date back to 2015 and were reported to the departmental authorities but nothing has been done. One of them spoke to SABC News and detailed how one of the senior officials in the department exposed his private part to her. The EFF says they have been approached by three victims. The EFF’s provincial secretary Shadrack Tlhaole says they cannot sit back and watch the lives of the victims being destroyed. “We are going to take the Department of Education to court for not acting on this problem, on this incident, on these shenanigans that were reported to them for the past five years. For the past five years nothing happened. Especially each and every year if you go to Northern Cape legislature, different members of the executive committee are debating on GBV,” explains Tlhaole.
