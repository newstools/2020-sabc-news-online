Close to 30 households in Nkomazi in Mpumalanga on the border with Eswatini and Mozambique have been left without shelter after a heavy storm ravaged the area. Most of the houses had their roofs blown off in Mgobodzi, Magudu, and Magogeni villages on Tuesday. The Shabangu family is among those whose houses have been damaged. A family member says this is the second time they have experienced this. “We are deeply affected as a child-headed household. We really need assistance, we are many and have no place to sleep. We are now crammed in one room.” #SabcNewsOnline #sabcNews #SabcWeather @SAWeatherServic #TsietsiMonare #MorningLiveSABC #ReenvalSA Today pic.twitter.com/SeQd1KOsF7 — Azwi Tuwani (@atuwani) December 2, 2020  Mpumalanga Today ‘s Weather overview: 2.12.2020 pic.twitter.com/4YTkM4uMJA — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) December 2, 2020
