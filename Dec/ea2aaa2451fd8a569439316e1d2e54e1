Some restaurant owners in Johannesburg are worried that they might not survive under the adjusted Level 3 lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the tighter restrictions last night:  These include a ban on alcohol sales and a stricter curfew for the next two weeks. This comes as the food and beverage industry is still recovering from the first lockdown. The restrictions announced by Ramaphosa have been regarded as a threat to food and alcohol establishments. Although they came as a shock, owner of Topo Gigio in Greenside, Johannesburg, Mark Goldberg, says he understands why the decision had to be made. “I do believe it’s necessary and I do understand why the president is doing what he is doing. I do get that it is necessary to keep the numbers low and stop the spread. It impacts us in a huge way. Alcohol is our number one seller. It’s the reason people come out, they have a good pizza and a few drinks. That is going to hurt us in a way we can’t comprehend, especially for the waiters who rely on commission and tips and it impacts us all.” Latest coronavirus cases in SA:  COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 185946 167239 22896 35162 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 28 DECEMBER 2020 7034 543 638 DEATHS 2160 6366 5356 4020 577 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 011 871 DEATHS | 27 071 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 469 025 RECOVERIES | 849 947 377 86163 276133 38673 24920 199028  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 61874 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Goldberg says the revised curfew is also a worrying factor for the food and alcohol sector. “Eight o’clock doesn’t give people the opportunity to have dinner. They literally have to shove the meal down their throats so they can be home by 9 o’clock. The waiter has to be home by 9’oclock. We can get through it though, like we got through the first lockdown. It’s just a matter of how long we can we keep things in place.” Waiter, Ryan Ray, says many establishments have shut down since the global outbreak of the pandemic. “Here in Greenside, there are so many restaurants that had shut down. The reason was COVID-19. For the survivors that are here, it’s not easy. It’s not the same as it used to be before.” Anxiety brewing amongst restaurant owners:
