President Cyril Ramaphosa says despite the many challenges the country’s municipalities are facing, it is obvious that this local sphere of government has been a key driver of development in South Africa. He was speaking on the first day of the South African Local Government Association’s two-day virtual National Members Assembly. The meeting also has also been called to celebrate 20 years of democratic local government. Co-operative Governance Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as well as delegates from all municipalities, provincial and national government, international partner organisations including SADC and other sister organisations from the continent are attending the meeting. Ramaphosa says, “Our progress has been substantial, and the quality of life of millions of people has been improved. There are schools, libraries and clinics where there once were none. Communities have sanitation and clean drinking water where they were once forced to fend for themselves. Homes have been electrified and streets have been paved.” The President adds: “The provision of services has, over the course of 20 years, lifted millions of people out of poverty and enabled them to enjoy an improving quality of life. But, local government also faces a number of very serious challenges.” The video below is President Ramaphosa’s keynote address:
