Some ANC deployees in five North West municipalities have vowed not to step down. They have taken the stand despite the ANC Interim Provincial Committee’s decision to recall them as mayors, chief whips and speakers. The committee took the decision because they allegedly failed to execute their oversight role. This led to their municipalities being unable to deliver basic services such as water and sanitation. The affected municipalities include Ditsobotla in Lichtenburg, Matlosana in Klerksdorp, Maquassi Hills in Wolmaranstad, Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati in Vryburg and Mahikeng. The committee’s co-ordinator Hlomane Chauke says the core problem is leadership. “We took a decision that about five municipalities, in fact it’s about 10 now, we have to intervene and change the troikas of those municipalities. I think that is the core of the problem that when you say the system is somehow not satisfactory it talks to the issue of leadership because when we expected that when the ANC redeploy these comrades it’s going to be easy based on the assessment we have done. But it was clear that we are going to get resistance.” Chauke says drastic action against those defying the party’s instruction will be enforced. “We are saying that come January we have agreed with the deployees of the ANC who are NEC members who are deployed in the North West, that come January we’re not going to see it, in fact, we are now going to apply the rules of the ANC of any one that fails to implement the party mandate, we are now going to take a stand of DC and remove those comrades.” ANC North West changes mayors, speakers and chief whips:
