Limpopo police are probing a case of theft after the remains of a murder victim disappeared from the government mortuary in Lebowakgomo. Police say the remains of Precious Magabane were taken for forensic investigations and taken back to the mortuary where they have been missing since Wednesday. Magabane was murdered in 2018 and her dismembered body was found wrapped and hidden in a plastic bag in an open veld along the Burgersfort-Lydenburg road. It was then kept at the government mortuary for about two years. This after, the family refused to proceed with the burial stating that police must find other missing body parts. However, the family assigned a funeral parlor earlier this week to fetch the remains from the mortuary so that they can proceed with the burial. On arrival, the undertaker discovered that the remains had gone missing, which led to the family opening the case of theft with the police. Police spokesperson, Motlafela Mojapelo, says the matter is under investigation. “Police in Lebowakgomo have opened a case to investigate an incident in which the remains of the murder victim Precious Magabane allegedly went missing from a government mortuary in Lebowakgomo, the circumstances and the movement of this remains will be fully investigated to determined what exactly happened.” The family held a remembrance ceremony for Magabane at Mahlokoane village outside Burgersfort on Saturday, as it could not proceed with her burial. The family could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, two men Fraz Cheema and Raza Ali have since been arrested for Magabane’s murder.
