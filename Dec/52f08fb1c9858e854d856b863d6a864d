The South Africa Liquor Brand Association (SALBA) has expressed concern over the total shutdown of liquor sales, saying the ban is an opportunity for illegal alcohol trade to go ahead. This as the country moved back to lockdown Level 3 with immediate effect from Monday night. In lockdown Level 3, the sale of alcohol is prohibited. The move comes as the country breached the 1 million mark in COVID-19 infections and record daily increases. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the adjusted Level 3 lockdown includes the closure of beaches, dams, lakes, parks and swimming pools in hot spot areas. SALBA’s spokesperson Sibani Mngadi says, “It’s been proven that during Level 5 and 4 illegal traders, syndicates started selling and that is the area we are concerned about. We would have wished that they [government] would have given limited opportunity for people to purchase liquor legally.” The video below is reporting that alcohol sale and distribution is prohibited:
