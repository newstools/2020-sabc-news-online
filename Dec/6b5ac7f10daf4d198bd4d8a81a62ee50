A Johannesburg church minister says he agrees with the sentiments expressed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng about what may be ‘evil’ COVID-19 vaccines. During a keynote address at an event held at Tembisa Hospital last week, the Chief Justice prayed for divine intervention against “any vaccine that is of the devil”. The country’s top judge was speaking at the hospital east of Johannesburg at an event honouring those who died from COVID19-related complications. Reverend Kelvin Harris leads the Bosmont Congregational Church. He says, “And this is where I agree with Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. COVID-19 is holding the world in its grip. No person, no company, no group, no nation can benefit millions of billions of rand from any vaccine, otherwise such vaccine is from the devil.” Human rights group, Africa for Palestine, lodged yet another complaint against the Chief Justice with the Judicial Service Commission. Social media abuzz after Mogoeng’s prayer Social media was abuzz after the video emerged of Mogoeng’s prayer in which he asked God to intervene in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. “I lock out every demon of COVID-19. I lock out any vaccine that is not of you. If there be any vaccine that is of the devil, meant to infuse 666 in the lives of people, meant to corrupt your DNA, any such vaccine, Lord God Almighty, may it be destroyed by fire.” South Africa is in the second wave of infections and has registered the most infections and COVID-19-related deaths on the continent. Government is studying the data of numerous candidates before purchasing a vaccine. Mogoeng also added that it is an embarrassment that corruption by government officials has been rife during the coronavirus pandemic. He says now is the time for South Africans to find solutions to numerous allegations of corruption in government.
