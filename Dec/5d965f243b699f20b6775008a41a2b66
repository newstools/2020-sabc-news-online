International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor has warned those who intend travelling abroad during the festive season that they may become stranded, as countries change their travel restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) hosted a media briefing on the sector’s 2020 highlights, as well as the upcoming events in 2021. Pandor gave the following advice for those heading abroad amid the pandemic. “We’re making sure that we equip all South Africans who intend travelling abroad during the festive season with information that might help them not to find themselves needing to be repatriated because they are stranded. Countries in the northern hemisphere are encountering a second wave of the pandemic. South Africans should be cautious in travelling to these countries as you may become distressed or even destitute abroad, depending on the levels of lockdown in the respective countries and with the likelihood of international flights that might be cancelled at short notice.” Minister Naledi Pandor briefs the media on 2020 highlights:  Pandor also called on those who will be travelling abroad to ensure adequate precautions are taken due to the possibility that they may experience difficulties overseas. “When you arrive at the country you are travelling to, please register with our embassies abroad. Inform your family or next of kin of your destination and the duration of your stay. Ensure that you meet the immigration requirements of the country you wish to visit. Read thoroughly on the country you intend visiting, as the global situation is unstable. If the country you visit is a high risk one, consider postponing your visit or proceeding with caution if travel is unavoidable.”
