The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is raiding the offices of the National Lotteries Commission (NLC)  in Pretoria following allegations of corruption and maladministration involving top executives giving grants to close associates and friends. This is believed to be causing financial losses to the state. The SIU obtained a search and seizure warrant on Monday as part of its investigation into NLC operations. President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed a proclamation authorising the SIU to probe the allegations. He signed the proclamation in October this year and it came into effect after being published in the Government Gazette last month. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says, “What we are trying to do now is to execute proclamation number 32 of 2020, which says we must look at all transactions that happened from 24 January up until the date of publication which is the 6th of November and we are looking at the maladministration that might have happened, we are looking at all the transactions that might have unduly done and we are also looking at the funding that was done together with the accounts that were given to people.” Below is the full interview with Kaizer Kganyago on the raid:
