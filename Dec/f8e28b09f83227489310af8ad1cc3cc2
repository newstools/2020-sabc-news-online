The ANC has indicated that the removal of Mogalakwena Mayor Adrina Matsemela, the Chief Whip and the Speaker at Mokopane in Limpopo, is aimed at stabilising the municipality and improving service delivery. The three were removed and the ANC says they will be given certain responsibilities as deployees of the party. The municipality has been unstable for some years. There have been allegations of corruption, deep factions amongst ANC members leading to the killing of some councillors and the municipality put under administration. Leihlo la Sechaba on the Mogalakwena Municipality instability:  ANC Provincial Spokesperson Donald Selamolela says the municipality has been through interventions from government. “We have always had some challenges in the municipality of Mogalakwena. We have, through the intervention of deployees, the government sent intervention teams to support the municipality. We are happy the collective wisdom of the Provincial Executive Committee on Friday that took the decision. It might be in the interest of progress to redeploy the entirety of the political management team in the municipality.”
