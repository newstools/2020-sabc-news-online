The co-accused of the self-proclaimed prophet, Shepherd Bushiri, is hoping to continue with his bail application on Monday in the Pretoria Magistrates Court. Willah Mudolo is the only one of the five accused who has not yet been released on bail after his arrest in October 2020. Bushiri, his wife, Mary, Landiwe Ntlokwana and Mudolo’s wife, Zethu, have all been released on bail. The group is charged with theft, fraud and money laundering involving more than R100 million. The Bushiri’s are fugitives in South Africa after they contravened their bail conditions and fled to Malawi. South Africa has started with the process of requesting their extradition from Malawi. On Thursday last week head of security for the Bushiris, along with his wife, appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on charges of corruption. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said Clifford and Rosy Resondt are charged with corruption amounting to R500 000. They have been released on bail of R15 000 each and the matter was postponed to February 25, 2021. Advocate Johan du Toit ob Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, wife Mary extradition process: Resondt works for the Organised Crime Unit of the police service. It is alleged that in 2018 her husband, Clifford, was arrested for the alleged rape of his wife’s niece. The R500 000 that’s at the centre of the case against the couple, was allegedly then transferred from the bank account of Pastor Shepherd Bushiri’s Ministries to Rosy’s account and then into an account of the victim’s parents. The NPA said the charges against Resondt were later withdrawn by the victim. The couple’s leader, Shepherd Bushiri, and his wife Mary are still in Malawi after having escaped justice in South Africa.
