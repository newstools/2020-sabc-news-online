The facts in this story have been amended to correct an earlier version. In the earlier story, it was reported that the Central Energy Fund (CEF) said both grades of petrol will decrease by 13-cents per litre, while diesel will increase by 19.86 cents per litre in January. This increase was actually effected on Wednesday, 2 December. In a statement issued by the CEF a month ago, it said illuminating paraffin will increase by up to 38 cents per litre earlier this month. The CEF says the average international product prices for petrol decreased in the period under review whilst diesel and illuminating paraffin increased. The randâ€™s appreciation against the US Dollar also contributed to the mixed fuel prices. In June, the price of petrol increased by over R1 per litre.
