Residents in parts of Soweto and the Vaal, south of Johannesburg, will be without electricity on Wednesday evening. It’s part of Eskom’s planned power cuts, known as load reduction, and is geared at avoiding network overloading in high density areas. Gauteng Eskom Spokesperson, Reneiloe Semenya, had said earlier that they would implement load reduction from five on Wednesday afternoon until 10 tonight. “In Soweto, Bram Fischerville, Chiawelo, Dhlamini, Dobsonville, Doornkop, Meadowlands, Moroka, Protea Glen and the surrounding areas. In the Sedibeng region we have Boipatong, Geluksdal AH, Kanana Park, Orange Farm, Sharpeville, Tshepiso and some parts of Vanderbijlpark. Customers are urged to switch off all electrical appliances during the load reduction period, to avoid any surges when the electricity is restored.” Eskom Load Reduction Notice Date: 23 December 2020#EskomGauteng Please see below provincial statements for details and areas that will be affected today from 17:00 until 22:00. pic.twitter.com/Fv9sIfIehs — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) December 23, 2020
