Eskom has announced that there will be no load shedding on Sunday. The power utility says this follows the recovery of some of its generators. Eskom implemented stage 2 load shedding from 06:00 am to 23:00 pm on Saturday. It later announced that it would change to stage 1.  The update from Eskom was released on Sunday morning. The company says their teams are working around the clock to return many units to service. Eskom requests that people continue using electricity sparingly in order to help limit the impact of load shedding. #PowerAlert 1 No loadshedding will be implemented today as the emergency generation reserves have sufficiently recovered, Eskom thanks the people of South Africa for support during loadshedding@News24 @SABCNews @NewzroomAfrika @eNCA @IOL @ewnupdates @SundayTimesZA pic.twitter.com/8bTPVrsTWP — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) December 13, 2020
