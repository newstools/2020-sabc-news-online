Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says they are awaiting an update from the Hawks by the end of next week on the leaking of matric papers this year. She says one person has been directly linked to the leaking of the papers. It has emerged that the Maths, Physics and Business Economics papers were leaked. However, the department says it picked up the Business Studies leak quickly and had been able to use a back-up paper instead. Motshekga says they have received an incomplete report on the leaks. “What we are trying to establish now, which we are finding difficult, is the extent of the leaks but the fact that the papers leaked are a fact because we have established they did leak, but the problem is to what extent. Some of the learners only saw it in the morning, some saw it in the taxi, so we are not sure about the impact and what we should do because it is not the kids who stole the paper.” Media Release: Council of Education Ministers receive preliminary report into matric examination question paper leaks pic.twitter.com/PySXvF6bRh — Dep. Basic Education (@DBE_SA) December 1, 2020  The preliminary investigation into the Maths Paper Two leak revealed that the leak was confined to the Limpopo and Gauteng provinces. Matric learners in the two provinces shared the paper electronically using Apps including WhatsApp. The department has identified some learners who got access to the paper. Quality assurance body Umalusi says the leak may undermine the integrity of the exams in the affected provinces:  Those with information that can assist in the investigation have been urged to come forward. DBE invites anybody with information to come forward and help. A full scale audit of the exam administration system is underway. pic.twitter.com/ibkYiyMAzE — Dep.
