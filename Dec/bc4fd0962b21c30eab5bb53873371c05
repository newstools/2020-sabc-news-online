ActionSA is now an officially registered political party. The new party will contest 2021’s local government elections under the leadership of former Johannesburg mayor, Herman Mashaba who has been in and out of court fighting for his party to appear on the ballot paper. This came after the IEC refused to register ActionSA due to similarities of the logo with an already registered party. Party of Action accuses Herman Mashaba of stealing their logo:  IEC rejects ActionSA application for registration as a political party:  ActionSA changed its logo, which was then approved by the IEC. In a statement, Mashaba says the party’s new logo is consistent with the originally filed one. “Our new logo, which was approved by the IEC, remains consistent with the logo that was originally filed. This was important to ActionSA because its identity was the subject of a nine-month-long public engagement process. It keeps the shapes of the South African flag infused with the directional arrow denoting the progress of the ‘A’ for Action. In real terms, the colours of the logo have simply changed to green.” Our confirmed registration from @IECSouthAfrica 2021 is going to be an exciting year for #ActionSA and South Africa! pic.twitter.com/V1Lf6fGUOf — ActionSA (@Action4SA) December 13, 2020  Mashaba says regardless of difficulties in registering the party, ActionSA did not slow down its work. “The #ActAsOne tour has seen the party delivering its offer across the country and our structures continue to grow, now standing strong with 160 000 volunteers.” The part says it will continue with its work of being an alternative to unseat the ruling party, the ANC.
