The African National Congress Women’s League in KwaZulu-Natal says it would like to see Zandile Gumede back in the position of eThekwini Mayor. This after the ANC’s Integrity Commission in the province gave Gumede the green light to return to her positions, both in the ANC and the provincial legislature. Gumede was asked to step aside after she was arrested in connection with the alleged fraud and corruption in the awarding of waste removal tender. The League’s provincial secretary Nonhlanhla Gabela says Gumede has not been found guilty of any crime. “For now she is still innocent and we are very much worried as the Women’s League, like all other ANC members that are accused of corruption. But we are saying she must be given a fair opportunity like all other ANC members to go through whatever is happening. It is the court which should decide whether she is guilty or not, but it’s not for us to decide.” Also among the accused is the eThekwini city manager Sipho Nzuza. Gumede and 21 co-accused face multiple charges of fraud and corruption relating to a R430 million 2016 Solid Waste tender. In September, the state had requested a postponement for a period of three months to finalise a forensic audit report. During the last court appearance, the court had ordered the State to update the defence teams on the progress of the forensic audit report by November 26. Gumede’s lawyers are expected to file an application to have the case struck off the roll.
