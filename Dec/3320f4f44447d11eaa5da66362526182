Authorities in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape are patrolling the area to ensure that partygoers adhere to the coronavirus lockdown regulations this festive season. Earlier this month, Nelson Mandela Bay was declared a COVID-19 hotspot. The metro’s beaches have been closed, but since last week, authorities had their hands full ensuring compliance with all regulations. The metro’s lifesaving chairperson Earl Ingram says there’s general adherence among members of the public. Ingram says, “Our municipal employees are working with law enforcement to keep the people from the beaches. So our beaches have been empty, especially at night, we do have bars on our beachfront, but we haven’t had drunk people because our lifeguards and law enforcement are working together to make sure that does not happen.” “Please don’t swim in areas where there are no lifeguards. It’s very dangerous and research shows that most drownings occur in these isolated water bodies,” added Ingram.
