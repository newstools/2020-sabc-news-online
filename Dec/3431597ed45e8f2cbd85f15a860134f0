The Pro-Makhado Task Team, which leads Vuwani residents who are resisting to be moved to the Collins Chabane Local Municipality in Limpopo, has confirmed that it has signed an agreement with the government to allow the municipality to service the area. Since its establishment in 2016, the municipality has not serviced Vuwani after angry residents, who demanded to be returned to the Makhado local municipality embarked on a volatile protest. Some provincial departments stepped in as a temporary measure. Pro-Makhado Task Team spokesperson, Arnold Mulaudzi says they hope Co-operative Governance MEC Basikopo Makamu’s commitment to engage the Municipal Demarcation Board on their behalf will assist them. “The MEC of Cogta came and we managed to enter into an agreement that says after 2021 local government elections the MEC of Cogta or the minister will invoke section 22 – 1(b) and request the municipal demarcation board if it happens that they don’t come and engage us on our issues. Then as a result we have agreed with the government that we will cooperate with Collins Chabane Local Municipality in bringing services. I can confirm also that the offices have been opened,” explains Mulaudzi. In March 2017 some provincial departments took over services, which were previously provided at the municipal level. However, the auditor general raised concerns over the provincial government’s provision of services and recently the situation was worsened by budget cuts because money was redirected to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Cogta MEC Basikopo Makamu has now reopened the Vuwani municipal offices to allow the Collins Chabane municipality to provide services to the area. Makamu has signed a commitment letter with the Pro-Makhado Task Team to request the Municipal Demarcation Board to consider an investigation on the redetermination of municipal boundaries.
