Residents of Lenyenye, outside Tzaneen, in Limpopo, have raised concerns about a suspected serial rapist in the area. Police are investigating 17 cases since October. Six of the victims were allegedly raped by one perpetrator inside an abandoned house near the local community hall. The suspect is still at large. Limpopo Police Spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says investigations have been intensified. “The provincial police management in Limpopo is aware of the high number of rape cases that are being reported, specifically in Lenyenye. Already, 13 rape cases have been reported this month and some of the victims include girls as young as 13 and 15 years. A high-level team of investigators has been assembled to assist the family, violence, child protection and sexual offences unit in investigating these cases and already some of the suspects have been arrested. The Maake Station management has also been instructed to implement the proactive measures that have been put in place to address the factors that contribute to this scourge.” Limpopo Social Development Department Spokesperson Witness Tiva says social workers have been sent to victims and their families. “The matter of rape cases that have been reported in the Maake policing area, outside Tzaneen, has been brought to the attention of the Department of Social Development and we, immediately, dispatched teams of social workers to the area to ensure that they start providing psycho-social support to the affected victims and also to their families. We are also urging young people, women in particular to be very vigilant, (that) they avoid walking at night, when they do so they must walk in groups.” Gender-based violence (GBV) has spiked since the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak around the world:
