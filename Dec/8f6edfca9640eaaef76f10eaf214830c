With the number of coronavirus cases in Eswatini rising, the country announced its COVID-19 regulations on gatherings and travelling, which came to effect immediately after the announcement Friday night. Eswatini Deputy Prime Minister Themba Masuku says travelling and gatherings are the leading drivers of COVID-19 in that country. Masuku says no gathering of more than 20 people shall take place, people should not consume liquor at a gathering, including a family gathering of more than 20 people. Gatherings are prohibited after 8PM. Night vigils and cross-over events or parties are also prohibited. Meanwhile, the Eswatini government will embark on a COVID-19 door-to-door screening and testing exercise around the capital city of Mbabane. This week, Eswatini Prime Minister Ambrose Dlamini, who had tested positive for COVID-19 four weeks ago, died at age 52 after being hospitalised in South Africa. In a statement, Masuku said Dlamini was moved to South Africa on 1 December to “guide and fast track his recovery,” from COVID-19.  At that time, Masuku said Dlamini was stable and responding well to treatment.
