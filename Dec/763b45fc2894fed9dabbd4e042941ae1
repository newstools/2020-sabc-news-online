The trial of National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise is expected to continue on Wednesday, in the Potchefstroom Regional Court in the North West. She is facing a charge of animal cruelty. Lobby group, AfriForum, is leading the private prosecution of Modise. The video below is reporting on the animal cruelty case against Thandi Modise:  This follows a complaint which the National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) lodged in 2014 relating to the alleged negligence of her farm which resulted in a number of animals dying. Wednesday is the second day of the trial against Modise. She pleaded not guilty to six charges relating to an incident in 2014 when of carcasses of dead animals were found on her farm. On Tuesday, a police officer who took photographs of the scene at Modise’s farm took the stand.  The animals were allegedly left for two months without food and care. Although Modise believes her prosecution is politically motivated, AfriForum on the other hand believes it has a strong case against Modise.
