The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) in the Amathole region says more focus is needed in rural areas to educate communities about gender-based violence and femicide. They protested outside the Xhorha Magistrate’s Court in the Eastern Cape where Nowa Makula appeared for the brutal murder of his 42-year-old partner and her five children at Sidabekweni village. Makula allegedly hacked and killed Nomzamo Sikhundwana and her children, three of which are his biological children. Regional convener of the Women’s League RTT, Thembalam Xhego, also called on the court not to grant the suspect bail. “We are saying, we must continue embarking on awareness campaigns targeting rural areas. To the perpetrators, we are saying they must not get bail. They must rot in jail,” adds Xhego. The accused, who was escorted in court and chained on legs and hands, indicated that he wants a Shona language interpreter as he’s from Zimbabwe. He has also opted for a state representative. The case has been postponed to December 7 while he remains in custody. Makula is facing six counts of murder and one of conspiracy to murder. Meanwhile, the police had to use rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesting residents at court. The residents were preventing the police vehicle transporting the multi-murder suspect from exiting the court precinct. GRAPHIC CONTENT: The  family is  struggling to come to terms with the killings
