Cape Town High Court Judge, Siraj Desai says he has yet to see an apology from Brackenfell High School even though they have stated that they unequivocally condemn racism. The school has applied for an urgent interdict to prevent the EFF from protesting outside the school. The protest was in response to an alleged all-whites party at the school last month. Desai says he has not seen an apology from the school yet for any inferences of racism which may have been caused by a whites-only party that was attended by a group of 42 learners from Brackenfell High. The school’s legal team maintains that the event was a private party, which was organised by a group of parents and held at a private event. In a statement, the school has distanced itself from any allegations of racism. Desai says the fact that there are no statements in the court papers that contradict claims it was a whites-only party also gives rise to certain problems. Meanwhile, the Western Cape Department of Education says an investigation into the party shows there was no evidence of racism regarding the event. Western Cape Education Minister Debbie Schäfer says investigations into the racism furore at Brackenfell high school shows that there is no evidence of racism regarding a private party that was organised for matrics by their parents. She says the invitation was widely circulated on WhatsApp groups and extended to all matric learners regardless of race.
