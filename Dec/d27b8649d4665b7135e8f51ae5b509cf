The University of Mpumalanga says examinations won’t be postponed despite the ongoing protest by students. The students are protesting being evicted from off-campus accommodation. During the protest, a vehicle, tractor and guard room were set alight. Spokesperson for the University, Paul Mamindza, says students who are unable to write their exams will be given an opportunity to do so. “Exams are not suspended … in terms of what going to happen take it that we all understand that the problem here is the issue of students saying they have been evicted where they are staying in the accredited accommodation, yesterday we had a discussion with NSFAS there is information they asking for which we will be providing today.” Meanwhile, the university’s Dean of Students, Dr Paul Maminza last month said the exams were disrupted by workers who were picketing to call for the removal of its Vice-Chancellor. The workers, who are affiliated with the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu), picketed last month. They were accusing the university’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Thoko Mayekiso and other members of the management of corruption and mismanagement. Additional reporting by Mthobisi Mkhaliphi
