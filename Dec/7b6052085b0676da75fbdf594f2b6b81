The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) members led by General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali and First Deputy President Mike Shingange are staging a sit-in at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The picket seeks to defend the system of collective bargaining and demand a response to the memorandum submitted by Cosatu in October 2020, during the national day of action for decent work.
