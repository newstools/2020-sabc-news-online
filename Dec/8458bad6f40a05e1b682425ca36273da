The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it is unacceptable that eight people lost their lives while waiting in the queue to access services at the Beitbridge Border Post, outside Musina in Limpopo. The border post experienced heavy traffic congestion, processing 8 000 travellers daily, and delays in the two weeks leading to the Christmas holidays. The backlog has since been cleared. Coronavirus rapid testing and screening were also suspended as they were apparently contributing to the delays. The head of the commission in Limpopo, Victor Mavhidula, conducted a fact-finding mission at the border post on Tuesday. Minister Motsoaledi assures ease of traffic congestion at Beitbridge Border Post:  Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba, has also conducted a separate walkabout to monitor adherence to the COVID-19 lockdown regulations.
