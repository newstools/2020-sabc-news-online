Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says government printers contributed to the leaking of two matric exam papers. The High Court in Pretoria ruled against the planned re-write of the Maths Paper 2 and Physical Science Paper 2. Of the more than a million matriculants who wrote the exam, about 195 learners are believed to have illegally received the leaked papers. Investigators have traced the leakages to a company hired by the department to process and print exam papers, as well as the Government’s Printing Works. Motshekga says there are valid reasons to appeal the High Court decision. “The North Gauteng High Court ruling we feel did not deal with the core issue of integrity, credibility and the fairness of the 2020 exams. As we’ve communicated to the public we are going to approach the court because our findings are that the court’s findings are discontent with applicable basic education legislation.” The Minister yesterday briefed the media on the state of readiness of schools in the context of COVID-19:  Umalusi to work with relevant structures following leaked papers The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has welcomed quality assurance body Umalusi’s decision to work with the relevant structures following the leaking of matric exam papers. This after the DBE announced that there will be no rewrite of the leaked Maths Paper 2 and Physical Science Paper 2. The rewrites were scheduled for 15 and 17 December respectively.
