Mkhize has reiterated a call for people to take health and safety protocols seriously. “Most of the hospitals are filling up, there is a huge amount of exhaustion. People have been working through the first wave, which was a lot of pressure and a burden. There was no rest and then this came quite soon with most of the people not having to get rest. The private hospitals filled up before the public hospitals to an extent that there were a number of patients that were coming from the private sector under medical aids and being referred to public hospitals which put more pressure and in some of the small hospitals we have had to make sure there is additional oxygen.”  Importance of social distancing The Health Minister has also reiterated the importance of social distancing and avoiding crowded gatherings amid the festive season. Mkhize says people need to take health and safety protocols very seriously. “In a situation like this during the festive season, people are enjoying the holidays, meeting in crowded places, having parties, forgetting the masks, and not using distancing. People need to understand that if they are in a crowded place with poor ventilation you are likely to emerge with this infection. There are chances of having someone who has the infection in the crowd, be it, family members or friends they can well be infected.”  Meanwhile, the Coronavirus Command Council met yesterday to decide on whether further measures such as a tighter lockdown or stricter rules on public movement should be imposed.
