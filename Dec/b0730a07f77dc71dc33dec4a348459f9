Eskom says it lost a projected R7.3 million in revenue an Pampierstad in the Northern Cape, in the past financial year. This as the power utility is embarking on a meter audits in the area. Eskom says it is owed an estimated R43 billion by municipalities and customers throughout the country, and this is exacerbated by illegal connections and meter tampering. David Mabuza says rising municipal debt to Eskom poses a serious risk:  Eskom’s Spokesperson Stefanie Van Rensburg says they disconnected those they found to have tampered with the meters. “In the past year, we have lost the projected R7.3 million in revenue in Pampierstad only. We are, therefore, taking strict measures to curb further losses. We will be conducting metre audits in the area and this entails the checking of the meters to see if they were by-passed or tempered with. And if we do find the tempered meters, we will disconnect immediately and issue a tamper fine. The customers found to have tampered will only be reconnected when they have made payments.”
