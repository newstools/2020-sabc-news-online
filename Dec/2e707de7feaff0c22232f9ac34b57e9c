The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) in the Ngaka Modiri Molema Region in the North West, has expressed its disappointment that the mayor of Lekwa-Teemane local municipality, in Christiana, Mpho Pilane was granted bail by the Delareyville Magistrate’s Court. Thirty-six-year-old Pilane, has been charged on two counts of sexual assault, rape and abduction. He allegedly sexually assaulted and raped two girls aged 15 and 16. The League’s Regional Secretary, Dimakatso Malwane says, “We are very very disappointed because we learnt that if you don’t have money in our country, the justice system will never be on your side. Imagine, even though, those are allegations how can the mayor be granted a bail of R1000.” “But as the Women’s League in the North West, we won’t be silenced. Whatver that is happening, whether you have money or you don’t, or you are occupying a particular position in our organisation, we won’t keep quite,” explains Malwane. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with SABC News, after his court appearance, Pilane said he believes his case is politically motivated. Provincial National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Henry Mamothame, says Pilane will appear in court again in February. “The mayor of Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality, Mr Mpho Meshack Pilane, 36 years- old, had appeared at the Delarey Magistrates’ Court on two charges of rape, sexual assault and two of abduction. The complainants are said to be minors aged 15 and other 16 years. He appeared in the Delarey Magistrates’ Court and his case was remanded to February 22, 2021. He is out on R1 000 bail,” says Mamothame.
