Most concerning is the increase in hospitalisations and deaths. Head of the Western Cape Department of Health Doctor Keith Cloete says hospitalisations and proportion positive numbers are headed toward levels seen at the peak of the first wave.  Cloete says there has been a reported 48% increase of cases last week alone. “We can also confirm that our reported deaths and very importantly, our reported hospitalisations, the provincial figure like this basically means we had a 48% increase in the last week and you can see the proportion positive is now starting to approximate what we saw in the first wave – about 35% positivity of all samples sent to the lab and the key message is that hospitalisation and that proportion positive is increasing and we are now approximating both for death and hospitalisation, what we saw in the first peak, although the cases have already exceeded the first peak.”
