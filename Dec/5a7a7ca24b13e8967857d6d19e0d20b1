The SABC Board is demanding a retraction by the Sunday World for an article headlined “Broadcaster Blasts News Boss.” The public broadcaster says the article contains several false, misleading and fictitious information about alleged SABC Board’s decision on the Group Executive: News and Current Affairs, Phathiswa Magopeni. The SABC Board says that it has never had any discussions or taken any decision to charge Magopeni. During a heated meeting with staff members at the SABC Newsroom on planned retrenchments by the public broadcaster in November, Magopeni said she would no longer be issuing letters of retrenchment and suggested a new process be initiated. A number of SABC employees had refused to complete their shifts for the day with some saying they will not go on air. SABC GE of News agrees to temporarily suspend issuing of retrenchment letters:  The Board also rejects the claim by the Sunday World that a disciplinary process has been kick-started against Magopeni. SABC acting-spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo says, “The board is deeply concerned that the Sunday World, relying on information allegedly from some board members, has completely invented a board discussion including the alleged charges levelled against Ms Magopeni. The board strongly rejects the claim by the Sunday World that a disciplinary process has been kick started by the board against Ms Magopeni. It should be noted that Ms Magopeni does not report directly to the board and therefore the Sunday World’s claims are baseless and without fact. The SABC board demands a retraction by the Sunday World for this false and misleading article.”
